With Minouche Shafik,"This is an audio transcript of The Economics Show podcast episode: ‘What future for aid and development? With Minouche Shafik’

Alan Beattie
Hello. Alan Beattie here. I just want to let you know that the episode you’re about to listen to was recorded a few short hours before the UK government announced plans to cut its aid budget from 0.5 per cent of GDP to 0.3 per cent. Sometimes interviews get overtaken by events, but as you’ll hear in her very first answer, my guest today proved quite prescient about what was about to happen.

One of the very first things that Donald Trump did upon taking office was to suspend all US foreign aid, threatening the programme which has put 20mn people with HIV in developing countries on antiretroviral drugs. The following weekend, Elon Musk, as part of his rampage through the federal government, single-handedly put “through the woodchipper”, in his own words, the US Agency for International Development. That’s the US aid body which was set up by President Kennedy in 1961 and last year disbursed more than $40bn a year in around 130 countries.

After several years in which budgetary constraints in rich countries had already led to aid being cut back, this was a serious blow to low-income countries dependent on assistance. At the same time, financial flows from rising powers like China, India, Saudi Arabia and Russia have been increasing. What will the new world of aid and development look like and how, with a, let’s say, turbulent outlook for geopolitics and trade mean for low- and middle-income countries?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

I’m Alan Beattie, the FT’s senior trade writer, and this is The Economics Show from the Financial Times. I’m joined here in London by Minouche Shafik.

Minouche is almost embarrassingly well-qualified to talk about this subject. Former vice-president at the World Bank, a deputy managing director of the IMF, a permanent secretary, the most senior civil servant at the UK Department for International Development when it was regarded as the cutting edge of aid. I could honestly go on for about an hour just reading out your CV, I think, but let me just finish it. Deputy governor of the Bank of England, director of the London School of Economics, and after a stint in the US as president of Columbia University, she’s back in the UK, a member of the House of Lords and undertaking a review of development policy for Keir Starmer’s government. Minouche, welcome.

Minouche Shafik
Thank you so much, Alan, for that very generous introduction.

Alan Beattie
So we always start the Economics Show with a simple question, which we ask you to answer on a scale of one to 10. So maybe 10, 15 years ago, certainly 20 years ago, the aid and development business really looked like it was on the up. Aid budgets were rising. The US had launched some big programmes. Best practices were being worked out. What’s the likelihood, one to 10, in the foreseeable future, we get back to a situation like that?

Minouche Shafik
One.

Alan Beattie
Wow. Really? That’s actually the most pessimistic I’ve ever heard anyone answer one of those questions. 

Minouche Shafik
I think the world is very, very different today. I’m not saying that we won’t have a world in which international development matters, but I think the way it works will change fundamentally. 

Alan Beattie
OK, so let’s unpack that. You’ve come back to the UK after a while abroad and as I was saying, UK used to be one of the great leaders on aid. DfID, the Department for International Development was widely regarded as best practice. DfID no longer exists, it’s been folded into the Foreign Office. So what do you think the future for UK aid is, and what do you think it should be? 

Minouche Shafik
Well, you know, that moment that you referred to, around in the 2000s, (inaudible) after the millennium, a time of great optimism and international solidarity and a real positive-sum view of the world. And there was this moment when we had a coalition of leading politicians, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and others around the world, plus NGOs plus celebrities, plus very widespread public support. And that was true in the UK, but it was also true in many European countries and in parts of the US.

Today, we see in the polling that public perceptions have changed. There is cynicism about aid. People are concerned about domestic issues. They worry about waste and corruption, and the view of the US administration of international relations is essentially zero-sum. You know, that you win, I lose. And so seeing a much more kind of instrumental, self-interested view of the world. And I think we have to think about the future of international development in that very, very different context. 

Alan Beattie
So just to stay with the UK for a moment, as I say, this department, DfID, was widely admired, folded into the Foreign Office. Do you think there’s a likelihood that it will be pulled out, set up as a standalone agency, you know, given more independence? 

Minouche Shafik
So the UK made that decision under Boris Johnson’s government in 2019. And I think in retrospect that was a very poor decision. The UK lost a huge amount of capacity and respect internationally as a result of that. Now, I should say the UK wasn’t the only country that did that. The Canadians did it, the Australians did it. And I think that given where we are and given the changes in the world, the likelihood of going back to the old structure is very low. You know, you would lose a huge amount of time of untangling that merger. And the question is, what do we do now? What can we do differently now that would respond to the moment that we’re in?

Alan Beattie
So you mentioned this was not just a UK phenomenon. There was a retreat from aid worldwide. And I know too, even the EU, which prides itself on this, you know, internationalist outlook, has been cutting aid from sub-Saharan Africa, redirecting it to Ukraine. Given this was such a widespread phenomenon and it’s been going on for some time, was there one particular thing? Was it the global financial crisis? Was it Donald Trump himself? Was there something that sparked everyone, as it were, in the world, in the rich world, anyway, to act in the same way? 

Minouche Shafik
I think there were two things. One is the backlash against globalisation after the international financial crisis and the concerns about unequal benefits and how that crisis was handled, and the winners and losers of globalisation. And the second thing was fiscal pressures. You see it across a number of countries now where there are serious fiscal pressures around public services, and today an increased pressure to spend more on the military. And those combined forces have meant that more and more traditional aid donors have been cutting their budgets. You see it across Europe, in the UK and now the US. But it’s important to note that total aid spending in the world actually continues to go up. The total number at the moment is about $225bn a year. But the composition of that is changing. European donors are becoming less important. Countries like China, the Gulf, Turkey and South Korea are becoming more important. 

Alan Beattie
So we’ll definitely get on to that later. Another question about aid was I used to have this particular bee in my bonnet that everyone always used to measure the volume of aid. We need to get up to 0.70 per cent of GDP. You know, I still remember all the badges where everyone had 0.7. All the big donor conferences, the 2005 Gleneagles conference, they were all about volume. At the same time, I never thought there was enough focus on quality. And what you’ve seen now is not just people cutting aid budgets, but also people counting basically military spending as aid, counting spending on refugees in the donor’s own country as aid. I mean, do you agree? Do you think that we were always focused on the width and not enough on the quality? 

Minouche Shafik
I do agree that quality matters more than quantity, and what has happened in terms of broadening the definition has become very extreme. And I think it’s better to be honest about what you’re actually doing, and calling development assistance, development assistance and calling refugee costs, refugee costs.

It’s mad that often the biggest recipient of the country’s aid budget is itself because it’s spending most of it at home. The US is a good example of that. US aid is earmarked and has to be spent on American contractors and consultants and shipping and supplies. And so the biggest recipient is the United States. And we know that higher-quality aid means spending more of it locally and using local institutions and local capacity, and building that so that countries can stand up on their own feet. 

Alan Beattie
So moving to the US, apart from thinking that closing down USAID is a bad idea, which you’ve written about recently in the FT, what do you make of the Trump development policy so far? Is it actually animated by anything apart from prejudice? 

Minouche Shafik
I mean, I don’t think there is a development policy at the moment. There’s only a policy to destroy USAID. And of course, every development organisation in the world can improve and there are always inefficiencies that can be addressed. But there is also a huge amount of evidence that many things have been very, very effective. And so a real policy would try and look at those issues squarely.

I think the other thing that’s quite clear is that merging development agencies into the diplomatic service, into the state department, as has been done with USAID, inevitably results in a huge diminishment of capacity. I often say these days the world is becoming more political, but it’s also becoming more technical. And the capacity you need to solve things like climate change or trade issues or pandemics, those issues require deep technical expertise, and when you eliminate your aid agency, you lose that expertise. 

Alan Beattie
I mean, there’s always been a big political dimension to foreign policy, right? As I say with Kennedy that set up USAID, it wasn’t entirely selfless, and it’s been one way of selling it to American people that this is a sort of arm of foreign policy, going right back to the Marshall Plan. We’re now seeing deals like the minerals deal, which President Trump is offering — that’s the word — Ukraine, whereby they give control over their minerals or revenues from their minerals to the US. Is this just an extension of what we’ve seen before? Or is something really different? 

Minouche Shafik
I mean, you’re right, USAID was born after the cold war, and John F Kennedy created it in the ‘60s as a tool of foreign policy. I think what we’re seeing now is a shift in the motivation for aid. You know, you can give aid to a country for three reasons: in your own interests, in their interests, or for mutual benefit. And arguably in the heyday of the Millennium Development Goals in the aid business after the millennium, there was a very strong focus on giving aid for the countries’ benefit, for the recipients’ benefit and for their wellbeing. I think the pendulum is shifting now to self-interest, to doing it purely for the donor’s interest.

I would like to think that actually, the most sustainable place to be is to find a space for mutual benefit. You know, if you think about an issue like climate change, it’s quite obvious that you can’t solve that without partnerships and looking at the mutual interests of countries involved. Similarly, with migration or pandemics or even economic growth, these are things where you can identify clear areas where the interests of rich countries and poor countries are quite aligned and where there’s quite a lot that can be done. 

Alan Beattie
So if this is the way that Trump development policy is going to . . . and if it emerges from the chaos at the moment, that it’s going to be more hard-nosed, it’s going to be American interests, does that mean geographically in certain parts of the world or to certain parts of countries, they’re going to be receiving more than they have in the past? 

Minouche Shafik
No. There will definitely be a geographical shift. One is you’re already seeing a change in the way the aid money is being spent. For a very long time, there was a very strong focus on reducing poverty in developing countries — getting kids into school, delivering basic healthcare like vaccinations and so on. That money is being squeezed at the moment. And where you’re seeing the money going now is increasingly on humanitarian spend because there are so many conflicts in the world at the moment and so many chronic humanitarian crises. And second, on climate change, which rich countries see as in their interest to have climate change addressed. And an area I think of growing focus going forward is going to be migration, as more and more countries are concerned about immigration issues and the consequences for their domestic politics. 

Alan Beattie
Before we leave the US, you know, I was in Washington 20 years ago, a bit more when the Bush administration actually set up this program to combat HIV/Aids in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. And it came as a big surprise to lots of us I think that, you know, really quite a conservative administration like Bush’s would vote for it. And my view was always actually, this wasn’t very cynical, it wasn’t soft power. It just managed to tap into a particular Republican strain of thinking, quite religious strain of thinking about wanting to help people. Does that strain still exist? I mean, does it exist in the administration? Does it exist still in Congress? 

Minouche Shafik
Interestingly, what the polling shows is that when you ask people, why should you give aid, the main argument people give is to do good. The self-interested kind of soft power arguments are not on the top of the list. And so people believe in that motive, but they want to know that the money is being spent well. 

Alan Beattie
One thing that a lot of campaigners focused on, whether it’s accurate or not, is their perceptions of increasing inequality. Now, you know, at a global level, for a long time that wasn’t necessarily true, but people believed it was true. Within countries, often there was an increase in inequality. What would you think that plays in overall outcomes? 

Minouche Shafik
So the perception is often very different than the reality. But the perception matters. You know, I saw a very interesting piece of research which looked at people’s attitudes if they grew up in a period of low growth and social mobility. You tend to have a zero-sum view of the world, and you tend to be less trusting and less willing to see the world in a win-win sort of way. And there is a significant part of the US population which has experienced low growth and low social mobility, because the globalisation that we’ve had in recent decades has given very high rewards to people who are educated, and very low rewards to people who didn’t have a university-level education. And so you can see why there is a backlash, and it reflects a failure of the educational system and the economy to share those opportunities more widely. 

Alan Beattie
OK. So let’s talk about what the end point of this is all supposed to be, which is actual development outcomes. People living longer, lower infant mortality, lower maternal mortality, and so forth. Now, despite everything, despite Covid, which is obviously a big setback, overall welfare as measured by human development indicators, it’s on an upward trend that seems to be recovering. Is everything OK despite everything? Can we continue to reduce poverty even without aid? 

Minouche Shafik
I think it’s really important to hammer home this point that the so-called development era, which is kind of the world since, let’s say, 1950, the progress that we have made in the world in that period in terms of incomes, poverty reduction, better health, education, nutrition, every single measure of human progress has been more than what was achieved throughout all of human history. It’s just worth dwelling on that for a moment. You know, we’ve had 10 times more progress than in all of human history. People in 1950 used to die in their forties. Now average life expectancy is 71 globally. We’ve got almost every kid in the world into primary school. We’ve achieved gender equality so that every girl, just like every boy, gets access to education. You know, in 1950, half the world’s population was poor. Today it’s less than 10 per cent. So it has been a phenomenal success.

Now the question is: was that because of aid? And the problem, as always in economics, you don’t know what the counterfactual is. You can’t rerun the world for the last 75 years and say what would have happened without aid. But what we do know in thousands and thousands of studies that have been done, whether it’s randomised controlled trials or econometric studies or case studies, is that when aid was well-designed, the outcomes were incredibly positive. 

Alan Beattie
And how much of this was just technological improvements, particularly in health? You know, one thing I still struggle to get my head around is that my grandmother, who was from a, you know, reasonably well-off background in England, had polio. She was paralysed for two months during the second world war of polio. And then she recovered and then she was fine and so forth. And it’s quite dramatic looking back, even in advanced countries, how measles for children and tuberculosis even, for a long time, persisted. Now those were technological gains, vaccines and so on, which were largely developed in advanced economies. But how much of it was that? How much of it was just 1) it was technological improvements and 2) it was actually rich countries producing stuff that was mainly focused on themselves? You know, one of the first uses of penicillin was for soldiers in the second world war, right? 

Minouche Shafik
So definitely technological progress and vaccines played an incredibly important role in reducing infant mortality. Clean water, hugely transformative in terms of increasing life expectancy around the world. And then I think the other thing I’d say is education and getting most kids, at least through primary school, that had huge knock-on benefits in terms of life expectancy, higher incomes, better nutrition and so on. And so those basic things have had huge consequences, I would say. 

Alan Beattie
OK, so let’s throw to a break. But when we’re back, I’m going to ask what about developing countries themselves in all of these? What are they thinking? Do they have a collective voice? And above all, what’s the role of China?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

And we’re back. So there’s this term global south, which aims to take in all low- and middle-income countries. I’m personally not a fan. I’ve made quite a few enemies by not being a fan. And one reason I don’t really like it is there’s this huge amount of differentiation within those countries, and yet there are often some governments, like China and India, which claim to speak on behalf of the global south. You know, India convenes a meeting called the voices of the global south. Is there such a thing as a single developing country, a single emerging market interest? 

Minouche Shafik
So I confess, I don’t really like the term myself, and I avoid using it because . . . 

Alan Beattie
An ally. I finally have found an ally . . . 

Minouche Shafik
Because I mean, different countries are very different from each other. They have different interests. And countries like China, India, South Africa, Brazil, these are middle-income countries with significant and growing power with a significant voice on the global stage. They are members of the G20. They have large economic interests and they have some power. And the second group are kind of small- and medium-sized, low- and middle-income countries who, you know, are making development progress but don’t have significant power on the global stage. And then you have these fragile and conflict-affected countries where most of the poverty is, where the humanitarian crises are and where their governments are very, very weak.

The one issue that I think they do have in common is they would all agree that the current international system, as constructed after World War II, doesn’t give them enough voice. And that is the one issue that I think ties them together. What they would do with that voice is probably very different because they have different interests and different agendas. 

Alan Beattie
So you mentioned the G20. You know, there’s an institution that has elevated the heads of government level during the global financial crisis. And that was supposed to be the great institution which was going to bring people in. The US, I think, has now said it’s not going to even attend this particular meeting. I think maybe China has not attended some meetings in the past. Has the G20 failed? 

Minouche Shafik
So I often describe the G20 like a tea bag. It only works when it’s in hot water. And so it’s been very useful at moments of international crisis. But for routine business it tends to trundle along, not having a lot of impact. 

Alan Beattie
And why is that? 

Minouche Shafik
Because people in a moment of crisis are forced to co-operate. Whether it was the 2008 financial crisis or even during major conflicts, they have to make compromises to co-operate. 

Alan Beattie
So you’re talking about low- and middle-income countries feeling somewhat excluded from structures of governance. Traditionally, of course, that’s absolutely true. You know, it used to be a small gang of countries that stitched up deals in the WTO. Europe in particular is still heavily over-represented on the governing boards of both the World Bank and the IMF where I used to work. Now, this is another subject where I make myself some enemies, which is to point out every time the leadership role from these institutions comes up, the emerging market world completely fails to unite behind sometimes extremely impressive candidates. Why is that? 

Minouche Shafik
Yes, I think it often is because the powers that be are very good at divide and rule. And so they manage to create divisions among the developing countries to be able to advance their own agendas. I think that’s the crux of it. Governance reform in these institutions has been on the agenda for decades, and we have made so little progress. It is extremely frustrating.

And you know it is true that the biggest problem is mainly Europe who is over-represented. The US is actually not over-represented very much in the boards of these institutions. It’s the Europeans. And unless they find a way to accommodate more developing countries and give them a seat at the table equivalent to their economic importance, the relevance of these institutions will diminish. 

Alan Beattie
I mean, there’s a lot of rivalry between the emerging markets. I think someone ran the numbers and said, if you just updated the voting power on the IMF executive board to reflect what’s changed in the global economy, China’s representation would shoot up to something like 17, 18 per cent. India’s would still be three or something per cent. And what someone else has said to me is you won’t have a Chinese president of the World Bank or managing director of International Monetary Fund because India would rather have an American or a European in that role. Similarly, you won’t have an Indian because the Chinese prefer an American over an Indian. So there seems to be this outward solidarity. But in practice, India and China have been to war with each other three times. These countries are rivals and they’re not as much as friends. 

Minouche Shafik
Yes, that is true. That is true. And I think the important question, though, is are these institutions truly representative? The issues around who the head is, those kind of things, those are symbolically very important. But in the end, unless you’ve got a shareholding where people feel it reflects the real world, not the world as it was in the middle of the 20th century, they will have less stake in these institutions. And if you lose a large part of the world around that table because they don’t feel that they are being heard, that’s a big loss. 

Alan Beattie
In the absence of this, what China in particular has done is set up its own institutions, like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, for example, which some see as a sort of parallel to the World Bank. Is that just because China wants to control institutions? Was it inevitable from that point of view? Or was it genuinely because they felt themselves squeezed out of the World Bank and the IMF?

Minouche Shafik
So I think China’s been riding two horses for a while, participating and arguing for more voice in the existing international system, while at the same time creating a parallel system as a kind of plan B. These days, it feels like, because they’re frustrated with progress and because the geopolitical rivalry with the US has grown even more intense, plan B has become plan A, and those parallel institutions have growing memberships and growing resources. They’re still very nascent, and if there was a breakthrough in the existing international system, I think it can be salvaged. But on the current trajectory, we are moving toward parallel systems.

Alan Beattie
Now, we’re also moving towards a situation where some of the big emerging markets, better-off emerging markets, are donors rather than aid recipients — India, China, Russia, Saudi and so forth. How is that working? How is the way that they disburse aid and they use aid different from the way that traditional aid donors have done so?

Minouche Shafik
Their aid tends to be linked to commercial interests and is often focused on infrastructure rather than, say, human development, health, education and so on.

Alan Beattie
And as such, it’s better or worse, do you think, than traditional aid?

Minouche Shafik
It’s a debate about that. (Alan laughs) It’s very interesting. You know, if you talk to, say, policymakers in Africa, they will sometimes say, well, look, at least it’s tangible. I got a railroad or a football stadium or a highway as a result of that. And the conditionality tends to be more around commercial interests rather than whether your country’s democratic and what your human rights situation is.

So some people think that is better. Others would say it is very, very commercially minded. And so they are getting mining rights or rights to run infrastructure facilities like ports for very, very long-term contracts.

Alan Beattie
So from that point of view, what the US is doing in Ukraine is actually sort of coming into line with what China has done for a long time.

Minouche Shafik
You could say that. (Laughter)

Alan Beattie
I mean, the Chinese programme, in particular the Belt and Road Initiative, and it was huge at one point, around all over southern Africa, and that seems to have pulled back a bit. There seems to be some feeling that even in an autocracy like China, money had been wasted, projects hadn’t worked and it wasn’t wise for them to continue to put their money at risk in that way.

Minouche Shafik
Well, I do think that some aspects of Belt and Road are being reassessed, in particular the fact that many countries accumulated very large debts as a result of the Belt and Road Initiative, and it put China in the awkward position of being the major creditor to many countries in Africa. And working through the consequences of that has been very difficult.

You know, a country like Zambia has spent the last three years trying to restructure its debt, most of which is to China. And that has been a very difficult process for many African countries and I think also for the Chinese. Having said that, the Chinese have just committed an additional $50bn to Africa over the next few years, so they continue to be very major players.

Alan Beattie
China as a creditor is very interesting because one thing they have done is say we are not a traditional creditor, we’re not going to join traditional creditor organisations like the Paris Club of rich countries. We are a developing country ourselves and therefore we can’t be expected to be treated like other creditors. What do you think of that? Do you think that’s something that they’ll have to shift?

Minouche Shafik
I do think that we need a much better approach for dealing with these huge debt overhangs that are really affecting many countries in Africa. Many, many countries are now spending much more on servicing their debts than they are on health and education domestically, and many of their debts are unsustainable.

China also says these are not official debts. These are commercial debts by our commercial banks to their commercial entities and so there isn’t a real role for the state. But of course, China’s banks ultimately are state-owned, and so the line between what is official and what is private is more complicated.

Alan Beattie
And here’s the problem with the global south. I mean, another thing that people say about the global south is, oh, it’s not just about income being developing. It’s about their historic experience, their postcolonial experience.

Now, yes, China did obviously have a time of being occupied and controlled by western powers. At the same time, if you ask most Chinese people and if you look at Chinese history, I think they would regard themselves as having been an imperial power rather than a colony. So in a sense, the continuation of ideas like the global south or developing country interest is not very helpful here.

Minouche Shafik
Yeah. I mean, I think like on many, many international issues, you get coalitions of interest around particular issues at a particular moment in time. And at the moment, there is a very large coalition of developing countries who are highly indebted and whose debt burdens are unsustainable, and they have an interest in getting their debt restructured. And given what’s happening to aid budgets, that will put even more pressure on budgets in poor countries, and they will have to start finding resources to pay for the HIV drugs and the vaccinations and the schoolteachers that were being supported by aid before.

And so this will only make this debt issue more acute and more important for both western, you know, European and Americans, but also the Chinese to solve. It will become the biggest development issue over the next few years.

Alan Beattie
OK. So finally, final question: if we could make you supreme dictator of the world . . . (Minouche laughs) If you could wave a wand, and effect just one, but just one big policy change on behalf of all governments in the world, what would it be?

Minouche Shafik
OK. I’m going to give you one answer, but then I wanna have a thing I could wish for, but I don’t know the answer for. So the one answer, I guess, is that we are entering a very different period demographically and we’ve got ageing populations almost everywhere except Africa, and we need young people of the next generation to be incredibly productive to be able to support these ageing populations.

And so I would want massive investment in early years and the first thousand days of life in health and nutrition, because we know, from very good development experience, that investing in that period massively increases educational attainment and employment opportunities and productivity later in life.

And if we did that across the board and gave every child in the world that really good start, I think that would transform both what’s happening in developing countries — it would help with ageing societies, which is a big problem in the advanced economies — and it would do a huge amount for reducing inequality. That’s the one where I know there’s an answer.

Alan Beattie
If the kids are all right, then everyone will be all right.

Minouche Shafik
Yeah, I think that’s true. The other thing that I lament in the policymaking world globally is the myopia of our politics. You know, if you look across so many domains, you know, that classic Benjamin Franklin quote about an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, it applies in pandemic preparedness, it applies to climate change, it applies to humanitarian crises, it applies to healthcare.

And yet our political systems are unable to make the wise decisions around prevention and investing in prevention because of our political cycles, because of the way we count things fiscally so that the benefits don’t show up, if they don’t show up in a long time, nobody cares at the present. And so if there was a way that we could count things and change the accountability of politicians to get better decision making for the long term, we would be a lot better off. But I don’t have an answer to do that.

Alan Beattie
Minouche, thank you for coming in. Thanks very much for your time.

Minouche Shafik
Pleasure. Thank you, Alan.

That’s all for this week. You’ve been listening to The Economics Show from the FT. This episode was produced by Laurence Knight with original music from Breen Turner. Our executive producer is Manuela Saragosa. Cheryl Brumley is the FT’s global head of audio. I’m Alan Beattie. Thanks for listening.

[MUSIC PLAYING]",FEB 27 2025,Transcript,Transcript: What future for aid and development? With Minouche Shafik,Alan Beattie talks to Minouche Shafik,Alan Beattie,Print this page,(opens in new window),"Alan Beattie
Hello. Alan Beattie here. I just want to let you know that the episode you’re about to listen to was recorded a few short hours before the UK government announced plans to cut its aid budget from 0.5 per cent of GDP to 0.3 per cent. Sometimes interviews get overtaken by events, but as you’ll hear in her very first answer, my guest today proved quite prescient about what was about to happen. One of the very first things that Donald Trump did upon taking office was to suspend all US foreign aid, threatening the programme which has put 20mn people with HIV in developing countries on antiretroviral drugs. The following weekend, Elon Musk, as part of his rampage through the federal government, single-handedly put “through the woodchipper”, in his own words, the US Agency for International Development. That’s the US aid body which was set up by President Kennedy in 1961 and last year disbursed more than $40bn a year in around 130 countries.  After several years in which budgetary constraints in rich countries had already led to aid being cut back, this was a serious blow to low-income countries dependent on assistance. At the same time, financial flows from rising powers like China, India, Saudi Arabia and Russia have been increasing. What will the new world of aid and development look like and how, with a, let’s say, turbulent outlook for geopolitics and trade mean for low- and middle-income countries?  [MUSIC PLAYING]  I’m Alan Beattie, the FT’s senior trade writer, and this is The Economics Show from the Financial Times. I’m joined here in London by Minouche Shafik.  Minouche is almost embarrassingly well-qualified to talk about this subject. Former vice-president at the World Bank, a deputy managing director of the IMF, a permanent secretary, the most senior civil servant at the UK Department for International Development when it was regarded as the cutting edge of aid. I could honestly go on for about an hour just reading out your CV, I think, but let me just finish it. Deputy governor of the Bank of England, director of the London School of Economics, and after a stint in the US as president of Columbia University, she’s back in the UK, a member of the House of Lords and undertaking a review of development policy for Keir Starmer’s government. Minouche, welcome. Minouche Shafik
Thank you so much, Alan, for that very generous introduction. Alan Beattie
So we always start the Economics Show with a simple question, which we ask you to answer on a scale of one to 10. So maybe 10, 15 years ago, certainly 20 years ago, the aid and development business really looked like it was on the up. Aid budgets were rising. The US had launched some big programmes. Best practices were being worked out. What’s the likelihood, one to 10, in the foreseeable future, we get back to a situation like that? Minouche Shafik
One.

Alan Beattie
Wow. Really? That’s actually the most pessimistic I’ve ever heard anyone answer one of those questions.  Minouche Shafik
I think the world is very, very different today. I’m not saying that we won’t have a world in which international development matters, but I think the way it works will change fundamentally.  Alan Beattie
OK, so let’s unpack that. You’ve come back to the UK after a while abroad and as I was saying, UK used to be one of the great leaders on aid. DfID, the Department for International Development was widely regarded as best practice. DfID no longer exists, it’s been folded into the Foreign Office. So what do you think the future for UK aid is, and what do you think it should be?  Minouche Shafik
Well, you know, that moment that you referred to, around in the 2000s, (inaudible) after the millennium, a time of great optimism and international solidarity and a real positive-sum view of the world. And there was this moment when we had a coalition of leading politicians, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and others around the world, plus NGOs plus celebrities, plus very widespread public support. And that was true in the UK, but it was also true in many European countries and in parts of the US. Today, we see in the polling that public perceptions have changed. There is cynicism about aid. People are concerned about domestic issues. They worry about waste and corruption, and the view of the US administration of international relations is essentially zero-sum. You know, that you win, I lose. And so seeing a much more kind of instrumental, self-interested view of the world. And I think we have to think about the future of international development in that very, very different context.  Alan Beattie
So just to stay with the UK for a moment, as I say, this department, DfID, was widely admired, folded into the Foreign Office. Do you think there’s a likelihood that it will be pulled out, set up as a standalone agency, you know, given more independence?  Minouche Shafik
So the UK made that decision under Boris Johnson’s government in 2019. And I think in retrospect that was a very poor decision. The UK lost a huge amount of capacity and respect internationally as a result of that. Now, I should say the UK wasn’t the only country that did that. The Canadians did it, the Australians did it. And I think that given where we are and given the changes in the world, the likelihood of going back to the old structure is very low. You know, you would lose a huge amount of time of untangling that merger. And the question is, what do we do now? What can we do differently now that would respond to the moment that we’re in? Alan Beattie
So you mentioned this was not just a UK phenomenon. There was a retreat from aid worldwide. And I know too, even the EU, which prides itself on this, you know, internationalist outlook, has been cutting aid from sub-Saharan Africa, redirecting it to Ukraine. Given this was such a widespread phenomenon and it’s been going on for some time, was there one particular thing? Was it the global financial crisis? Was it Donald Trump himself? Was there something that sparked everyone, as it were, in the world, in the rich world, anyway, to act in the same way?  Minouche Shafik
I think there were two things. One is the backlash against globalisation after the international financial crisis and the concerns about unequal benefits and how that crisis was handled, and the winners and losers of globalisation. And the second thing was fiscal pressures. You see it across a number of countries now where there are serious fiscal pressures around public services, and today an increased pressure to spend more on the military. And those combined forces have meant that more and more traditional aid donors have been cutting their budgets. You see it across Europe, in the UK and now the US. But it’s important to note that total aid spending in the world actually continues to go up. The total number at the moment is about $225bn a year. But the composition of that is changing. European donors are becoming less important. Countries like China, the Gulf, Turkey and South Korea are becoming more important.  Alan Beattie
So we’ll definitely get on to that later. Another question about aid was I used to have this particular bee in my bonnet that everyone always used to measure the volume of aid. We need to get up to 0.70 per cent of GDP. You know, I still remember all the badges where everyone had 0.7. All the big donor conferences, the 2005 Gleneagles conference, they were all about volume. At the same time, I never thought there was enough focus on quality. And what you’ve seen now is not just people cutting aid budgets, but also people counting basically military spending as aid, counting spending on refugees in the donor’s own country as aid. I mean, do you agree? Do you think that we were always focused on the width and not enough on the quality?  Minouche Shafik
I do agree that quality matters more than quantity, and what has happened in terms of broadening the definition has become very extreme. And I think it’s better to be honest about what you’re actually doing, and calling development assistance, development assistance and calling refugee costs, refugee costs. It’s mad that often the biggest recipient of the country’s aid budget is itself because it’s spending most of it at home. The US is a good example of that. US aid is earmarked and has to be spent on American contractors and consultants and shipping and supplies. And so the biggest recipient is the United States. And we know that higher-quality aid means spending more of it locally and using local institutions and local capacity, and building that so that countries can stand up on their own feet.  Alan Beattie
So moving to the US, apart from thinking that closing down USAID is a bad idea, which you’ve written about recently in the FT, what do you make of the Trump development policy so far? Is it actually animated by anything apart from prejudice?  Minouche Shafik
I mean, I don’t think there is a development policy at the moment. There’s only a policy to destroy USAID. And of course, every development organisation in the world can improve and there are always inefficiencies that can be addressed. But there is also a huge amount of evidence that many things have been very, very effective. And so a real policy would try and look at those issues squarely. I think the other thing that’s quite clear is that merging development agencies into the diplomatic service, into the state department, as has been done with USAID, inevitably results in a huge diminishment of capacity. I often say these days the world is becoming more political, but it’s also becoming more technical. And the capacity you need to solve things like climate change or trade issues or pandemics, those issues require deep technical expertise, and when you eliminate your aid agency, you lose that expertise.  Alan Beattie
I mean, there’s always been a big political dimension to foreign policy, right? As I say with Kennedy that set up USAID, it wasn’t entirely selfless, and it’s been one way of selling it to American people that this is a sort of arm of foreign policy, going right back to the Marshall Plan. We’re now seeing deals like the minerals deal, which President Trump is offering — that’s the word — Ukraine, whereby they give control over their minerals or revenues from their minerals to the US. Is this just an extension of what we’ve seen before? Or is something really different?  Minouche Shafik
I mean, you’re right, USAID was born after the cold war, and John F Kennedy created it in the ‘60s as a tool of foreign policy. I think what we’re seeing now is a shift in the motivation for aid. You know, you can give aid to a country for three reasons: in your own interests, in their interests, or for mutual benefit. And arguably in the heyday of the Millennium Development Goals in the aid business after the millennium, there was a very strong focus on giving aid for the countries’ benefit, for the recipients’ benefit and for their wellbeing. I think the pendulum is shifting now to self-interest, to doing it purely for the donor’s interest. I would like to think that actually, the most sustainable place to be is to find a space for mutual benefit. You know, if you think about an issue like climate change, it’s quite obvious that you can’t solve that without partnerships and looking at the mutual interests of countries involved. Similarly, with migration or pandemics or even economic growth, these are things where you can identify clear areas where the interests of rich countries and poor countries are quite aligned and where there’s quite a lot that can be done.  Alan Beattie
So if this is the way that Trump development policy is going to . . . and if it emerges from the chaos at the moment, that it’s going to be more hard-nosed, it’s going to be American interests, does that mean geographically in certain parts of the world or to certain parts of countries, they’re going to be receiving more than they have in the past?  Minouche Shafik
No. There will definitely be a geographical shift. One is you’re already seeing a change in the way the aid money is being spent. For a very long time, there was a very strong focus on reducing poverty in developing countries — getting kids into school, delivering basic healthcare like vaccinations and so on. That money is being squeezed at the moment. And where you’re seeing the money going now is increasingly on humanitarian spend because there are so many conflicts in the world at the moment and so many chronic humanitarian crises. And second, on climate change, which rich countries see as in their interest to have climate change addressed. And an area I think of growing focus going forward is going to be migration, as more and more countries are concerned about immigration issues and the consequences for their domestic politics.  Alan Beattie
Before we leave the US, you know, I was in Washington 20 years ago, a bit more when the Bush administration actually set up this program to combat HIV/Aids in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. And it came as a big surprise to lots of us I think that, you know, really quite a conservative administration like Bush’s would vote for it. And my view was always actually, this wasn’t very cynical, it wasn’t soft power. It just managed to tap into a particular Republican strain of thinking, quite religious strain of thinking about wanting to help people. Does that strain still exist? I mean, does it exist in the administration? Does it exist still in Congress?  Minouche Shafik
Interestingly, what the polling shows is that when you ask people, why should you give aid, the main argument people give is to do good. The self-interested kind of soft power arguments are not on the top of the list. And so people believe in that motive, but they want to know that the money is being spent well.  Alan Beattie
One thing that a lot of campaigners focused on, whether it’s accurate or not, is their perceptions of increasing inequality. Now, you know, at a global level, for a long time that wasn’t necessarily true, but people believed it was true. Within countries, often there was an increase in inequality. What would you think that plays in overall outcomes?  Minouche Shafik
So the perception is often very different than the reality. But the perception matters. You know, I saw a very interesting piece of research which looked at people’s attitudes if they grew up in a period of low growth and social mobility. You tend to have a zero-sum view of the world, and you tend to be less trusting and less willing to see the world in a win-win sort of way. And there is a significant part of the US population which has experienced low growth and low social mobility, because the globalisation that we’ve had in recent decades has given very high rewards to people who are educated, and very low rewards to people who didn’t have a university-level education. And so you can see why there is a backlash, and it reflects a failure of the educational system and the economy to share those opportunities more widely.  Alan Beattie
OK. So let’s talk about what the end point of this is all supposed to be, which is actual development outcomes. People living longer, lower infant mortality, lower maternal mortality, and so forth. Now, despite everything, despite Covid, which is obviously a big setback, overall welfare as measured by human development indicators, it’s on an upward trend that seems to be recovering. Is everything OK despite everything? Can we continue to reduce poverty even without aid?  Minouche Shafik
I think it’s really important to hammer home this point that the so-called development era, which is kind of the world since, let’s say, 1950, the progress that we have made in the world in that period in terms of incomes, poverty reduction, better health, education, nutrition, every single measure of human progress has been more than what was achieved throughout all of human history. It’s just worth dwelling on that for a moment. You know, we’ve had 10 times more progress than in all of human history. People in 1950 used to die in their forties. Now average life expectancy is 71 globally. We’ve got almost every kid in the world into primary school. We’ve achieved gender equality so that every girl, just like every boy, gets access to education. You know, in 1950, half the world’s population was poor. Today it’s less than 10 per cent. So it has been a phenomenal success. Now the question is: was that because of aid? And the problem, as always in economics, you don’t know what the counterfactual is. You can’t rerun the world for the last 75 years and say what would have happened without aid. But what we do know in thousands and thousands of studies that have been done, whether it’s randomised controlled trials or econometric studies or case studies, is that when aid was well-designed, the outcomes were incredibly positive.  Alan Beattie
And how much of this was just technological improvements, particularly in health? You know, one thing I still struggle to get my head around is that my grandmother, who was from a, you know, reasonably well-off background in England, had polio. She was paralysed for two months during the second world war of polio. And then she recovered and then she was fine and so forth. And it’s quite dramatic looking back, even in advanced countries, how measles for children and tuberculosis even, for a long time, persisted. Now those were technological gains, vaccines and so on, which were largely developed in advanced economies. But how much of it was that? How much of it was just 1) it was technological improvements and 2) it was actually rich countries producing stuff that was mainly focused on themselves? You know, one of the first uses of penicillin was for soldiers in the second world war, right?  Minouche Shafik
So definitely technological progress and vaccines played an incredibly important role in reducing infant mortality. Clean water, hugely transformative in terms of increasing life expectancy around the world. And then I think the other thing I’d say is education and getting most kids, at least through primary school, that had huge knock-on benefits in terms of life expectancy, higher incomes, better nutrition and so on. And so those basic things have had huge consequences, I would say.  Alan Beattie
OK, so let’s throw to a break. But when we’re back, I’m going to ask what about developing countries themselves in all of these? What are they thinking? Do they have a collective voice? And above all, what’s the role of China? [MUSIC PLAYING] And we’re back. So there’s this term global south, which aims to take in all low- and middle-income countries. I’m personally not a fan. I’ve made quite a few enemies by not being a fan. And one reason I don’t really like it is there’s this huge amount of differentiation within those countries, and yet there are often some governments, like China and India, which claim to speak on behalf of the global south. You know, India convenes a meeting called the voices of the global south. Is there such a thing as a single developing country, a single emerging market interest?  Minouche Shafik
So I confess, I don’t really like the term myself, and I avoid using it because . . .  Alan Beattie
An ally. I finally have found an ally . . .  Minouche Shafik
Because I mean, different countries are very different from each other. They have different interests. And countries like China, India, South Africa, Brazil, these are middle-income countries with significant and growing power with a significant voice on the global stage. They are members of the G20. They have large economic interests and they have some power. And the second group are kind of small- and medium-sized, low- and middle-income countries who, you know, are making development progress but don’t have significant power on the global stage. And then you have these fragile and conflict-affected countries where most of the poverty is, where the humanitarian crises are and where their governments are very, very weak. The one issue that I think they do have in common is they would all agree that the current international system, as constructed after World War II, doesn’t give them enough voice. And that is the one issue that I think ties them together. What they would do with that voice is probably very different because they have different interests and different agendas.  Alan Beattie
So you mentioned the G20. You know, there’s an institution that has elevated the heads of government level during the global financial crisis. And that was supposed to be the great institution which was going to bring people in. The US, I think, has now said it’s not going to even attend this particular meeting. I think maybe China has not attended some meetings in the past. Has the G20 failed?  Minouche Shafik
So I often describe the G20 like a tea bag. It only works when it’s in hot water. And so it’s been very useful at moments of international crisis. But for routine business it tends to trundle along, not having a lot of impact.  Alan Beattie
And why is that?  Minouche Shafik
Because people in a moment of crisis are forced to co-operate. Whether it was the 2008 financial crisis or even during major conflicts, they have to make compromises to co-operate.  Alan Beattie
So you’re talking about low- and middle-income countries feeling somewhat excluded from structures of governance. Traditionally, of course, that’s absolutely true. You know, it used to be a small gang of countries that stitched up deals in the WTO. Europe in particular is still heavily over-represented on the governing boards of both the World Bank and the IMF where I used to work. Now, this is another subject where I make myself some enemies, which is to point out every time the leadership role from these institutions comes up, the emerging market world completely fails to unite behind sometimes extremely impressive candidates. Why is that?  Minouche Shafik
Yes, I think it often is because the powers that be are very good at divide and rule. And so they manage to create divisions among the developing countries to be able to advance their own agendas. I think that’s the crux of it. Governance reform in these institutions has been on the agenda for decades, and we have made so little progress. It is extremely frustrating. And you know it is true that the biggest problem is mainly Europe who is over-represented. The US is actually not over-represented very much in the boards of these institutions. It’s the Europeans. And unless they find a way to accommodate more developing countries and give them a seat at the table equivalent to their economic importance, the relevance of these institutions will diminish.  Alan Beattie
I mean, there’s a lot of rivalry between the emerging markets. I think someone ran the numbers and said, if you just updated the voting power on the IMF executive board to reflect what’s changed in the global economy, China’s representation would shoot up to something like 17, 18 per cent. India’s would still be three or something per cent. And what someone else has said to me is you won’t have a Chinese president of the World Bank or managing director of International Monetary Fund because India would rather have an American or a European in that role. Similarly, you won’t have an Indian because the Chinese prefer an American over an Indian. So there seems to be this outward solidarity. But in practice, India and China have been to war with each other three times. These countries are rivals and they’re not as much as friends.  Minouche Shafik
Yes, that is true. That is true. And I think the important question, though, is are these institutions truly representative? The issues around who the head is, those kind of things, those are symbolically very important. But in the end, unless you’ve got a shareholding where people feel it reflects the real world, not the world as it was in the middle of the 20th century, they will have less stake in these institutions. And if you lose a large part of the world around that table because they don’t feel that they are being heard, that’s a big loss.  Alan Beattie
In the absence of this, what China in particular has done is set up its own institutions, like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, for example, which some see as a sort of parallel to the World Bank. Is that just because China wants to control institutions? Was it inevitable from that point of view? Or was it genuinely because they felt themselves squeezed out of the World Bank and the IMF? Minouche Shafik
So I think China’s been riding two horses for a while, participating and arguing for more voice in the existing international system, while at the same time creating a parallel system as a kind of plan B. These days, it feels like, because they’re frustrated with progress and because the geopolitical rivalry with the US has grown even more intense, plan B has become plan A, and those parallel institutions have growing memberships and growing resources. They’re still very nascent, and if there was a breakthrough in the existing international system, I think it can be salvaged. But on the current trajectory, we are moving toward parallel systems. Alan Beattie
Now, we’re also moving towards a situation where some of the big emerging markets, better-off emerging markets, are donors rather than aid recipients — India, China, Russia, Saudi and so forth. How is that working? How is the way that they disburse aid and they use aid different from the way that traditional aid donors have done so? Minouche Shafik
Their aid tends to be linked to commercial interests and is often focused on infrastructure rather than, say, human development, health, education and so on. Alan Beattie
And as such, it’s better or worse, do you think, than traditional aid? Minouche Shafik It’s a debate about that. (Alan laughs) It’s very interesting. You know, if you talk to, say, policymakers in Africa, they will sometimes say, well, look, at least it’s tangible. I got a railroad or a football stadium or a highway as a result of that. And the conditionality tends to be more around commercial interests rather than whether your country’s democratic and what your human rights situation is.  So some people think that is better. Others would say it is very, very commercially minded. And so they are getting mining rights or rights to run infrastructure facilities like ports for very, very long-term contracts. Alan Beattie
So from that point of view, what the US is doing in Ukraine is actually sort of coming into line with what China has done for a long time. Minouche Shafik
You could say that. (Laughter) Alan Beattie
I mean, the Chinese programme, in particular the Belt and Road Initiative, and it was huge at one point, around all over southern Africa, and that seems to have pulled back a bit. There seems to be some feeling that even in an autocracy like China, money had been wasted, projects hadn’t worked and it wasn’t wise for them to continue to put their money at risk in that way. Minouche Shafik Well, I do think that some aspects of Belt and Road are being reassessed, in particular the fact that many countries accumulated very large debts as a result of the Belt and Road Initiative, and it put China in the awkward position of being the major creditor to many countries in Africa. And working through the consequences of that has been very difficult.  You know, a country like Zambia has spent the last three years trying to restructure its debt, most of which is to China. And that has been a very difficult process for many African countries and I think also for the Chinese. Having said that, the Chinese have just committed an additional $50bn to Africa over the next few years, so they continue to be very major players. Alan Beattie
China as a creditor is very interesting because one thing they have done is say we are not a traditional creditor, we’re not going to join traditional creditor organisations like the Paris Club of rich countries. We are a developing country ourselves and therefore we can’t be expected to be treated like other creditors. What do you think of that? Do you think that’s something that they’ll have to shift? Minouche Shafik I do think that we need a much better approach for dealing with these huge debt overhangs that are really affecting many countries in Africa. Many, many countries are now spending much more on servicing their debts than they are on health and education domestically, and many of their debts are unsustainable.  China also says these are not official debts. These are commercial debts by our commercial banks to their commercial entities and so there isn’t a real role for the state. But of course, China’s banks ultimately are state-owned, and so the line between what is official and what is private is more complicated. Alan Beattie And here’s the problem with the global south. I mean, another thing that people say about the global south is, oh, it’s not just about income being developing. It’s about their historic experience, their postcolonial experience.  Now, yes, China did obviously have a time of being occupied and controlled by western powers. At the same time, if you ask most Chinese people and if you look at Chinese history, I think they would regard themselves as having been an imperial power rather than a colony. So in a sense, the continuation of ideas like the global south or developing country interest is not very helpful here. Minouche Shafik Yeah. I mean, I think like on many, many international issues, you get coalitions of interest around particular issues at a particular moment in time. And at the moment, there is a very large coalition of developing countries who are highly indebted and whose debt burdens are unsustainable, and they have an interest in getting their debt restructured. And given what’s happening to aid budgets, that will put even more pressure on budgets in poor countries, and they will have to start finding resources to pay for the HIV drugs and the vaccinations and the schoolteachers that were being supported by aid before.  And so this will only make this debt issue more acute and more important for both western, you know, European and Americans, but also the Chinese to solve. It will become the biggest development issue over the next few years. Alan Beattie
OK. So finally, final question: if we could make you supreme dictator of the world . . . (Minouche laughs) If you could wave a wand, and effect just one, but just one big policy change on behalf of all governments in the world, what would it be? Minouche Shafik OK. I’m going to give you one answer, but then I wanna have a thing I could wish for, but I don’t know the answer for. So the one answer, I guess, is that we are entering a very different period demographically and we’ve got ageing populations almost everywhere except Africa, and we need young people of the next generation to be incredibly productive to be able to support these ageing populations.  And so I would want massive investment in early years and the first thousand days of life in health and nutrition, because we know, from very good development experience, that investing in that period massively increases educational attainment and employment opportunities and productivity later in life.  And if we did that across the board and gave every child in the world that really good start, I think that would transform both what’s happening in developing countries — it would help with ageing societies, which is a big problem in the advanced economies — and it would do a huge amount for reducing inequality. That’s the one where I know there’s an answer. Alan Beattie
If the kids are all right, then everyone will be all right. Minouche Shafik Yeah, I think that’s true. The other thing that I lament in the policymaking world globally is the myopia of our politics. You know, if you look across so many domains, you know, that classic Benjamin Franklin quote about an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, it applies in pandemic preparedness, it applies to climate change, it applies to humanitarian crises, it applies to healthcare.  And yet our political systems are unable to make the wise decisions around prevention and investing in prevention because of our political cycles, because of the way we count things fiscally so that the benefits don’t show up, if they don’t show up in a long time, nobody cares at the present. And so if there was a way that we could count things and change the accountability of politicians to get better decision making for the long term, we would be a lot better off. But I don’t have an answer to do that. Alan Beattie
Minouche, thank you for coming in. Thanks very much for your time. Minouche Shafik Pleasure. Thank you, Alan.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Alan Beattie That’s all for this week. You’ve been listening to The Economics Show from the FT. This episode was produced by Laurence Knight with original music from Breen Turner. Our executive producer is Manuela Saragosa. Cheryl Brumley is the FT’s global head of audio. I’m Alan Beattie. Thanks for listening.  [MUSIC PLAYING]",2025-02-27,This is an audio transcript of The Economics Show podcast episode,"In this episode of The Economics Show podcast hosted by Alan Beattie, guest Minouche Shafik discusses the future of aid and development amid changing geopolitical dynamics. The UK government recently announced budget cuts to foreign aid, reducing its aid spending from 0.5% to 0.3% of GDP. Shafik, a highly experienced figure in international development, argues that the landscape of global aid has shifted dramatically, moving towards a view of international relations that emphasizes national self-interest rather than genuine altruism.

Historically, foreign aid was aimed at improving lives in developing countries, but recent trends show a focus on military spending and humanitarian crises rather than long-term development goals. Many aid budgets, notably from Europe and the US, have been declining, while funding from countries like China and India is increasing. This change reflects a broader backlash against globalization and rising domestic needs among wealthier nations.

Shafik emphasizes the importance of quality in aid, criticizing the diversion of funds meant for development to domestic spending like refugee costs. She highlights that while total global aid spending continues to rise, the source and purpose are evolving. Emerging economies are increasingly becoming donors, often linking aid to commercial interests rather than human development.

Despite setbacks and shifts in funding, Shafik remains optimistic about overall global progress in human development, attributing much of it to technological advancements, better healthcare, and education over the past 70 years. She advocates for a renewed focus on investing early in children’s lives, which can lead to better economic outcomes and address issues of inequality, especially in the context of aging populations in developed nations.

The discussion also touches on the effectiveness of institutions like the G20 and the World Bank, with Shafik noting the need for reform to better represent emerging economies and prioritize sustainable development. She concludes by calling for a greater emphasis on preventive measures in policymaking, believing that proactive investments can lead to significant long-term benefits."

Martin Wolf
Donald Trump and his team of trade advisers are approaching a 21st-century problem with 20th-century solutions. Those scornful words were penned by my guest today in an article he wrote in 2017. He was complaining about the US president’s penchant for imposing tariffs on America’s trade partners during his first term in office.

If that’s what he thought back then, I cannot wait to hear what he makes of the newly reinaugurated president’s latest round of import levies, not least because he’s one of the world’s most formidable and most eloquent and knowledgeable experts on international trade and globalisation. But what would be left of either trade or globalisation after four more years of Donald Trump?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

This is The Economics Show. I’m Martin Wolf, the FT’s chief economics commentator. Joining me is Richard E Baldwin down the line from Lausanne in Switzerland, where he’s professor of international economics at the IMD Business School. Richard is also the founder and editor-in-chief of Vox EU, which is a highly prestigious platform where leading European economists share policy analysis. And all these, despite being an American. Richard, welcome to the show.

Richard Baldwin
Happy to be here. Thank you, Martin.

Martin Wolf
Now, before we begin, I should mention that I think, uniquely among my friends who are leading international trade economists, your father was also an international trade economist. Indeed, one of enormous stature and influence. So I’ve always wondered, why did you decide to follow in your father’s really rather large footsteps?

Richard Baldwin
Yes. Well, my father was helping the US prepare for the Kennedy Round when I was in kindergarten. He was in the Kennedy Camelot administration, and I think I saw him travel all over the world. And our dinner table conversations were like a seminar or so. I knew all the terms and how to debate. And then when I got to university, I wanted to be a lawyer, but I found that I could get A’s in economics without studying. So I majored in economics. And then it turned out that I actually liked economics, and since I preferred micro to macro, and since my dad travelled so much, it had to be international. So I did international trade. It’s as easy as that. Although I think maybe a psychiatrist would find a much cleaner route between my father being a professor of international trade and me being a professor of international trade.

Martin Wolf
Well, it’s certainly a remarkable curriculum vitae, and I must say, very good for us, because you’ve done a wonderful job in recent years, indeed over many years, in explaining what is going on in world trade and contradicting a lot of conventional wisdom. So let’s start with this or the big picture, which is what’s actually happening to globalisation over the last few decades. Is there any truth in the conventional explanation that the financial crisis of 2007-09 just broke all the trends, and that’s why trade has been growing more slowly? What’s really been going on?

Richard Baldwin
Well, the assertion that you’re talking about is peak globalisation, that globalisation kind of soared up from the late ‘80s, early ‘90s to 2008. And then if you look at just the statistics, it falls after that at the world level. Now I like to call that a false peak because it’s a concatenation of China, which started falling well before 2008, and the other G7 countries, which started falling after 2008. So it’s a false peak, but it reflects a reality that globalisation is not growing as fast as it did in the 1990s.

So I interpret that as a phase transition. What we had was a brand-new type of globalisation opened up in the late ‘80s, early ‘90s, where we had offshoring and outsourcing of manufacturing, and that led to a rapid growth in two-way trade of parts and components in addition to final goods. And we reached kind of a plateau for that. A lot of that had to do with moving manufacturing to China. And that shift, although it’s continued, has been overwhelmed by China’s GDP growth, which has been even faster than its export growth. So China’s export to GDP ratio is falling. And since China’s so now important in the world economy, it’s dragging down the world peak as well.

Martin Wolf
This is obviously very important. And I’d like if you introduce as an intellectual framework your sort of notion of the three phases of world trade over the last couple of centuries. And this one, I think, is the second of your three.

Richard Baldwin
That’s right. So I wrote a book called The Great Convergence.

Martin Wolf
Wonderful book, which I cited in columns, a wonderful book.

Richard Baldwin
Absolutely. Thank you very much. I spend about 300 pages trying to explain what I meant to say. In one of your columns, you said there’s three phases: goods crossing borders; factory crossing borders; and the third one which we’re in now is offices crossing borders. So you’re exactly right. This idea of the back and forth trade in parts and components, exploding the export to output ratio in transition, is exactly what I was talking about. So I like to call it the second unbundling where factories started crossing borders in a big way.

Martin Wolf
Well, we’re going to move later to this third stage, which I think is immensely important. But let’s talk a bit more about this second stage before we start thinking about what Donald Trump might do to it. Is your basic view that factories, as it were, moved across borders basically as far as they could? We’ve done that. We’ve exploited the opportunity. Now we’re moving on.

Richard Baldwin
I think that’s exactly right. So the big trigger was information and communication technology. And that made it feasible to organise production of complex products, where, for example, you’re producing the tail of a Canadian Bombardier jet in central Mexico and the rest of it in Quebec. And the organisation is so good, you could put those together and make a plane, and it would fly. Before the internet, before email, before widespread cell phones, that kind of co-ordination was just not possible. So the way I think about it is what is happening is there’s been an arbitrage on labour cost, and that arbitrage was enabled by ICT, which allowed the co-ordination of having one stage of production, say, in Mexico and another stage in, say, the United States. And that arbitrage on labour cost didn’t apply to every single stage of production, because not every state uses the stuff where Mexican labour is cheapest. And so what we have got is most of the stuff that should be outsourced has been outsourced. So it looks like globalisation has plateaued. But the way I think of that is you were at one equilibrium in the ‘70s and ‘80s, then you jumped up in the ‘90s, 2000s, 2010s maybe, and then you’ve reached another one. What was unusual was the rapid rise, not the fact that it’s plateaued or is falling now.

Martin Wolf
So I suppose one of the reasons this has slowed is, as you said, a big part of it was labour cost arbitrage, as economists would say in their usual elegant way. And the big arbitrage, inevitably, was the opening of the Chinese economy in this vast quantity of cheap and hardworking labour. And the Chinese labour has got more expensive. And so that opportunity necessarily isn’t what it was. And that’s exactly what we all hoped would happen when the opening occurred.

Richard Baldwin
Exactly. That’s the way it’s supposed to work. And the Japanese call it the flying geese pattern, where back in the day it was Japan who was the lead goose. And as their wages and technology rose, they offshored things like lower unskilled labour, you know, furniture and textiles to the four dragons there: Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Korea. And then to the next four, etc. And now China’s doing exactly the same thing. China’s becoming a headquarter economy and are offshoring stages of production to countries with lower costs of unskilled labour.

But let me make one point, Martin, which I kind of forgot about, and that the other aspect of this, which is truly revolutionary, is the ICT has allowed G7 firms, manufacturing firms, to take their own manufacturing technology and combine it with low-cost labour abroad. And that was a huge change in the nature of globalisation. So that big arbitrage, the second one, is that the manufacturing technology, which used to be heavily concentrated in G7 countries, owned by the firms in those countries, has now moved to nearby emerging markets, above all China, and sparked an industrialisation take-off, in which they are now inventing their own technology. And that one-time switch is not going back. But it did lead also feeding into this very rapid shift of manufacturing from the G7 countries to a handful of emerging countries, above all, China.

Martin Wolf
And I suppose if we’re looking at the world today, you can see countries like Vietnam trying to pursue a similar strategy in the wild geese formation. But of course, compared to China, Vietnam is pretty small. So China clearly is going to have had historically the biggest impact in this way that any country is likely ever to have.

Richard Baldwin
Absolutely. China now accounts for 35 per cent of the gross production of manufacturing in the whole world, and Chinese gross production is now larger than the next nine countries put together. So if you take the entire G7 plus Korea and India, China’s output in gross terms is higher. In value-added terms, it’s almost as high. China is the world’s sole superpower in manufacturing, and a lot of what they export is intermediate inputs into the production processes of other countries, including the United States. So in some sense, the world has become linked, with a dependence on Chinese manufacturing, which will be very, very difficult to change.

Martin Wolf
There is, of course, an argument that what went on in China and between China and western firms wasn’t at all as benign as you describe it. It wasn’t just western and Japanese firms going to produce in China because there was cheap labour. But China from various means stole the know-how that you describe as the basis of what was going on. The western and Japanese firms’ know-how was what made Chinese labour so effective and valuable. And then the Chinese basically stole it.

And in addition, there is the argument that they pursued a policy of deliberate undervaluation of the exchange rate. So this wasn’t really a natural economic process at all. It was a predatory set of policies, and we are absolutely right to stop them.

Richard Baldwin
But let me put a little perspective on that. So first of all, if you go back in history, China was one of the largest manufacturing countries in the world. In the early parts of the 1800s, the output of China in manufacturing was larger than the UK, for example, partly because it’s so large. And so what we had was a deindustrialisation of China during the long 19th century when British manufacturing went up, and then American and then German and France. China was then pushed into a situation, at least in part, by colonial wars, where they were forced to open themselves to foreign manufacturing, having themselves decided to close off in the Ming dynasty. So in some sense, especially in China, they view this as setting the clock back to the correct hour, where China was a large player in the world market. So let me just get that right.

And second, is because I think the word “stole” is probably appropriate in a few things, but the vast majority of China’s productivity advance is a much more tacit knowledge about how to organise things, how to manage things. And so I think when Japanese, American and German companies went to China, they were hoping to keep their proprietary technology to themselves. And by hook or by crook, some of that leaked out. But a lot of the spillover wasn’t really in like a blueprint or a patent or industrial secret. A lot of it was just how do you organise manufacturing and how do you train managers, how do you train workers? And that knowledge seeped over into the general economy as the G7 companies actually trained managers, local managers and trained workers. And then they started to be hired by Chinese. So I think the vast majority of it is really just a general knowledge of how you do manufacturing and the organisational aspects it spilled over. The second thing is China is a planned economy and undervaluation of the exchange rate for a very long time was an important part of that. So I agree with . . . This was directed by China. But on the other hand, you have to say that the loss of manufacturing from the G7, especially the US, was due to a lack of a plan. One of the quips I like is that if you don’t have an industrial policy, then you’re following China’s industrial policy.

Martin Wolf
I guess that’s a nice comment. Well, I agree with most of that. And I pointed out in one of my columns quite a long time ago that the US started stealing intellectual property from Britain, more or less as soon as the Industrial Revolution started. So what are they complaining about? As it were, this is all part of history. But now we have a president who does have a plan. Well, it’s sort of a plan. He thinks that by using tariffs that he is going to rectify all this. Is he right?

Richard Baldwin
No, I think it’s absolutely . . . He is not understanding the modern economy. I don’t know when he first read about tariffs, but surely it was when the world was a simpler place before all these global supply chains got put up.

So let me just give you an example. He put 10 per cent tariff on all Chinese inputs. And what that means is, since about 40 per cent of China exports to the United States are in intermediate goods, which are used by American-based companies to produce other stuff. So now what he’s done is made those inputs 10 per cent more expensive if you make it in the US, but not more expensive if you make it in Canada or Mexico. So this idea that putting tariffs on China will move industry to the United States might have worked in the old world, where the United States was making cars almost entirely in the United States. But now, since American cars are made with parts and components from all over the place, including China, and then putting a tax on it, makes the location of other countries higher. And so he’s just relatively ill-informed.

The second point is that the US doesn’t have the workers willing to work in factories with sufficient skills to ramp up industrial production in the United States by a substantial amount. But what Biden did, which was a little bit more informed, I think, by economic reasoning, was he decided that certain products like, say, semiconductors, advanced AI, advanced chips, those should be made in the United States, at least in part for national security reasons. And he targeted those industries and had conscious policies to bring more of that production to the United States. Trump’s approach really is just ill-informed about the modern realities of the global supply chain and international trade.

Martin Wolf
It rather reminds me of the debates that I was engaged in, well, a very long time ago when I worked on developing countries, because the arguments that Trump has been making, basically very similar to the arguments people in India and Brazil, big economies, made that if we have high tariffs, then we’re going to create the whole industrial chain from beginning to end within our country, and we are quite big enough to do that. Now, obviously, the US is bigger than they were, but in practice in quite a few industries, the US market is by no means the dominant market of the world. One of the comments I made in one of my columns is that if you look at electric vehicles, for example, the Chinese market is more than twice the size of the American market. So this Trumpian view of the self-sufficient import-substituting economy, as we would call, is a really foolish throwback because the US isn’t big enough to be competitive in all these industries if it shifts everything in this way inside the borders.

Richard Baldwin
Yes, I agree with that. And no country, not Germany, not Japan, not China makes everything themselves. We’re in a world where to be competitive in the final product, you have to source your parts and components from the most competitive sources. And given scale economies, no one economy’s big enough to do that whole thing.

Another aspect of the US size is I think President Trump is totally overestimating the leverage he has over the entire world. So US imports are only about 11 per cent of world imports overall, and the US economy is only about 25 per cent of the world economy, so it’s not like it was in the old days when he was a young man, where the US dominated the world economy, and I think he still has that in mind.

So I think President Trump has found himself in a presidential promise pickle with tariffs. If he puts it on final goods, it’ll show up in the aisles of Walmart, especially on China. In other words, the price that the Maga base pays for the stuff they buy in Walmart will be much higher. And that is something he promised wouldn’t happen. He promised, actually, he would lower prices.

If he puts the tariff on intermediate goods, but not final goods, which was a lot of what he did in his last administration, then he’s crippling the competitiveness of American manufacturing since in Mexico and Canada, they don’t face these kinds of tariffs or Europe or Japan. So that would break another promise, which is to reinvigorate US manufacturing. So he’s stuck. And I think that’s part of the reason he’s been very hesitant to actually go ahead with all the threats he’s made.

Martin Wolf
So if the rest of the world looks at this extraordinary performance that we are seeing by Donald Trump — but mostly it’s a performance, smoke and mirrors sort of thing — would it be the best thing to just sort of ignore it? Or should they retaliate? What would you advise the Europeans, the rest of the world, to do? Should they take this really seriously? Or actually say he’s not going to destroy world trade, it’s not big enough, it’s not important enough. The US market even is not that important. We’re just going to go on trade with one another. Behave like grown-ups. And at some point, the Americans will come to their senses.

Richard Baldwin
OK, so let me take that in three batches. So the classic is that you have to retaliate when people do unfair, unusual things in trade. That is the basis even of the World Trade Organization system. For instance, if you subsidise your exports, I put on a duty against your exports — countervailing duties. That retaliation is the core of what maintains the peace, to start with.

Now, what the Chinese did in the Trump first administration is they retaliated, but always a little bit less than he did. And so it was a de-escalatory kind of retaliation. But if nothing else, it allowed them to hold their heads high in front of their citizens and saying, we’re not being bullied by this guy. So that’s the classic take is to retaliate. And I think basically every country has to go that way because this is a man who does not respect weakness.

The second part of it is, I think you got to realise that what this guy wants is to look good. And so I think, for instance, in Mexico and Canada, when Trump threatened them with 25 per cent tariffs, which was not credible, they gave some visuals that made it look like Trump won, but essentially things they were doing already and they were recast as a big win for the negotiations. And you can see an element of this because when Trump negotiates, he’s very vague about what the negotiations are about. He muddies the water. So at any point he can declare victory and say, see, they made a concession. But the important part there is not to make him look like a fool and to go along with the face-saving at the end of the whole thing. And I think a lot of foreign leaders have figured this out. And there’s also, you know, venal things, like helping his family with deals around the world, for instance.

So the third take on it, is I think what we got to do is stop viewing Trump as playing a standard game of international relations power. You know, give and take, retaliation, threats, mutually assured destruction. And realise what he’s playing is what we call the mad-dog strategy. And that is you come across the street and there’s this mad dog, absolutely wild, so wild it may be that the dog engages in things that are bad for him, and so you can’t predict what they’re going to do by looking at their self-interest. The dog could run across the street despite the traffic, and then bite you just because it’s a mad dog.

Now, the strategy for a mad dog is to be calm and not concede to whatever he wants. And in this case, if Trump gets one thing from the Europeans, he’s going to want another thing from the Europeans. So you can’t give in to the mad-dog strategy.

The key there is to realise he really isn’t mad, and he has the political constraint of keeping his base happy, which means not really putting on tariffs too much. He has the political constraint of not really disrupting American manufacturing by raising the cost of imported intermediates in the US, making the US a high-cost island. So I put all those three things together, and I think to a certain extent, the way especially the Mexican president played it, was very careful. She was harsh to start with in claiming that sovereignty, national pride, retaliation, etc. And then at the end, made some face-saving concessions that Trump could then say, look, I won this. I forced them into these concessions, even though they weren’t very big concessions.

Martin Wolf
Thank you very much. I think that’s a very good overview. So we’re going to take a break now. And when we get back, I’m going to ask Richard about the one area of trade that is still growing really rapidly. And yet it is often overlooked because, as economists like to say, it is invisible.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

We’re back from the break, and now we’re going to be talking about invisibles, the extraordinary growth of trade in things that we used not to measure.

Richard Baldwin
Martin, do you know where that ‘invisible’ term came from?

Martin Wolf
No.

Richard Baldwin
So in the old days of fixed exchange rates, foreign exchange had to go through the official accounts, right? That was the way it was. And foreign exchange would show up in the Treasury account and they’d go like, what the hell is this? And, well, it’s invisible trade.

Martin Wolf
Yes.

Richard Baldwin
Because it didn’t . . . the customs data . . . 

Martin Wolf
Because there were no customs data. Yes.

Richard Baldwin
Right. They called it trade in invisibles because, you know, they didn’t know where it was.

Martin Wolf
Wonderful. I didn’t know that. Now, how important, if at all, are tariffs on goods when the fastest growth in trade is in services and particularly digital services. And tariffs have really nothing to do with that at all. You can’t use a tariff to stop that. So are we just as Trump is fixated with the past, the really deep past, most analysts are also fixated with what is really the past and not the present and future of world trade.

Richard Baldwin
Yes, I think that’s absolutely true. And I would make a couple comments. One is China is making a mistake by focusing so much on manufacturing, when all the good jobs in the future economy are going to be in sophisticated services. So that’s point one.

But the second thing is about it’s not just its services are growing faster than goods trade. I think there’s a systemic, long-term technological reason why trade, especially in manufactured goods, is declining. And that’s got to do with the automation of manufacturing. So the real reason it’s more cost-effective to produce things in China or Vietnam or Mexico is because the cost of labour. But as automation takes the labour out of manufacturing, then the incentive to make it far away diminishes. And on the services side, the technology is moving exactly the opposite way. The wage differences between skilled service sector workers across countries is enormous. Something like, you know, over 1,000 per cent differences. And as digital technology makes it easier for us to work from home, we will see more of this arbitrage where offices in high-wage, rich countries start to use more and more professionals, highly qualified, skilled people located in developing countries or emerging markets, high-education, low-wage emerging markets. So that’s where I think we are.

The second thing you said was about tariffs. And that I think is really interesting. All the discussion about geopolitics, the vast majority of it is US-China in manufactured goods. There is tiny bits in services like TikTok or the services in electric vehicles in the United States and things like that. But as you pointed out, it’s basically impossible to put a tariff on a service that crosses borders because it doesn’t go through customs. In fact, it’s often not recorded. One of the most remarkable things about services statistics is that they’re terrible, because it’s hard to gather statistics on, for example, when if an American consulting firm hires somebody in Poland to fix up their PowerPoint slides and then brings it back. In principle, that’s trade. But you can be almost positive that that did not enter into US trade in services statistics. And the reasons why it’s hard to gather statistics are exactly the reason it’s hard to put on tariffs. It’s hard to know how much they’re worth. No country has really figured out how to put tariffs on trade in services, and I think it’s a technological thing.

Now let me do a slight side, because if you talk to most analysts, they’ll tell you that trade in services is incredibly protected. There’s even something called the OECD Services Trade Restrictiveness Index, which shows enormous barriers in trade in services. But here’s the key: those barriers affect B2C, business to consumer. So for example, architectural services. If you want to hire an architect to design a house or a building, that’s from B2C and it’s incredibly heavily regulated. Same for medicine, law, accounting, all sorts of things like that.

But if it’s B2B, for instance, if the architect who’s based in America and accredited in America wants to hire an Indian architect to design, say, the stairwell blocks, there is no barrier on that. So the idea is that this explosion is in intermediate services or B2B services, not in final services. So what we’re seeing is an explosion of global service value chains now, like we saw in the 1990s with manufacturing. And that’s where your wonderful phrase was, I use all the time now, that we have offices crossing borders, not just factories and goods. In other words, people organising remote teams that include low-cost, high-quality foreign workers in the supply chain. And by the way, I just would note that that’s what we’re doing now since I’m in Switzerland and you’re in the UK. I’m actually exporting services to the UK, but I’m pretty sure it won’t show up either in the Swiss statistics or in the UK statistics. Of course, none of us are getting paid for this, so maybe it shouldn’t. But that’s the kind of example. Think about how difficult it would be to tax the transmission we’re doing right now. Making the recording with a tariff, it would be almost impossible.

These are very important points I’ve been arguing for quite a long time, actually. That is very, very clear from the data that manufacturing is going the way of agriculture, which is that essentially we feed ourselves across the world astoundingly well with a tiny fraction of the labour force in farming that we used to have 100 years, or 200 years ago, because productivity in agriculture has completely transformed. It’s not very difficult to imagine a world, and it may not be very far away in which in factories everywhere, there won’t be any workers. I mean, essentially it’s all going to be done by robots of various kinds, because robots are so good at this. So this idea that we’re going to recreate huge labour forces in manufacturing is completely undermined by the most fundamental technological changes of our time.

There is a security reason, perhaps, for having semiconductors made in the United States, but we’re never going to have a million people making chips. We’re going to have machines making chips. But there is an argument that the labour arbitrage in services that you mention could be undermined really rather dramatically by artificial intelligence. Let me give you an example which I’ve actually come across. You could send X-ray images to India and you would get Indian radiologists to look at these. Much, much cheaper than American radiologists, perfectly well trained and they would tell you what they’d seen. But now AI is really good at pattern recognition, better than humans and probably will get better and better. And therefore there is an alternative for your American firm. They’re just going to have it done at home by a computer. Now of course, that means the employment goes anyway, so it doesn’t make any difference to all the people in our jobs with high skills, which are being reduced in value very dramatically. But it would have a different impact on trade, wouldn’t it?

Richard Baldwin
Yes. So I’ve written an article published last year which looks at the globotics quadrant. So we take on the vertical axis the degree of automatability of a particular profession. And on the horizontal axis we put the teleworkability of the occupation, and then we plot all the US occupations. And the ones up here in the north-east are both highly automatable and highly offshoreable, so to speak. And that’s where your substitutions come in. But there are other quadrants where it’s offshoreable, but not automatable; where it’s neither; where it’s automatable, but not offshoreable. There’s jobs in all four quadrants. And the point that remote intelligence and artificial intelligence are substitutes is true, but only for some jobs.

So the classic example is in chatbots versus call centres. So call centres employment is going down in places like the Philippines and India because chatbots are taking over a lot of it. But there are other things where AI is making the foreign workers even more competitive. And a paper that we just published, we found that GenAI made South African workers better substitutes for Americans when both were using GenAI. And then afterwards, we asked American-based online people to guess whether the work product that they did was done by an American or by a South African. And when they were using GenAI, it was random. They could not identify who was South African, which indicated that GenAI is actually making foreign workers better substitutes because not only does it affect their productivity, it also allows them to be more culturally adapted to their audience. GenAI is fluent in cultural differences and nuances, so they’re not writing in South African English. They’re writing in American English when they use the GenAI. So I think it cuts both ways. But certainly there are occupations where AI is going to undermine international trade in services, but there are other ones where it’s actually going to amplify it. And I think on the whole, GenAI will make foreign workers better substitutes for workers in rich countries.

Martin Wolf
I think the big conclusion here is that our politics are focusing on jobs in manufacturing, which is sort of ancient history. But what is really going to come our way, and that I’ve got this from much of your writing, is a huge upheaval in jobs, in services, and particularly in relatively sophisticated jobs. And that will affect the middle and upper-middle classes of our societies, and the politics of that are really going to be something.

Richard Baldwin
Well, that’s absolutely true. Service and professional workers are facing pressures from globalisation, direct wage competition and automation threatening their jobs. So just as automation and globalisation threaten manufacturing jobs and led to a backlash in manufacturing sectors, I think that’s coming to the service sector. So I couldn’t agree more.

Martin Wolf
So thank you very much. We’ve had a wonderful overview of what’s been happening to trade. What is happening to trade now with Donald Trump and what is likely to happen to trade, because the revolutions we have been seeing in the last 30, 40 years, particularly within manufacturing, are now coming to services. Richard Baldwin, thank you very much.

Richard Baldwin
My pleasure. Any time.

Donald Trump and his team of trade advisers are approaching a 21st-century problem with 20th-century solutions. Those scornful words were penned by my guest today in an article he wrote in 2017. He was complaining about the US president’s penchant for imposing tariffs on America’s trade partners during his first term in office. If that’s what he thought back then, I cannot wait to hear what he makes of the newly reinaugurated president’s latest round of import levies, not least because he’s one of the world’s most formidable and most eloquent and knowledgeable experts on international trade and globalisation. But what would be left of either trade or globalisation after four more years of Donald Trump?  [MUSIC PLAYING] This is The Economics Show. I’m Martin Wolf, the FT’s chief economics commentator. Joining me is Richard E Baldwin down the line from Lausanne in Switzerland, where he’s professor of international economics at the IMD Business School. Richard is also the founder and editor-in-chief of Vox EU, which is a highly prestigious platform where leading European economists share policy analysis. And all these, despite being an American. Richard, welcome to the show. Richard Baldwin
Happy to be here. Thank you, Martin. Martin Wolf
Now, before we begin, I should mention that I think, uniquely among my friends who are leading international trade economists, your father was also an international trade economist. Indeed, one of enormous stature and influence. So I’ve always wondered, why did you decide to follow in your father’s really rather large footsteps? Richard Baldwin
Yes. Well, my father was helping the US prepare for the Kennedy Round when I was in kindergarten. He was in the Kennedy Camelot administration, and I think I saw him travel all over the world. And our dinner table conversations were like a seminar or so. I knew all the terms and how to debate. And then when I got to university, I wanted to be a lawyer, but I found that I could get A’s in economics without studying. So I majored in economics. And then it turned out that I actually liked economics, and since I preferred micro to macro, and since my dad travelled so much, it had to be international. So I did international trade. It’s as easy as that. Although I think maybe a psychiatrist would find a much cleaner route between my father being a professor of international trade and me being a professor of international trade. Martin Wolf
Well, it’s certainly a remarkable curriculum vitae, and I must say, very good for us, because you’ve done a wonderful job in recent years, indeed over many years, in explaining what is going on in world trade and contradicting a lot of conventional wisdom. So let’s start with this or the big picture, which is what’s actually happening to globalisation over the last few decades. Is there any truth in the conventional explanation that the financial crisis of 2007-09 just broke all the trends, and that’s why trade has been growing more slowly? What’s really been going on? Richard Baldwin
Well, the assertion that you’re talking about is peak globalisation, that globalisation kind of soared up from the late ‘80s, early ‘90s to 2008. And then if you look at just the statistics, it falls after that at the world level. Now I like to call that a false peak because it’s a concatenation of China, which started falling well before 2008, and the other G7 countries, which started falling after 2008. So it’s a false peak, but it reflects a reality that globalisation is not growing as fast as it did in the 1990s. So I interpret that as a phase transition. What we had was a brand-new type of globalisation opened up in the late ‘80s, early ‘90s, where we had offshoring and outsourcing of manufacturing, and that led to a rapid growth in two-way trade of parts and components in addition to final goods. And we reached kind of a plateau for that. A lot of that had to do with moving manufacturing to China. And that shift, although it’s continued, has been overwhelmed by China’s GDP growth, which has been even faster than its export growth. So China’s export to GDP ratio is falling. And since China’s so now important in the world economy, it’s dragging down the world peak as well. Martin Wolf
This is obviously very important. And I’d like if you introduce as an intellectual framework your sort of notion of the three phases of world trade over the last couple of centuries. And this one, I think, is the second of your three. Richard Baldwin
That’s right. So I wrote a book called The Great Convergence. Martin Wolf
Wonderful book, which I cited in columns, a wonderful book. Richard Baldwin
Absolutely. Thank you very much. I spend about 300 pages trying to explain what I meant to say. In one of your columns, you said there’s three phases: goods crossing borders; factory crossing borders; and the third one which we’re in now is offices crossing borders. So you’re exactly right. This idea of the back and forth trade in parts and components, exploding the export to output ratio in transition, is exactly what I was talking about. So I like to call it the second unbundling where factories started crossing borders in a big way. Martin Wolf
Well, we’re going to move later to this third stage, which I think is immensely important. But let’s talk a bit more about this second stage before we start thinking about what Donald Trump might do to it. Is your basic view that factories, as it were, moved across borders basically as far as they could? We’ve done that. We’ve exploited the opportunity. Now we’re moving on. Richard Baldwin
I think that’s exactly right. So the big trigger was information and communication technology. And that made it feasible to organise production of complex products, where, for example, you’re producing the tail of a Canadian Bombardier jet in central Mexico and the rest of it in Quebec. And the organisation is so good, you could put those together and make a plane, and it would fly. Before the internet, before email, before widespread cell phones, that kind of co-ordination was just not possible. So the way I think about it is what is happening is there’s been an arbitrage on labour cost, and that arbitrage was enabled by ICT, which allowed the co-ordination of having one stage of production, say, in Mexico and another stage in, say, the United States. And that arbitrage on labour cost didn’t apply to every single stage of production, because not every state uses the stuff where Mexican labour is cheapest. And so what we have got is most of the stuff that should be outsourced has been outsourced. So it looks like globalisation has plateaued. But the way I think of that is you were at one equilibrium in the ‘70s and ‘80s, then you jumped up in the ‘90s, 2000s, 2010s maybe, and then you’ve reached another one. What was unusual was the rapid rise, not the fact that it’s plateaued or is falling now. Martin Wolf
So I suppose one of the reasons this has slowed is, as you said, a big part of it was labour cost arbitrage, as economists would say in their usual elegant way. And the big arbitrage, inevitably, was the opening of the Chinese economy in this vast quantity of cheap and hardworking labour. And the Chinese labour has got more expensive. And so that opportunity necessarily isn’t what it was. And that’s exactly what we all hoped would happen when the opening occurred. Richard Baldwin
Exactly. That’s the way it’s supposed to work. And the Japanese call it the flying geese pattern, where back in the day it was Japan who was the lead goose. And as their wages and technology rose, they offshored things like lower unskilled labour, you know, furniture and textiles to the four dragons there: Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Korea. And then to the next four, etc. And now China’s doing exactly the same thing. China’s becoming a headquarter economy and are offshoring stages of production to countries with lower costs of unskilled labour. But let me make one point, Martin, which I kind of forgot about, and that the other aspect of this, which is truly revolutionary, is the ICT has allowed G7 firms, manufacturing firms, to take their own manufacturing technology and combine it with low-cost labour abroad. And that was a huge change in the nature of globalisation. So that big arbitrage, the second one, is that the manufacturing technology, which used to be heavily concentrated in G7 countries, owned by the firms in those countries, has now moved to nearby emerging markets, above all China, and sparked an industrialisation take-off, in which they are now inventing their own technology. And that one-time switch is not going back. But it did lead also feeding into this very rapid shift of manufacturing from the G7 countries to a handful of emerging countries, above all, China. Martin Wolf
And I suppose if we’re looking at the world today, you can see countries like Vietnam trying to pursue a similar strategy in the wild geese formation. But of course, compared to China, Vietnam is pretty small. So China clearly is going to have had historically the biggest impact in this way that any country is likely ever to have. Richard Baldwin
Absolutely. China now accounts for 35 per cent of the gross production of manufacturing in the whole world, and Chinese gross production is now larger than the next nine countries put together. So if you take the entire G7 plus Korea and India, China’s output in gross terms is higher. In value-added terms, it’s almost as high. China is the world’s sole superpower in manufacturing, and a lot of what they export is intermediate inputs into the production processes of other countries, including the United States. So in some sense, the world has become linked, with a dependence on Chinese manufacturing, which will be very, very difficult to change. Martin Wolf
There is, of course, an argument that what went on in China and between China and western firms wasn’t at all as benign as you describe it. It wasn’t just western and Japanese firms going to produce in China because there was cheap labour. But China from various means stole the know-how that you describe as the basis of what was going on. The western and Japanese firms’ know-how was what made Chinese labour so effective and valuable. And then the Chinese basically stole it. And in addition, there is the argument that they pursued a policy of deliberate undervaluation of the exchange rate. So this wasn’t really a natural economic process at all. It was a predatory set of policies, and we are absolutely right to stop them. Richard Baldwin
But let me put a little perspective on that. So first of all, if you go back in history, China was one of the largest manufacturing countries in the world. In the early parts of the 1800s, the output of China in manufacturing was larger than the UK, for example, partly because it’s so large. And so what we had was a deindustrialisation of China during the long 19th century when British manufacturing went up, and then American and then German and France. China was then pushed into a situation, at least in part, by colonial wars, where they were forced to open themselves to foreign manufacturing, having themselves decided to close off in the Ming dynasty. So in some sense, especially in China, they view this as setting the clock back to the correct hour, where China was a large player in the world market. So let me just get that right. And second, is because I think the word “stole” is probably appropriate in a few things, but the vast majority of China’s productivity advance is a much more tacit knowledge about how to organise things, how to manage things. And so I think when Japanese, American and German companies went to China, they were hoping to keep their proprietary technology to themselves. And by hook or by crook, some of that leaked out. But a lot of the spillover wasn’t really in like a blueprint or a patent or industrial secret. A lot of it was just how do you organise manufacturing and how do you train managers, how do you train workers? And that knowledge seeped over into the general economy as the G7 companies actually trained managers, local managers and trained workers. And then they started to be hired by Chinese. So I think the vast majority of it is really just a general knowledge of how you do manufacturing and the organisational aspects it spilled over. The second thing is China is a planned economy and undervaluation of the exchange rate for a very long time was an important part of that. So I agree with . . . This was directed by China. But on the other hand, you have to say that the loss of manufacturing from the G7, especially the US, was due to a lack of a plan. One of the quips I like is that if you don’t have an industrial policy, then you’re following China’s industrial policy. Martin Wolf
I guess that’s a nice comment. Well, I agree with most of that. And I pointed out in one of my columns quite a long time ago that the US started stealing intellectual property from Britain, more or less as soon as the Industrial Revolution started. So what are they complaining about? As it were, this is all part of history. But now we have a president who does have a plan. Well, it’s sort of a plan. He thinks that by using tariffs that he is going to rectify all this. Is he right? Richard Baldwin
No, I think it’s absolutely . . . He is not understanding the modern economy. I don’t know when he first read about tariffs, but surely it was when the world was a simpler place before all these global supply chains got put up. So let me just give you an example. He put 10 per cent tariff on all Chinese inputs. And what that means is, since about 40 per cent of China exports to the United States are in intermediate goods, which are used by American-based companies to produce other stuff. So now what he’s done is made those inputs 10 per cent more expensive if you make it in the US, but not more expensive if you make it in Canada or Mexico. So this idea that putting tariffs on China will move industry to the United States might have worked in the old world, where the United States was making cars almost entirely in the United States. But now, since American cars are made with parts and components from all over the place, including China, and then putting a tax on it, makes the location of other countries higher. And so he’s just relatively ill-informed. The second point is that the US doesn’t have the workers willing to work in factories with sufficient skills to ramp up industrial production in the United States by a substantial amount. But what Biden did, which was a little bit more informed, I think, by economic reasoning, was he decided that certain products like, say, semiconductors, advanced AI, advanced chips, those should be made in the United States, at least in part for national security reasons. And he targeted those industries and had conscious policies to bring more of that production to the United States. Trump’s approach really is just ill-informed about the modern realities of the global supply chain and international trade. Martin Wolf
It rather reminds me of the debates that I was engaged in, well, a very long time ago when I worked on developing countries, because the arguments that Trump has been making, basically very similar to the arguments people in India and Brazil, big economies, made that if we have high tariffs, then we’re going to create the whole industrial chain from beginning to end within our country, and we are quite big enough to do that. Now, obviously, the US is bigger than they were, but in practice in quite a few industries, the US market is by no means the dominant market of the world. One of the comments I made in one of my columns is that if you look at electric vehicles, for example, the Chinese market is more than twice the size of the American market. So this Trumpian view of the self-sufficient import-substituting economy, as we would call, is a really foolish throwback because the US isn’t big enough to be competitive in all these industries if it shifts everything in this way inside the borders. Richard Baldwin
Yes, I agree with that. And no country, not Germany, not Japan, not China makes everything themselves. We’re in a world where to be competitive in the final product, you have to source your parts and components from the most competitive sources. And given scale economies, no one economy’s big enough to do that whole thing. Another aspect of the US size is I think President Trump is totally overestimating the leverage he has over the entire world. So US imports are only about 11 per cent of world imports overall, and the US economy is only about 25 per cent of the world economy, so it’s not like it was in the old days when he was a young man, where the US dominated the world economy, and I think he still has that in mind. So I think President Trump has found himself in a presidential promise pickle with tariffs. If he puts it on final goods, it’ll show up in the aisles of Walmart, especially on China. In other words, the price that the Maga base pays for the stuff they buy in Walmart will be much higher. And that is something he promised wouldn’t happen. He promised, actually, he would lower prices. If he puts the tariff on intermediate goods, but not final goods, which was a lot of what he did in his last administration, then he’s crippling the competitiveness of American manufacturing since in Mexico and Canada, they don’t face these kinds of tariffs or Europe or Japan. So that would break another promise, which is to reinvigorate US manufacturing. So he’s stuck. And I think that’s part of the reason he’s been very hesitant to actually go ahead with all the threats he’s made. Martin Wolf
So if the rest of the world looks at this extraordinary performance that we are seeing by Donald Trump — but mostly it’s a performance, smoke and mirrors sort of thing — would it be the best thing to just sort of ignore it? Or should they retaliate? What would you advise the Europeans, the rest of the world, to do? Should they take this really seriously? Or actually say he’s not going to destroy world trade, it’s not big enough, it’s not important enough. The US market even is not that important. We’re just going to go on trade with one another. Behave like grown-ups. And at some point, the Americans will come to their senses. Richard Baldwin
OK, so let me take that in three batches. So the classic is that you have to retaliate when people do unfair, unusual things in trade. That is the basis even of the World Trade Organization system. For instance, if you subsidise your exports, I put on a duty against your exports — countervailing duties. That retaliation is the core of what maintains the peace, to start with. Now, what the Chinese did in the Trump first administration is they retaliated, but always a little bit less than he did. And so it was a de-escalatory kind of retaliation. But if nothing else, it allowed them to hold their heads high in front of their citizens and saying, we’re not being bullied by this guy. So that’s the classic take is to retaliate. And I think basically every country has to go that way because this is a man who does not respect weakness. The second part of it is, I think you got to realise that what this guy wants is to look good. And so I think, for instance, in Mexico and Canada, when Trump threatened them with 25 per cent tariffs, which was not credible, they gave some visuals that made it look like Trump won, but essentially things they were doing already and they were recast as a big win for the negotiations. And you can see an element of this because when Trump negotiates, he’s very vague about what the negotiations are about. He muddies the water. So at any point he can declare victory and say, see, they made a concession. But the important part there is not to make him look like a fool and to go along with the face-saving at the end of the whole thing. And I think a lot of foreign leaders have figured this out. And there’s also, you know, venal things, like helping his family with deals around the world, for instance. So the third take on it, is I think what we got to do is stop viewing Trump as playing a standard game of international relations power. You know, give and take, retaliation, threats, mutually assured destruction. And realise what he’s playing is what we call the mad-dog strategy. And that is you come across the street and there’s this mad dog, absolutely wild, so wild it may be that the dog engages in things that are bad for him, and so you can’t predict what they’re going to do by looking at their self-interest. The dog could run across the street despite the traffic, and then bite you just because it’s a mad dog. Now, the strategy for a mad dog is to be calm and not concede to whatever he wants. And in this case, if Trump gets one thing from the Europeans, he’s going to want another thing from the Europeans. So you can’t give in to the mad-dog strategy. The key there is to realise he really isn’t mad, and he has the political constraint of keeping his base happy, which means not really putting on tariffs too much. He has the political constraint of not really disrupting American manufacturing by raising the cost of imported intermediates in the US, making the US a high-cost island. So I put all those three things together, and I think to a certain extent, the way especially the Mexican president played it, was very careful. She was harsh to start with in claiming that sovereignty, national pride, retaliation, etc. And then at the end, made some face-saving concessions that Trump could then say, look, I won this. I forced them into these concessions, even though they weren’t very big concessions. Martin Wolf Thank you very much. I think that’s a very good overview. So we’re going to take a break now. And when we get back, I’m going to ask Richard about the one area of trade that is still growing really rapidly. And yet it is often overlooked because, as economists like to say, it is invisible.  [MUSIC PLAYING] We’re back from the break, and now we’re going to be talking about invisibles, the extraordinary growth of trade in things that we used not to measure. Richard Baldwin
Martin, do you know where that ‘invisible’ term came from? Martin Wolf
No. Richard Baldwin
So in the old days of fixed exchange rates, foreign exchange had to go through the official accounts, right? That was the way it was. And foreign exchange would show up in the Treasury account and they’d go like, what the hell is this? And, well, it’s invisible trade. Martin Wolf
Yes. Richard Baldwin
Because it didn’t . . . the customs data . . .  Martin Wolf
Because there were no customs data. Yes. Richard Baldwin
Right. They called it trade in invisibles because, you know, they didn’t know where it was. Martin Wolf
Wonderful. I didn’t know that. Now, how important, if at all, are tariffs on goods when the fastest growth in trade is in services and particularly digital services. And tariffs have really nothing to do with that at all. You can’t use a tariff to stop that. So are we just as Trump is fixated with the past, the really deep past, most analysts are also fixated with what is really the past and not the present and future of world trade. Richard Baldwin
Yes, I think that’s absolutely true. And I would make a couple comments. One is China is making a mistake by focusing so much on manufacturing, when all the good jobs in the future economy are going to be in sophisticated services. So that’s point one. But the second thing is about it’s not just its services are growing faster than goods trade. I think there’s a systemic, long-term technological reason why trade, especially in manufactured goods, is declining. And that’s got to do with the automation of manufacturing. So the real reason it’s more cost-effective to produce things in China or Vietnam or Mexico is because the cost of labour. But as automation takes the labour out of manufacturing, then the incentive to make it far away diminishes. And on the services side, the technology is moving exactly the opposite way. The wage differences between skilled service sector workers across countries is enormous. Something like, you know, over 1,000 per cent differences. And as digital technology makes it easier for us to work from home, we will see more of this arbitrage where offices in high-wage, rich countries start to use more and more professionals, highly qualified, skilled people located in developing countries or emerging markets, high-education, low-wage emerging markets. So that’s where I think we are. The second thing you said was about tariffs. And that I think is really interesting. All the discussion about geopolitics, the vast majority of it is US-China in manufactured goods. There is tiny bits in services like TikTok or the services in electric vehicles in the United States and things like that. But as you pointed out, it’s basically impossible to put a tariff on a service that crosses borders because it doesn’t go through customs. In fact, it’s often not recorded. One of the most remarkable things about services statistics is that they’re terrible, because it’s hard to gather statistics on, for example, when if an American consulting firm hires somebody in Poland to fix up their PowerPoint slides and then brings it back. In principle, that’s trade. But you can be almost positive that that did not enter into US trade in services statistics. And the reasons why it’s hard to gather statistics are exactly the reason it’s hard to put on tariffs. It’s hard to know how much they’re worth. No country has really figured out how to put tariffs on trade in services, and I think it’s a technological thing.  Now let me do a slight side, because if you talk to most analysts, they’ll tell you that trade in services is incredibly protected. There’s even something called the OECD Services Trade Restrictiveness Index, which shows enormous barriers in trade in services. But here’s the key: those barriers affect B2C, business to consumer. So for example, architectural services. If you want to hire an architect to design a house or a building, that’s from B2C and it’s incredibly heavily regulated. Same for medicine, law, accounting, all sorts of things like that.  But if it’s B2B, for instance, if the architect who’s based in America and accredited in America wants to hire an Indian architect to design, say, the stairwell blocks, there is no barrier on that. So the idea is that this explosion is in intermediate services or B2B services, not in final services. So what we’re seeing is an explosion of global service value chains now, like we saw in the 1990s with manufacturing. And that’s where your wonderful phrase was, I use all the time now, that we have offices crossing borders, not just factories and goods. In other words, people organising remote teams that include low-cost, high-quality foreign workers in the supply chain. And by the way, I just would note that that’s what we’re doing now since I’m in Switzerland and you’re in the UK. I’m actually exporting services to the UK, but I’m pretty sure it won’t show up either in the Swiss statistics or in the UK statistics. Of course, none of us are getting paid for this, so maybe it shouldn’t. But that’s the kind of example. Think about how difficult it would be to tax the transmission we’re doing right now. Making the recording with a tariff, it would be almost impossible. Martin Wolf
These are very important points I’ve been arguing for quite a long time, actually. That is very, very clear from the data that manufacturing is going the way of agriculture, which is that essentially we feed ourselves across the world astoundingly well with a tiny fraction of the labour force in farming that we used to have 100 years, or 200 years ago, because productivity in agriculture has completely transformed. It’s not very difficult to imagine a world, and it may not be very far away in which in factories everywhere, there won’t be any workers. I mean, essentially it’s all going to be done by robots of various kinds, because robots are so good at this. So this idea that we’re going to recreate huge labour forces in manufacturing is completely undermined by the most fundamental technological changes of our time. There is a security reason, perhaps, for having semiconductors made in the United States, but we’re never going to have a million people making chips. We’re going to have machines making chips. But there is an argument that the labour arbitrage in services that you mention could be undermined really rather dramatically by artificial intelligence. Let me give you an example which I’ve actually come across. You could send X-ray images to India and you would get Indian radiologists to look at these. Much, much cheaper than American radiologists, perfectly well trained and they would tell you what they’d seen. But now AI is really good at pattern recognition, better than humans and probably will get better and better. And therefore there is an alternative for your American firm. They’re just going to have it done at home by a computer. Now of course, that means the employment goes anyway, so it doesn’t make any difference to all the people in our jobs with high skills, which are being reduced in value very dramatically. But it would have a different impact on trade, wouldn’t it? Richard Baldwin
Yes. So I’ve written an article published last year which looks at the globotics quadrant. So we take on the vertical axis the degree of automatability of a particular profession. And on the horizontal axis we put the teleworkability of the occupation, and then we plot all the US occupations. And the ones up here in the north-east are both highly automatable and highly offshoreable, so to speak. And that’s where your substitutions come in. But there are other quadrants where it’s offshoreable, but not automatable; where it’s neither; where it’s automatable, but not offshoreable. There’s jobs in all four quadrants. And the point that remote intelligence and artificial intelligence are substitutes is true, but only for some jobs. So the classic example is in chatbots versus call centres. So call centres employment is going down in places like the Philippines and India because chatbots are taking over a lot of it. But there are other things where AI is making the foreign workers even more competitive. And a paper that we just published, we found that GenAI made South African workers better substitutes for Americans when both were using GenAI. And then afterwards, we asked American-based online people to guess whether the work product that they did was done by an American or by a South African. And when they were using GenAI, it was random. They could not identify who was South African, which indicated that GenAI is actually making foreign workers better substitutes because not only does it affect their productivity, it also allows them to be more culturally adapted to their audience. GenAI is fluent in cultural differences and nuances, so they’re not writing in South African English. They’re writing in American English when they use the GenAI. So I think it cuts both ways. But certainly there are occupations where AI is going to undermine international trade in services, but there are other ones where it’s actually going to amplify it. And I think on the whole, GenAI will make foreign workers better substitutes for workers in rich countries. Martin Wolf
I think the big conclusion here is that our politics are focusing on jobs in manufacturing, which is sort of ancient history. But what is really going to come our way, and that I’ve got this from much of your writing, is a huge upheaval in jobs, in services, and particularly in relatively sophisticated jobs. And that will affect the middle and upper-middle classes of our societies, and the politics of that are really going to be something. Richard Baldwin
Well, that’s absolutely true. Service and professional workers are facing pressures from globalisation, direct wage competition and automation threatening their jobs. So just as automation and globalisation threaten manufacturing jobs and led to a backlash in manufacturing sectors, I think that’s coming to the service sector. So I couldn’t agree more. Martin Wolf
So thank you very much. We’ve had a wonderful overview of what’s been happening to trade. What is happening to trade now with Donald Trump and what is likely to happen to trade, because the revolutions we have been seeing in the last 30, 40 years, particularly within manufacturing, are now coming to services. Richard Baldwin, thank you very much. Richard Baldwin My pleasure. Any time.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Martin Wolf
That’s all for this week. You’ve been listening to The Economics Show from the FT. This episode was produced by Laurence Knight, with original music and sound engineering by Breen Turner. Our executive producer is Manuela Saragosa. The broadcast engineers are Andrew Georgiades and Rod Fitzgerald. Cheryl Brumley is the FT’s global head of audio. I’m Martin Wolf. Thanks for listening.",2025-02-24,This is an audio transcript of The Economics Show podcast episode,"In this episode of The Economics Show, Martin Wolf interviews Richard Baldwin, an expert in international economics, discussing the future of global trade amidst the policies of Donald Trump. Baldwin argues that Trump’s approach to tariffs—20th-century solutions—fails to address the complexities of modern global supply chains and has little effectiveness. He explains that globalization has reached a plateau, driven by tech-enabled offshoring and changing production dynamics, particularly due to China's growth.

Baldwin identifies three phases of globalization: trade in goods, trade in parts and components (the second phase), and the current phase, which involves the global exchange of services and knowledge. As labor costs rise in China, manufacturing is increasingly automated and labor-intensive processes shift to countries with cheaper skills like Vietnam.

He critiques Trump’s tariff strategy, emphasizing that while it may aim to bolster U.S. manufacturing, it likely results in higher costs without reviving the sector significantly. The conversation also touches on emerging trends in digital services, where tariffs are ineffective, highlighting a shift toward sophisticated service work that could further pressure jobs in high-wage countries.

Overall, both Wolf and Baldwin underscore that the political focus on protecting manufacturing jobs may overlook the larger upheaval occurring within the service sector, which is becoming increasingly competitive and automated."

With Alice Evans ,"This is an audio transcript of The Economics Show podcast episode: ‘Why are birth rates falling? With Alice Evans’

John Burn-Murdoch
The birth rate in England and Wales and the United States both reached record lows in the last year. But still developing Turkey, has gone even lower than the UK and in America and Mexico — just south of the border, even lower than the US. Why are birth rates falling so quickly and in so many places? And can the trend be reversed?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

I’m John Burn-Murdoch and this is The Economics Show from the Financial Times. My guest today is perfectly placed to speak on this topic. Dr Alice Evans is a social scientist who spends her time travelling countries all around the world, from the Atlas Mountains to the swamps of Zambia, talking to people about the decisions and their calculus, in whether to form relationships, whether to have children, all of the key things in life. Alice writes The Great Gender Divergence Substack. And Alice is someone who I exchange thoughts, ideas, pleasantries with from time to time. But today is the first time that we’re meeting in person. So, Alice, welcome to the studio. It’s great to finally meet you.

Alice Evans
John, thank you so much. It’s an absolute pleasure. You know, I think of you as my free RA — I use your graphs all the time.

John Burn-Murdoch
Alright, yeah. I would feel a bit more exploited if it weren’t for the excellent tips you’ve given me on laminate flooring recently, so it’s all good.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

So let’s start at a very high level here, what is happening with birth rates at the moment?

Alice Evans
They’re collapsing all over the world in Tunisia, in Turkey, in Tamil Nadu, in Guatemala, in Mexico, birth rates are absolutely cratering.

John Burn-Murdoch
When we say collapsing — that’s an explosive word — what are we talking about?

Alice Evans
Well, Turkey and Tunisia, each woman is having around 1.5 children, so this is really low.

John Burn-Murdoch
Well, how does that compare to the situation in some western countries, for example, one would imagine like coming at this as a novice, one would expect, OK, birth rates are falling in places like Turkey and Tunisia, but surely they’re still a fair bit higher than in somewhere like western Europe.

Alice Evans
So in England and Wales, our total fertility rate is 1.44 children per woman. That is exactly the same as Tamil Nadu today.

John Burn-Murdoch
Wow. And Turkey I think is similar. So...

Alice Evans
Yes, exactly. So even when countries are much, much poorer with very different cultural systems, fertility is falling everywhere and very low everywhere.

John Burn-Murdoch
Very interesting. Now we’ll get on to some of the why and then differences between different countries and regions. But maybe to start with the different one. Is this a problem or if it is a problem, why is this a problem? You know, Sir Keir Starmer in the UK has famously said he doesn’t really have a strategy or policy around doing anything about birth rates. This is a topic of conversation that I think a lot of people are quite uncomfortable talking about. Other people generally say this is a good thing, especially if they are thinking about this from the perspective of sustainability and the environment, why should we be having this conversation at all?

Alice Evans
OK, so economically, readers of the FT will be interested. So first of all, you know, I’m very, very fond of my grandparents. But to be brutally honest, older people are not very economically active, right? They tend to be out of the workforce, less dynamic, less entrepreneurial, less likely to start companies. So as the US economy ages, firms become less dynamic. We have fewer start-ups. We have less innovation. You know, young people have all these ideas and creativity. And as the population ages, the entire economy becomes a little bit more sluggish. So that’s one aspect.

The second aspect is the fiscal squeeze. So the EU is increasingly spending a large amount of government revenue on care for older people, on pensions for older people. So we now have a ginormous pensions time bomb. Spain, instead of spending on flood defences, on green industrial policy has this massive growing pension time bomb, which is an ever larger share of GDP. Now how do we pay for an elderly population? Two ways: so one is that people . . . individuals may cut down on consumption to save more. In China, young people are reducing their consumption to save for retirement. Alternatively, young people like you and me will have to pay a higher rate of taxation to pay for our elderly workforce.

Now those are relatively prosperous societies. What about the much, much poorer societies like Tamil Nadu, where fertility is now really low? So in Tamil Nadu, only 29 per cent of urban women are working. That means the average guy will be supporting two sets of elderly parents. That is an enormous burden on a young man’s shoulders. So right across the world, we’re dealing with an older population that is less dynamic, we’re cutting back on our consumption, we’ll be taxing our younger people less. So it really, really hurts everyone’s welfare. If you care about climate breakdown, if you want green industrial policy, you need money to spend on that strategy. And we’re short of it.

John Burn-Murdoch
Right, and I guess you also need innovation. And as you say, older society is less innovative, they’re maybe not gonna come up with that next clean technology.

And coming back to that economic point, I guess what we may be saying here is there’s a slight tension between people who say they’re concerned about whether it’s rising taxes or whether it’s about diminishing opportunities for younger people or the greater burden placed on younger people, they would say they’re concerned about that. But then if you mention birth rates, they say, oh no, that’s a conservative talking point. And what you’re saying is a lot of these things are related. And if people are concerned about the former, then this is a conversation they should be having or listening to.

Alice Evans
Absolutely. So at the moment, the conversation of birth rates is sort of divided between conservatives and misogynists who blame childless cat ladies or progressives and liberals who just don’t want to touch it. And personally, as a social scientist, I think we should contribute to that public conversation. Work out what’s really going on so we can have an evidence-based strategy.

John Burn-Murdoch
Absolutely. And then one other thing you’ve not mentioned, but I know you’ve written about in the past, is one of the other options available to these countries who are struggling with ageing and declining populations would be immigration. But I think you’ve had a look at the numbers involved there, and that perhaps if people think that even progressives who think that they would prefer that solution rather than trying to find some way to boost birth rates, that’s maybe not as easy a fix as people think.

Alice Evans
Absolutely. So immigration can be a tremendous boon for innovation. As diverse people mix and mingle and share ideas. Now, Lant Pritchett was previously on this podcast with Martin Wolf said he expects that in order to maintain the working age population to population ratio, we would need up from around 2050 to have around 40 to 60 per cent of Europe and rich countries being migrants. Now that poses major challenges for integration, if not well handled.

John Burn-Murdoch
And just to clarify that you’re saying 40 to 60 per cent of what number would need to be immigrants?

Alice Evans
Sorry, of the population would need to be migrants, of Europe, would need to be migrants.

John Burn-Murdoch
Remarkable.

Alice Evans
Yeah. A massive, massive transformation which could cause social tensions or political backlash, which we’re already seeing now. It could be properly handled. It could be totally fine. In fact, there are many different ways in which we could avoid the challenges of low fertility. You know, maybe AI will generate tremendous advances in productivity. Maybe there are all sorts of ways we could skirt around the issue, but each of them have their own difficulties.

John Burn-Murdoch
Absolutely. And I guess what we’re saying here is this has to be part of the conversation. Again, if the premise is that people don’t want these, you know, soaring tax rates and they do want the same level of public spending, pensions, healthcare, all of that to be maintained, then it’s pretty much impossible to do that if birth rates keep falling, or at least the solution are things that most people would not say are realistic.

Alice Evans
Absolutely. So there is a trilemma. If you want a wealthy, prosperous Europe with a social safety net, you need to expand the working-age population. And that can come through migrants. That can come through fertility.

John Burn-Murdoch
But I guess just on a very simple level, some of the societies that people look at and consider to be, you know, a bit older, a bit more stagnant, so I’m thinking, you know, I’m gonna generalise and stereotype, but Japan, Italy, for example, these are, you know, famously slow growth over, over the recent period of time. And I know a colleague of yours, someone we both know, Jesús Fernández-Villaverde.

Alice Evans
Fernández-Villaverde

John Burn-Murdoch
Yes, he did work on this showing that . . . 

Alice Evans
He’s done tremendous work. So macroeconomics for the past 20 years have been puzzled. Why? What’s wrong with Japan’s economy? What’s wrong with their macro situation? And Jesús Fernández-Villaverde has looked into himself. If you look at the output per worker of the working-age population, Japan is doing totally fine. There’s nothing wrong with the average Japanese worker and their productivity. The issue is that there are fewer workers. They’re all getting much, much older. And older people like my grandmother are just economically inactive. And that tanks everyone down, right? That is the cause of Japan’s malaise.

John Burn-Murdoch
I think you’ve made a strong case for why this is an important conversation to be having, regardless of what one’s other beliefs might be. So what are some of the standard theories for why this is happening and the way it’s happening?

Alice Evans
OK, so let’s start with economics. So one idea is that as societies get richer, as we see skills-bias technological change, then parents invest more in the quality of each child.

John Burn-Murdoch
Can we just spell out what we mean by skills biased technological change?

Alice Evans
All right. OK. So as economies shift away from brawn, lifting up heavy rocks to, you know, using our skills and intellect, parents may decide, right, in order to maximise my opportunities or my children’s opportunities, I’m going to heavily invest in their education so they can capitalise on new jobs, right? So that was a standard theory of this quality-quantity trade-off.

But that just doesn’t seem to hold because this fertility collapse is happening at all levels of income, right? So Tamil Nadu is much poorer than the UK but has exactly the same level of fertility. So it can’t just be about economic development.

John Burn-Murdoch
So you mentioned that this idea of the quality-quantity trade-off. So the idea of having fewer kids but investing more time and resources into them as a parent, could you talk a bit more about that? And you know, what were the reasons people made those arguments in the first place? Is it that that’s not a thing, or is it just less a thing than people thought?

Alice Evans
OK, so we also need to think about the costs of having children, both financially and emotionally. So when I did research in Hong Kong, in Korea last year, you know, women would say about how much they struggle to get their children into the very best kindergarten. Or in South Korea, they send their children to hagwons, private tuition ends at 10pm max camp. So parents all over the western world, in the US, in Europe, are spending much more, sort of what we call intensive parenting. Sort of maximising their children’s outcome. That’s costly. Rising house prices in London makes children more expensive. So cost is certainly a factor, but I don’t think it’s the primary driver because these things are happening everywhere all at once, even where those costs aren’t such a significant part of people’s consumption.

John Burn-Murdoch
And on that, so I think it’s a really important point. I know I’ve also seen a bunch of studies where people are literally asked . . . prospective parents are asked, what are some of the things stopping you from having kids and living costs, housing costs, however defined, are always on that list. But they’re very, very, very rarely in the top two or three reasons. So I think it’s an important point to make that, you know, these things clearly matter on some level, but they don’t seem to be pivotal in this decision-making process. Is that fair?

Alice Evans
I think an important distinction to make is that things can be bad and unpleasant for a whole host of other reasons, right? So I’m not here saying that high house prices in London aren’t the problem. High house prices are a problem. Living cost . . . the cost of living crisis is a problem. But that’s not necessarily the reason why people make fertility decisions. It’s not the cost of living crisis which explains why fertility is plummeting in the Guatemalan highlands. You know, they don’t have the Chelsea housing situation.

John Burn-Murdoch
Yeah, that we know of. Well, you’ve probably been down on your travel schedule. Interesting. So, that’s sort of the direct economic and financial costs. Based on all your reading, your research, your interviews, what do you actually think is going on here?

Alice Evans
I think a really important factor is the rise of singles worldwide.

John Burn-Murdoch
And what do you mean there? So the rise of people who are single, not in relationships, that kind of thing?

Alice Evans
Yeah, exactly. So right across the world, in the Middle East, in the Americas, in east Asia, soaring rates of people neither cohabiting nor being married.

John Burn-Murdoch
And this, I guess, is an interesting addition to the traditional debate because we’ve been used to thinking . . . because this is what did happen. We’ve been used to thinking, well, what we’re looking at here is couples who are deciding not to have kids or to have kids later, whereas the data from the last decade or two is showing that it’s not that. It’s that people who are in married couples or in stable, long-term, cohabiting relationships are still having kids at the same rate as ever, it’s just that those relationships are fewer and further between that, they’re either not forming as at such higher rates or they’re dissolving more quickly.

Alice Evans
Absolutely. So more young people are staying single or they’re marrying later. And if you marry later, that reproductive window is that much smaller. And so that limits the number of children you’re going to have, even if you do find a happy, loving, committed relationship.

John Burn-Murdoch
And well, on that point, what is it that has changed in recent years? If we’re now moving away from why do people have or not have kids to why do they couple up or not couple up? And you mentioned there loving relationships, you have some theories here, right? For why we’ve seen these big sort of structural changes.

Alice Evans
Absolutely. So let’s first of all think historically why was marriage so high historically? Two things: well, I think that people would have married for love, money or respect. So in socially conservative societies, is it absolutely a must to gain status and social inclusion to marry? So when I lived in Zambia for 18 months, people would continually pester me. Alice, when are you getting married? When are you getting married? When I was in Uzbekistan for a month last year, people would constantly say to me, Alice, are you married? That was the first thing people wanted to know about me. The primary most important aspect of my identity? Am I married or not? But with the exception of Uzbekistan and Zambia, what was the most downloaded song last year, John? You know this one?

John Burn-Murdoch
Was it Miley Cyrus, Flowers?

Alice Evans
Exactly. Exactly. Flowers, right? So this is a song celebrating, glorifying, saying that young women can buy themselves flowers. So as men and women’s earnings converge as societies liberalise or women sort of develop different ideas of their own, then they’ll be like, actually, no, you know, these guys don’t quite meet my aspirations and expectations. I’m going to be a little bit more selective. To quote Ariana Grande, ‘Thank U, Next.’

John Burn-Murdoch
So many pop culture references. This is unusual for this podcast, but I welcome it. But a question that you talked about a few different things there. So this, as you say, could be in an indirect way, economics. You know, if men’s relative economic status is perhaps diminishing and women’s is rising, maybe that means there are fewer of those sort of economically, financially convenient relationships, as you said, but there’s also this rapid spread of these values and culture. And I get loads of research showing there’s some really interesting stuff showing that when young women gain access to the internet, they have the spread of liberal ideals. Doesn’t happen to young men. Really interesting.

Alice Evans
Absolutely. So in the US, in Europe, to a lesser extent, in south Asia, we do see economic convergence between young men and women. And as you yourself have shown in your excellent data analysis that especially for less educated men in Britain, women might even be earning more or more likely to be employed.

So you might say that women just don’t have the economic need for men. That said, even in countries where female employment rates were very low, like much of north Africa, the Middle East and in South Korea — which has got the largest gender pay gaps in the world of over 30 per cent — we still see this massive plummeting of relationships. So it’s almost as if women are saying, even if I need to subsist on my smaller income or live with my parents, I’d rather do that because my values and aspirations are slightly different to my mother.

So what I suggest is going on is this term, which I call “cultural leapfrogging”. So right across the world we see this massive growth in access the internet and smartphones. Now once a woman has her own phone, she can, you know, dial in to whatever. And she enjoys this, this plethora of this amazing breadth of entertainment and media and stories, online literature. So women increasingly tell their own stories on Chinese literature city, and they get different ideas and their aspirations for relationships change. So in China and South Korea, women don’t necessarily want the same lives as their mothers. So, you know, in South Korea, a massive hit was Born 1982, which is all about the everyday sexism. So young women are increasingly rejecting that.

So in my interviews in Morocco, in Turkey, in Mexico, women tell me that their favourite shows on Netflix might be The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, for example, or Emily in Paris, which is one of the ones I heard in Malaysia. So all these women can sort of tune into, you know, the western frontier of gender equality and think, hey, actually, I’d rather have that. So a couple of months ago in Malaysia, these young women were saying, you know, these men were uncomfortable with my autonomy and me being assertive and me saying what I wanted, and so actually, I decided that I deserved better and I wanted better, and I didn’t want to reduce my selves to placate their egos. So increasingly, young women are saying, I have different values, I have different aspirations, I’d rather be alone.

John Burn-Murdoch
So I guess again, it’s about . . . It is sort of indirectly about that gap in values and goals and aspirations between young men and women or not the gap in their aspirations, but a gap in what they expect from each sex. And so in these countries where you’ve got the proliferation of new digital media and new western media, where you previously had young men and women in, let’s say, the Middle East, fairly aligned on what they thought their future looked like, a gap is now emerging.

Alice Evans
So that’s one of the factors, absolutely. So it could be an ideological mismatch, but it can also be personality mismatches. So for example, you know in the past, you know, many women or men would have married people who are abusive, narcissistic, manipulative, aggressive, passive-aggressive. But now people might choose to be more selective. They might, you know, read romantic novels and think, actually, I want a man who adores me, who cares who me, who’s nice, who I enjoy spending time with. So even if they were sort of similar in ideology, we might dislike their personality. There’s no monocausal explanation about why people aren’t coupling up.

You know, another possible factor is that as people spend more time on their phones, for instance, you know, it’s so enjoyable to just, you know, sit at home in your pyjamas. Or maybe I just speak to myself and, you know, browse the internet, chat to your friends instead of some low-effort socialising, low-effort entertainment. And so people socialise less. They’re not necessarily meeting people so much. You’ve got all these other alternatives. And the shame and stigma attached to being single totally declined. So whether it’s ideology, whether it’s personality or whether it’s just because you couldn’t be bothered to get dressed, people are staying alone. And that contributes to the rise of singles.

Now, curiously, India actually has a stable rate of marriage. So here it’s not the rise of singles causing the decline in fertility. So why isn’t marriage falling across India? There are two possible hypotheses: one is that smartphone access is relatively recent in India. You know, its economic growth has really accelerated over the past 10, 15 years. But not long ago, very, very few women . . . it was 7 per cent in 2015 had mobile phone technology. So a related, a major issue in India and in south Asia more broadly is that there was a massive gender gap in smartphone ownership. So because male honour depends on female seclusion and the caste system motivates very tight policing of women’s whereabouts and mobility, families might deny women a phone. So the man might have a phone, but the woman won’t. So that means that women would be forced, or rather opt into watching media communally. So not necessarily eke out their own independent ideas on different media. So there is a gender gap in smartphone ownership and that could inhibit this “culture leapfrogging”.

In addition to that, India’s economy is overwhelmingly run through caste lines. So when Indians want a job, access to a loan or even a new place to stay in the city, they might live near their kin or get a loan from their kin, or get help from their kin. They’re called jati and these jati networks are secured — these trusted networks of cooperation are secured by ensuring that girls, women marry within their jati. That is a way of consolidating these caste systems. So marriage remains vital. Marriage remains vital to the Indian economy, which is run around caste. Marriage secures these links. So we have two possibilities, right? It’s either that women weren’t able to do this cultural leapfrogging because they didn’t necessarily have phones until very recently, or it’s because caste is so important. Marriage is so important. It feeds into what I was saying earlier that the uncles and aunties are constantly saying, when are you getting married? When are you getting married?

John Burn-Murdoch
Right. And also, I would guess, and you’ll know this better than I, that maybe the convergence in socio-economic fortunes of young men and women in India has been much more muted than elsewhere. So just from pure economic incentives of coupling up, it’s probably, I would imagine, much more of a no-brainer for a socio-economically lower status and sort of disempowered young women in India to just go into a relationship with a guy.

Alice Evans
So that’s an interesting hypothesis. That said, let me . . . I will use your phrase, John, to put two wrinkles in that. So one is that Indian female higher education now outpaces men’s. So more women are in university than men in India. In Himachal Pradesh, the gender ratio is actually equal to that of the US 1.4. So women are increasingly educated. So they could conceivably choose to be single and get their own jobs. Moreover, India’s rate of female labour force participation is 37 per cent, which is actually above parts of the Middle East and north Africa. So it can’t be economics alone that explains why marriage is plummeting in the Middle East and north Africa, but not in south Asia. So that’s why I’m more sort of open to this caste-based hypothesis that the economy is run on caste and you just have to get married is one possibility.

John Burn-Murdoch
Fascinating. Absolutely fascinating. This is why I always love chatting to you. So, one of the things I must ask on this topic of the rising rates of singledom or lower rates of relationship formation, however, we want to think about it is. There’s a stereotype I hear a lot at least, is that a lot of this is your Emily-in-Paris type situation, or your Sex-in-the-City type situation. This is smart, well-educated young women. A lot of options open to them who are, you know, they’re just not finding a good enough partner or, you know, their careers and lives are giving them a lot of fulfilment that they don’t necessarily want to put on the back burner. Is that borne out in the data when we look at who is not coupling up?

Alice Evans
OK. Great question. So first and foremost, as female education massively outpaces men’s, we might expect that university-educated women struggle to find an equally educated man. That said, when we look at the data of both marriage and fertility, it is the most deprived men, the most socio-economically disadvantaged, who are really struggling to find wives and girlfriends. And that holds in the US, it holds in Finland and it holds in South Korea. So the men who can’t attract, right? So if you don’t have a system of arranged marriages, then you’ve got to use your charm, your wits, your wealth, your status to impress the ladies and the men at the back of the list are really struggling.

John Burn-Murdoch
And of course, you know, wherever there’s a low-status man, not in a couple, there’s a low-status woman, not in a couple. So the overarching point here is that if some people listens to this and think, oh, you know, the rise of single people is just social progress. These are people with, you know, high disposable incomes living very fulfilling lives. Sure, there is some of that. But the main trend here is people at the bottom end of society who for all of these various reasons, are not finding the stability in the relationships that they would have done in the past.

Alice Evans
Absolutely. And I’m so glad you raised that, John, because I think it’s a serious and important point, you know. So one might think that it’s the Miley Cyrus or the Taylor Swift’s that are single. No, Taylor Swift is like, got like her alpha male boyfriend who’s championing her and supporting her. The real crisis and the reason why all of this really, really matters from a liberal, progressive perspective, is it is the most disadvantaged people who are struggling to find love, to build families, to have fulfilment.

And it’s these groups which are struggling from an epidemic of loneliness, of feeling unwanted and are and maybe historically, you know, some progressive forces would have sort of laughed at incels or mocked those kinds of guys, you know, typing behind their computers, left alone. But it’s a really sad development. You know, the feeling of being unwanted, the feeling of being . . . that no one values you, that no one appreciates you, that women just won’t give you the time of day. This is feeding frustrations and it has real political consequences.

John Burn-Murdoch
And again, it may be men who are on, you could say the sharp end of this or here is at the heart of this, but the result of that is large numbers of single people, therefore having to survive of one income where they would have done of two, both men and women.

Alice Evans
Yeah, absolutely. So actually, you know, I’d like to hear more about working-class men because they’ve had such a hard time. So one is they’ve been hit by automation. So as automation hits jobs in manual labour, in construction, in manufacturing, then the demand for those jobs has totally decimated, the pay for those jobs has totally decimated.

Meanwhile, men are struggling to progress in education, so they remain much more vulnerable so . . . the least educated remain much more vulnerable to all those economic shocks. And then they’re unable to get a girlfriend. So you’re unable to progress economically and you’re unable to progress romantically. So yeah, this is a massive, massive issue for much of the world that has a premium on skills.

John Burn-Murdoch
Right. So you’ve got these big sweeping global economic shifts happening over decades and then there’s sort of the light that’s applied to that kindling is then the spread of digital media, changing attitudes, the rise in the sense that women can actually look at those trends if they’re aware of them and say, yeah, this isn’t a good deal for me any more.

Alice Evans
Yeah, absolutely. So it should not surprise anyone when men who feel economically disadvantaged, struggling in numerous ways, struggling to get a girlfriend, and then meanwhile they hear a lot, you know, progressives championing women saying, you know, we’ve got to support women. We’ve got to have our women-only team. We’re so proud of feminist advances. These men are like, you know, but what about us when we’re not getting anything? And so those men who feel very neglected are now gravitating to voices that will give them status, that will give them authority, whether that’s the AfD, the far-right, Reform or Trump, right? Because no one else is giving them the time of day, and I’m not justifying any of that, but you can understand, you know, how everything we talked about today has serious political consequences.

John Burn-Murdoch
Exactly, exactly. It’s just we start talking about birth rates. You end up with something much, much, much broader. OK, Alice, fantastic stuff. Really enjoying this. But we’re gonna take a little break. And when we come back, let’s move on to what happens next. Should something be done about this and if so, what?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

OK, we’re back. Alice, I want to move this on to throw it forward. Now, I guess there’s two parts to this question. First is all of these big shifts, which as we talked about, you know, it’s not that they are capital B bad, but there are certainly some negative repercussions and implications. Is this something that governments, policymakers, etc should be doing anything about? And then I guess the second part, which we can come on to afterwards, is what might that be? What might work? What might not work?

Alice Evans
OK. So let’s handle that maybe in three parts. I guess the first question is political and ethical. So we might think that as a liberal society should we tell people what to do? And you know, I think for most of our listeners that would feel kind of repugnant, right? But we do need to grapple with the two facts, the economic implications, that this is a pensions time bomb and that many people are unhappy. They’re lonely, right? So we do have some kind of issue that we might want to think about. So then the next question is, well, what the hell do we do about it? And I think the first and most important thing to recognise is that the standard fixes are incredibly inadequate.

John Burn-Murdoch
So when you say standard fixes, what are we talking about there?

Alice Evans
So baby bonuses. So giving people whether it’s in Finland, you know, a baby package, you know congratulations or whether it’s a New York universal pre-K, pre-kindergarten or Korea, all kinds of cash incentives to have children, also tried in China. The evidence, the academic evidence from around the world is that none of this works. It makes zero difference. Really little difference.

John Burn-Murdoch
I’m gonna call you on that one, because I’ve been called out on saying that before. I think what we’re saying is it’s not that it makes zero difference, but you’ve basically got a downward-sloping line. And what a policy, what policies like these do is they might move that line very slightly upwards. So, a few people might have kids that they weren’t going to have, but mainly it’s either people just banking that bonus to have a kid they were gonna have anyway, or it’s like we say it’s shifting the line upwards, but it’s not changing the direction. So these things, it’s not that they quote unquote don’t work, but they are inadequate in the face of everything else we’ve been taught.

Alice Evans
You’re right that I should be more careful. So, for example, I’ve just come back from Hungary and they gave people who wanted to marry and have children, cheaper mortgages. And that was trialled for a couple of years. It led to an increase in marriage and fertility. Then they would draw it and plummeted again, became more expensive. So you could give people thousands and thousands of pounds to have children. You could massively increase the amount of money. And maybe if it was sufficiently high, you could induce people to have children. Maybe it’s just a matter of volume. You know, throw cash at people and eventually they’ll start procreating.

But I think it’s relatively second order and minor relative to the primary driver, and it puts the cart before the horse if people are not coupling up in the first place. Because having your children is so emotionally and financially costly, very few women now want to do it alone, and very few men want to do it alone. And if you’re not in a couple, You just have these massive, massive frictions that aren’t going to be solved with cheaper childcare. And so while cheaper childcare and better houses are great, and I fully support that, those dividends just don’t deal with the elephant in the room, which is the loneliness, right?

John Burn-Murdoch
I guess this goes back to what we were saying earlier. Like, if you think about if you conceptualise falling birth rates as an issue of couples sitting around deciding to not have or delay having kids, then of course, giving those couples money to incentivise them to have kids or giving them a bigger house in some way or another would help. But if we are actually talking about the fact that there are fewer couples, there are more people out there on their own, whether they’re living on the right or living with their parents, what’s the baby bonus gonna do to those people, right? So we have to almost reframe how we think that’s entirely.

Alice Evans
Right, absolutely. If you’re a single man and someone gives you £10,000 to have a kid, what do you do? Right? It’s just a, you know, these academic debates are quite slightly disconnected from many people’s reality. You know, the primary concern for many people in their 20s are dating struggles. That’s why people are constantly talking about dating apps. But in reality, it’s not the apps that are problem, it’s people.

John Burn-Murdoch
Right. Well, this comes on to my next point. If those things don’t work or they’re relatively ineffective, what would work? I mean, do we want government-sponsored speed dating? That doesn’t sound like something that is gonna be hugely popular.

Alice Evans
I think going back to my previous point, I think we have a real struggle in a liberal society where we have the most advanced technology in the world that makes spending time at home alone so much more pleasurable, right? And initially, that’s very easy and everyone else is doing it, so there’s no shame or stigma. But as we all select into our own lonely echo chambers, we drift further and further apart. And so for me, I do think it’s really important to build social infrastructure and to strengthen social skills.

John Burn-Murdoch
Right. And I guess again, it’s all about if we think about this in terms of being downstream of couples formation, if you think that what we really need to do is just have more people in relationships, again, we’re not talking here about arranged marriages or anything of the sort, but if at some level, relationship formation is a function of how many interactions you are having with people, then a world where there are fewer of those interactions, especially face to face, you get fewer relationships, you get fewer kids, you get all these issues we’re talking about.

So any change in society which put more people in front of each other face to face, whether, you know, reversing some of the work-from-home trends, like you say, people spending less time on digital media, whether that’s Netflix or on their smartphone, these you might not think of policies like these as being about relationships and birth rates, but they may have an impact simply mechanistically, by having more interaction between young men and women or people of the same sex.

Alice Evans
Yeah. I mean, let me stress that I, you know, I’m a card-carrying liberal. I grew up with, you know, texts like John Stuart Mill and, you know, I fully endorse that. But the problem is that if people can choose, then they might choose the easiest option, which is staying at home.

Let me give you an example. Back ten years ago, I used to train in the gym with a bunch of guys like really rowdy, a bunch guys and was super fun. We’d all chat. But now when I go into gyms, everyone is on their mobile phones. Very few people are chatting to their neighbours when they’re queueing for stuff.

John Burn-Murdoch
So it sounds like, you know, a lot of where we’ve ended up has been from fairly organic shifts in the world and in different parts of the world, not really any kind of policy change or certainly not anything with these sort of goals, which makes it hard to reverse this. But if you did have a magic wand and you could wave that wand and change one thing, maybe and maybe for the world as a whole, maybe for one part of the world to reverse some of these trends, what would that be?

Alice Evans
I think having a sort of a common standard school system is super, super important. I think having a curriculum that everyone can get on board with, you know, not something that is so conservative or so progressive that it alienates or triggers a backlash.

I think we want to restore a social fabric whereby people come to bond, empathise with each other and have the social skills to make jokes and to charm each other. And so schools are one way that might happen, especially if you remove smartphones. Get young people hanging out, making jokes and having fun.

John Burn-Murdoch
OK, so something that happens at young age and smartphones probably being a key part of it.

Alice Evans
Yeah.

John Burn-Murdoch
OK. Alice, thank you.

Alice Evans
John, this has been an absolute pleasure. Thank you so much.

That is all for this week. You’ve been listening to The Economics Show from the Financial Times. This episode was produced by Edith Rousselot with original music from Breen Turner. It is edited by Bryant Urstadt. Our executive producer is Manuela Saragosa. Cheryl Brumley is the FT’s global head of audio. I’m John Burn-Murdoch. Thanks for listening.",FEB 23 2025,Transcript,Transcript: Why are birth rates falling? With Alice Evans ,John Burn-Murdoch talks to social scientist Alice Evans ,John Burn-Murdoch,Print this page,(opens in new window),"John Burn-Murdoch
The birth rate in England and Wales and the United States both reached record lows in the last year. But still developing Turkey, has gone even lower than the UK and in America and Mexico — just south of the border, even lower than the US. Why are birth rates falling so quickly and in so many places? And can the trend be reversed? [MUSIC PLAYING] I’m John Burn-Murdoch and this is The Economics Show from the Financial Times. My guest today is perfectly placed to speak on this topic. Dr Alice Evans is a social scientist who spends her time travelling countries all around the world, from the Atlas Mountains to the swamps of Zambia, talking to people about the decisions and their calculus, in whether to form relationships, whether to have children, all of the key things in life. Alice writes The Great Gender Divergence Substack. And Alice is someone who I exchange thoughts, ideas, pleasantries with from time to time. But today is the first time that we’re meeting in person. So, Alice, welcome to the studio. It’s great to finally meet you. Alice Evans
John, thank you so much. It’s an absolute pleasure. You know, I think of you as my free RA — I use your graphs all the time. John Burn-Murdoch
Alright, yeah. I would feel a bit more exploited if it weren’t for the excellent tips you’ve given me on laminate flooring recently, so it’s all good. [MUSIC PLAYING] So let’s start at a very high level here, what is happening with birth rates at the moment? Alice Evans
They’re collapsing all over the world in Tunisia, in Turkey, in Tamil Nadu, in Guatemala, in Mexico, birth rates are absolutely cratering. John Burn-Murdoch
When we say collapsing — that’s an explosive word — what are we talking about? Alice Evans
Well, Turkey and Tunisia, each woman is having around 1.5 children, so this is really low. John Burn-Murdoch
Well, how does that compare to the situation in some western countries, for example, one would imagine like coming at this as a novice, one would expect, OK, birth rates are falling in places like Turkey and Tunisia, but surely they’re still a fair bit higher than in somewhere like western Europe. Alice Evans
So in England and Wales, our total fertility rate is 1.44 children per woman. That is exactly the same as Tamil Nadu today. John Burn-Murdoch
Wow. And Turkey I think is similar. So... Alice Evans
Yes, exactly. So even when countries are much, much poorer with very different cultural systems, fertility is falling everywhere and very low everywhere. John Burn-Murdoch
Very interesting. Now we’ll get on to some of the why and then differences between different countries and regions. But maybe to start with the different one. Is this a problem or if it is a problem, why is this a problem? You know, Sir Keir Starmer in the UK has famously said he doesn’t really have a strategy or policy around doing anything about birth rates. This is a topic of conversation that I think a lot of people are quite uncomfortable talking about. Other people generally say this is a good thing, especially if they are thinking about this from the perspective of sustainability and the environment, why should we be having this conversation at all? Alice Evans
OK, so economically, readers of the FT will be interested. So first of all, you know, I’m very, very fond of my grandparents. But to be brutally honest, older people are not very economically active, right? They tend to be out of the workforce, less dynamic, less entrepreneurial, less likely to start companies. So as the US economy ages, firms become less dynamic. We have fewer start-ups. We have less innovation. You know, young people have all these ideas and creativity. And as the population ages, the entire economy becomes a little bit more sluggish. So that’s one aspect. The second aspect is the fiscal squeeze. So the EU is increasingly spending a large amount of government revenue on care for older people, on pensions for older people. So we now have a ginormous pensions time bomb. Spain, instead of spending on flood defences, on green industrial policy has this massive growing pension time bomb, which is an ever larger share of GDP. Now how do we pay for an elderly population? Two ways: so one is that people . . . individuals may cut down on consumption to save more. In China, young people are reducing their consumption to save for retirement. Alternatively, young people like you and me will have to pay a higher rate of taxation to pay for our elderly workforce. Now those are relatively prosperous societies. What about the much, much poorer societies like Tamil Nadu, where fertility is now really low? So in Tamil Nadu, only 29 per cent of urban women are working. That means the average guy will be supporting two sets of elderly parents. That is an enormous burden on a young man’s shoulders. So right across the world, we’re dealing with an older population that is less dynamic, we’re cutting back on our consumption, we’ll be taxing our younger people less. So it really, really hurts everyone’s welfare. If you care about climate breakdown, if you want green industrial policy, you need money to spend on that strategy. And we’re short of it. John Burn-Murdoch
Right, and I guess you also need innovation. And as you say, older society is less innovative, they’re maybe not gonna come up with that next clean technology. And coming back to that economic point, I guess what we may be saying here is there’s a slight tension between people who say they’re concerned about whether it’s rising taxes or whether it’s about diminishing opportunities for younger people or the greater burden placed on younger people, they would say they’re concerned about that. But then if you mention birth rates, they say, oh no, that’s a conservative talking point. And what you’re saying is a lot of these things are related. And if people are concerned about the former, then this is a conversation they should be having or listening to. Alice Evans
Absolutely. So at the moment, the conversation of birth rates is sort of divided between conservatives and misogynists who blame childless cat ladies or progressives and liberals who just don’t want to touch it. And personally, as a social scientist, I think we should contribute to that public conversation. Work out what’s really going on so we can have an evidence-based strategy. John Burn-Murdoch
Absolutely. And then one other thing you’ve not mentioned, but I know you’ve written about in the past, is one of the other options available to these countries who are struggling with ageing and declining populations would be immigration. But I think you’ve had a look at the numbers involved there, and that perhaps if people think that even progressives who think that they would prefer that solution rather than trying to find some way to boost birth rates, that’s maybe not as easy a fix as people think. Alice Evans
Absolutely. So immigration can be a tremendous boon for innovation. As diverse people mix and mingle and share ideas. Now, Lant Pritchett was previously on this podcast with Martin Wolf said he expects that in order to maintain the working age population to population ratio, we would need up from around 2050 to have around 40 to 60 per cent of Europe and rich countries being migrants. Now that poses major challenges for integration, if not well handled. John Burn-Murdoch
And just to clarify that you’re saying 40 to 60 per cent of what number would need to be immigrants? Alice Evans
Sorry, of the population would need to be migrants, of Europe, would need to be migrants. John Burn-Murdoch
Remarkable. Alice Evans
Yeah. A massive, massive transformation which could cause social tensions or political backlash, which we’re already seeing now. It could be properly handled. It could be totally fine. In fact, there are many different ways in which we could avoid the challenges of low fertility. You know, maybe AI will generate tremendous advances in productivity. Maybe there are all sorts of ways we could skirt around the issue, but each of them have their own difficulties. John Burn-Murdoch
Absolutely. And I guess what we’re saying here is this has to be part of the conversation. Again, if the premise is that people don’t want these, you know, soaring tax rates and they do want the same level of public spending, pensions, healthcare, all of that to be maintained, then it’s pretty much impossible to do that if birth rates keep falling, or at least the solution are things that most people would not say are realistic. Alice Evans
Absolutely. So there is a trilemma. If you want a wealthy, prosperous Europe with a social safety net, you need to expand the working-age population. And that can come through migrants. That can come through fertility. John Burn-Murdoch
But I guess just on a very simple level, some of the societies that people look at and consider to be, you know, a bit older, a bit more stagnant, so I’m thinking, you know, I’m gonna generalise and stereotype, but Japan, Italy, for example, these are, you know, famously slow growth over, over the recent period of time. And I know a colleague of yours, someone we both know, Jesús Fernández-Villaverde. Alice Evans
Fernández-Villaverde John Burn-Murdoch
Yes, he did work on this showing that . . .  Alice Evans
He’s done tremendous work. So macroeconomics for the past 20 years have been puzzled. Why? What’s wrong with Japan’s economy? What’s wrong with their macro situation? And Jesús Fernández-Villaverde has looked into himself. If you look at the output per worker of the working-age population, Japan is doing totally fine. There’s nothing wrong with the average Japanese worker and their productivity. The issue is that there are fewer workers. They’re all getting much, much older. And older people like my grandmother are just economically inactive. And that tanks everyone down, right? That is the cause of Japan’s malaise. John Burn-Murdoch
I think you’ve made a strong case for why this is an important conversation to be having, regardless of what one’s other beliefs might be. So what are some of the standard theories for why this is happening and the way it’s happening? Alice Evans
OK, so let’s start with economics. So one idea is that as societies get richer, as we see skills-bias technological change, then parents invest more in the quality of each child. John Burn-Murdoch
Can we just spell out what we mean by skills biased technological change? Alice Evans
All right. OK. So as economies shift away from brawn, lifting up heavy rocks to, you know, using our skills and intellect, parents may decide, right, in order to maximise my opportunities or my children’s opportunities, I’m going to heavily invest in their education so they can capitalise on new jobs, right? So that was a standard theory of this quality-quantity trade-off. But that just doesn’t seem to hold because this fertility collapse is happening at all levels of income, right? So Tamil Nadu is much poorer than the UK but has exactly the same level of fertility. So it can’t just be about economic development. John Burn-Murdoch
So you mentioned that this idea of the quality-quantity trade-off. So the idea of having fewer kids but investing more time and resources into them as a parent, could you talk a bit more about that? And you know, what were the reasons people made those arguments in the first place? Is it that that’s not a thing, or is it just less a thing than people thought? Alice Evans
OK, so we also need to think about the costs of having children, both financially and emotionally. So when I did research in Hong Kong, in Korea last year, you know, women would say about how much they struggle to get their children into the very best kindergarten. Or in South Korea, they send their children to hagwons, private tuition ends at 10pm max camp. So parents all over the western world, in the US, in Europe, are spending much more, sort of what we call intensive parenting. Sort of maximising their children’s outcome. That’s costly. Rising house prices in London makes children more expensive. So cost is certainly a factor, but I don’t think it’s the primary driver because these things are happening everywhere all at once, even where those costs aren’t such a significant part of people’s consumption. John Burn-Murdoch
And on that, so I think it’s a really important point. I know I’ve also seen a bunch of studies where people are literally asked . . . prospective parents are asked, what are some of the things stopping you from having kids and living costs, housing costs, however defined, are always on that list. But they’re very, very, very rarely in the top two or three reasons. So I think it’s an important point to make that, you know, these things clearly matter on some level, but they don’t seem to be pivotal in this decision-making process. Is that fair? Alice Evans
I think an important distinction to make is that things can be bad and unpleasant for a whole host of other reasons, right? So I’m not here saying that high house prices in London aren’t the problem. High house prices are a problem. Living cost . . . the cost of living crisis is a problem. But that’s not necessarily the reason why people make fertility decisions. It’s not the cost of living crisis which explains why fertility is plummeting in the Guatemalan highlands. You know, they don’t have the Chelsea housing situation. John Burn-Murdoch
Yeah, that we know of. Well, you’ve probably been down on your travel schedule. Interesting. So, that’s sort of the direct economic and financial costs. Based on all your reading, your research, your interviews, what do you actually think is going on here? Alice Evans
I think a really important factor is the rise of singles worldwide. John Burn-Murdoch
And what do you mean there? So the rise of people who are single, not in relationships, that kind of thing? Alice Evans
Yeah, exactly. So right across the world, in the Middle East, in the Americas, in east Asia, soaring rates of people neither cohabiting nor being married. John Burn-Murdoch
And this, I guess, is an interesting addition to the traditional debate because we’ve been used to thinking . . . because this is what did happen. We’ve been used to thinking, well, what we’re looking at here is couples who are deciding not to have kids or to have kids later, whereas the data from the last decade or two is showing that it’s not that. It’s that people who are in married couples or in stable, long-term, cohabiting relationships are still having kids at the same rate as ever, it’s just that those relationships are fewer and further between that, they’re either not forming as at such higher rates or they’re dissolving more quickly. Alice Evans
Absolutely. So more young people are staying single or they’re marrying later. And if you marry later, that reproductive window is that much smaller. And so that limits the number of children you’re going to have, even if you do find a happy, loving, committed relationship. John Burn-Murdoch
And well, on that point, what is it that has changed in recent years? If we’re now moving away from why do people have or not have kids to why do they couple up or not couple up? And you mentioned there loving relationships, you have some theories here, right? For why we’ve seen these big sort of structural changes. Alice Evans
Absolutely. So let’s first of all think historically why was marriage so high historically? Two things: well, I think that people would have married for love, money or respect. So in socially conservative societies, is it absolutely a must to gain status and social inclusion to marry? So when I lived in Zambia for 18 months, people would continually pester me. Alice, when are you getting married? When are you getting married? When I was in Uzbekistan for a month last year, people would constantly say to me, Alice, are you married? That was the first thing people wanted to know about me. The primary most important aspect of my identity? Am I married or not? But with the exception of Uzbekistan and Zambia, what was the most downloaded song last year, John? You know this one? John Burn-Murdoch
Was it Miley Cyrus, Flowers? Alice Evans
Exactly. Exactly. Flowers, right? So this is a song celebrating, glorifying, saying that young women can buy themselves flowers. So as men and women’s earnings converge as societies liberalise or women sort of develop different ideas of their own, then they’ll be like, actually, no, you know, these guys don’t quite meet my aspirations and expectations. I’m going to be a little bit more selective. To quote Ariana Grande, ‘Thank U, Next.’ John Burn-Murdoch
So many pop culture references. This is unusual for this podcast, but I welcome it. But a question that you talked about a few different things there. So this, as you say, could be in an indirect way, economics. You know, if men’s relative economic status is perhaps diminishing and women’s is rising, maybe that means there are fewer of those sort of economically, financially convenient relationships, as you said, but there’s also this rapid spread of these values and culture. And I get loads of research showing there’s some really interesting stuff showing that when young women gain access to the internet, they have the spread of liberal ideals. Doesn’t happen to young men. Really interesting. Alice Evans
Absolutely. So in the US, in Europe, to a lesser extent, in south Asia, we do see economic convergence between young men and women. And as you yourself have shown in your excellent data analysis that especially for less educated men in Britain, women might even be earning more or more likely to be employed. So you might say that women just don’t have the economic need for men. That said, even in countries where female employment rates were very low, like much of north Africa, the Middle East and in South Korea — which has got the largest gender pay gaps in the world of over 30 per cent — we still see this massive plummeting of relationships. So it’s almost as if women are saying, even if I need to subsist on my smaller income or live with my parents, I’d rather do that because my values and aspirations are slightly different to my mother.  So what I suggest is going on is this term, which I call “cultural leapfrogging”. So right across the world we see this massive growth in access the internet and smartphones. Now once a woman has her own phone, she can, you know, dial in to whatever. And she enjoys this, this plethora of this amazing breadth of entertainment and media and stories, online literature. So women increasingly tell their own stories on Chinese literature city, and they get different ideas and their aspirations for relationships change. So in China and South Korea, women don’t necessarily want the same lives as their mothers. So, you know, in South Korea, a massive hit was Born 1982, which is all about the everyday sexism. So young women are increasingly rejecting that. So in my interviews in Morocco, in Turkey, in Mexico, women tell me that their favourite shows on Netflix might be The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, for example, or Emily in Paris, which is one of the ones I heard in Malaysia. So all these women can sort of tune into, you know, the western frontier of gender equality and think, hey, actually, I’d rather have that. So a couple of months ago in Malaysia, these young women were saying, you know, these men were uncomfortable with my autonomy and me being assertive and me saying what I wanted, and so actually, I decided that I deserved better and I wanted better, and I didn’t want to reduce my selves to placate their egos. So increasingly, young women are saying, I have different values, I have different aspirations, I’d rather be alone. John Burn-Murdoch
So I guess again, it’s about . . . It is sort of indirectly about that gap in values and goals and aspirations between young men and women or not the gap in their aspirations, but a gap in what they expect from each sex. And so in these countries where you’ve got the proliferation of new digital media and new western media, where you previously had young men and women in, let’s say, the Middle East, fairly aligned on what they thought their future looked like, a gap is now emerging. Alice Evans
So that’s one of the factors, absolutely. So it could be an ideological mismatch, but it can also be personality mismatches. So for example, you know in the past, you know, many women or men would have married people who are abusive, narcissistic, manipulative, aggressive, passive-aggressive. But now people might choose to be more selective. They might, you know, read romantic novels and think, actually, I want a man who adores me, who cares who me, who’s nice, who I enjoy spending time with. So even if they were sort of similar in ideology, we might dislike their personality. There’s no monocausal explanation about why people aren’t coupling up. You know, another possible factor is that as people spend more time on their phones, for instance, you know, it’s so enjoyable to just, you know, sit at home in your pyjamas. Or maybe I just speak to myself and, you know, browse the internet, chat to your friends instead of some low-effort socialising, low-effort entertainment. And so people socialise less. They’re not necessarily meeting people so much. You’ve got all these other alternatives. And the shame and stigma attached to being single totally declined. So whether it’s ideology, whether it’s personality or whether it’s just because you couldn’t be bothered to get dressed, people are staying alone. And that contributes to the rise of singles. Now, curiously, India actually has a stable rate of marriage. So here it’s not the rise of singles causing the decline in fertility. So why isn’t marriage falling across India? There are two possible hypotheses: one is that smartphone access is relatively recent in India. You know, its economic growth has really accelerated over the past 10, 15 years. But not long ago, very, very few women . . . it was 7 per cent in 2015 had mobile phone technology. So a related, a major issue in India and in south Asia more broadly is that there was a massive gender gap in smartphone ownership. So because male honour depends on female seclusion and the caste system motivates very tight policing of women’s whereabouts and mobility, families might deny women a phone. So the man might have a phone, but the woman won’t. So that means that women would be forced, or rather opt into watching media communally. So not necessarily eke out their own independent ideas on different media. So there is a gender gap in smartphone ownership and that could inhibit this “culture leapfrogging”. In addition to that, India’s economy is overwhelmingly run through caste lines. So when Indians want a job, access to a loan or even a new place to stay in the city, they might live near their kin or get a loan from their kin, or get help from their kin. They’re called jati and these jati networks are secured — these trusted networks of cooperation are secured by ensuring that girls, women marry within their jati. That is a way of consolidating these caste systems. So marriage remains vital. Marriage remains vital to the Indian economy, which is run around caste. Marriage secures these links. So we have two possibilities, right? It’s either that women weren’t able to do this cultural leapfrogging because they didn’t necessarily have phones until very recently, or it’s because caste is so important. Marriage is so important. It feeds into what I was saying earlier that the uncles and aunties are constantly saying, when are you getting married? When are you getting married? John Burn-Murdoch
Right. And also, I would guess, and you’ll know this better than I, that maybe the convergence in socio-economic fortunes of young men and women in India has been much more muted than elsewhere. So just from pure economic incentives of coupling up, it’s probably, I would imagine, much more of a no-brainer for a socio-economically lower status and sort of disempowered young women in India to just go into a relationship with a guy. Alice Evans
So that’s an interesting hypothesis. That said, let me . . . I will use your phrase, John, to put two wrinkles in that. So one is that Indian female higher education now outpaces men’s. So more women are in university than men in India. In Himachal Pradesh, the gender ratio is actually equal to that of the US 1.4. So women are increasingly educated. So they could conceivably choose to be single and get their own jobs. Moreover, India’s rate of female labour force participation is 37 per cent, which is actually above parts of the Middle East and north Africa. So it can’t be economics alone that explains why marriage is plummeting in the Middle East and north Africa, but not in south Asia. So that’s why I’m more sort of open to this caste-based hypothesis that the economy is run on caste and you just have to get married is one possibility. John Burn-Murdoch
Fascinating. Absolutely fascinating. This is why I always love chatting to you. So, one of the things I must ask on this topic of the rising rates of singledom or lower rates of relationship formation, however, we want to think about it is. There’s a stereotype I hear a lot at least, is that a lot of this is your Emily-in-Paris type situation, or your Sex-in-the-City type situation. This is smart, well-educated young women. A lot of options open to them who are, you know, they’re just not finding a good enough partner or, you know, their careers and lives are giving them a lot of fulfilment that they don’t necessarily want to put on the back burner. Is that borne out in the data when we look at who is not coupling up? Alice Evans
OK. Great question. So first and foremost, as female education massively outpaces men’s, we might expect that university-educated women struggle to find an equally educated man. That said, when we look at the data of both marriage and fertility, it is the most deprived men, the most socio-economically disadvantaged, who are really struggling to find wives and girlfriends. And that holds in the US, it holds in Finland and it holds in South Korea. So the men who can’t attract, right? So if you don’t have a system of arranged marriages, then you’ve got to use your charm, your wits, your wealth, your status to impress the ladies and the men at the back of the list are really struggling. John Burn-Murdoch
And of course, you know, wherever there’s a low-status man, not in a couple, there’s a low-status woman, not in a couple. So the overarching point here is that if some people listens to this and think, oh, you know, the rise of single people is just social progress. These are people with, you know, high disposable incomes living very fulfilling lives. Sure, there is some of that. But the main trend here is people at the bottom end of society who for all of these various reasons, are not finding the stability in the relationships that they would have done in the past. Alice Evans
Absolutely. And I’m so glad you raised that, John, because I think it’s a serious and important point, you know. So one might think that it’s the Miley Cyrus or the Taylor Swift’s that are single. No, Taylor Swift is like, got like her alpha male boyfriend who’s championing her and supporting her. The real crisis and the reason why all of this really, really matters from a liberal, progressive perspective, is it is the most disadvantaged people who are struggling to find love, to build families, to have fulfilment. And it’s these groups which are struggling from an epidemic of loneliness, of feeling unwanted and are and maybe historically, you know, some progressive forces would have sort of laughed at incels or mocked those kinds of guys, you know, typing behind their computers, left alone. But it’s a really sad development. You know, the feeling of being unwanted, the feeling of being . . . that no one values you, that no one appreciates you, that women just won’t give you the time of day. This is feeding frustrations and it has real political consequences. John Burn-Murdoch
And again, it may be men who are on, you could say the sharp end of this or here is at the heart of this, but the result of that is large numbers of single people, therefore having to survive of one income where they would have done of two, both men and women. Alice Evans
Yeah, absolutely. So actually, you know, I’d like to hear more about working-class men because they’ve had such a hard time. So one is they’ve been hit by automation. So as automation hits jobs in manual labour, in construction, in manufacturing, then the demand for those jobs has totally decimated, the pay for those jobs has totally decimated. Meanwhile, men are struggling to progress in education, so they remain much more vulnerable so . . . the least educated remain much more vulnerable to all those economic shocks. And then they’re unable to get a girlfriend. So you’re unable to progress economically and you’re unable to progress romantically. So yeah, this is a massive, massive issue for much of the world that has a premium on skills. John Burn-Murdoch
Right. So you’ve got these big sweeping global economic shifts happening over decades and then there’s sort of the light that’s applied to that kindling is then the spread of digital media, changing attitudes, the rise in the sense that women can actually look at those trends if they’re aware of them and say, yeah, this isn’t a good deal for me any more. Alice Evans
Yeah, absolutely. So it should not surprise anyone when men who feel economically disadvantaged, struggling in numerous ways, struggling to get a girlfriend, and then meanwhile they hear a lot, you know, progressives championing women saying, you know, we’ve got to support women. We’ve got to have our women-only team. We’re so proud of feminist advances. These men are like, you know, but what about us when we’re not getting anything? And so those men who feel very neglected are now gravitating to voices that will give them status, that will give them authority, whether that’s the AfD, the far-right, Reform or Trump, right? Because no one else is giving them the time of day, and I’m not justifying any of that, but you can understand, you know, how everything we talked about today has serious political consequences. John Burn-Murdoch
Exactly, exactly. It’s just we start talking about birth rates. You end up with something much, much, much broader. OK, Alice, fantastic stuff. Really enjoying this. But we’re gonna take a little break. And when we come back, let’s move on to what happens next. Should something be done about this and if so, what? [MUSIC PLAYING] OK, we’re back. Alice, I want to move this on to throw it forward. Now, I guess there’s two parts to this question. First is all of these big shifts, which as we talked about, you know, it’s not that they are capital B bad, but there are certainly some negative repercussions and implications. Is this something that governments, policymakers, etc should be doing anything about? And then I guess the second part, which we can come on to afterwards, is what might that be? What might work? What might not work? Alice Evans
OK. So let’s handle that maybe in three parts. I guess the first question is political and ethical. So we might think that as a liberal society should we tell people what to do? And you know, I think for most of our listeners that would feel kind of repugnant, right? But we do need to grapple with the two facts, the economic implications, that this is a pensions time bomb and that many people are unhappy. They’re lonely, right? So we do have some kind of issue that we might want to think about. So then the next question is, well, what the hell do we do about it? And I think the first and most important thing to recognise is that the standard fixes are incredibly inadequate. John Burn-Murdoch
So when you say standard fixes, what are we talking about there? Alice Evans
So baby bonuses. So giving people whether it’s in Finland, you know, a baby package, you know congratulations or whether it’s a New York universal pre-K, pre-kindergarten or Korea, all kinds of cash incentives to have children, also tried in China. The evidence, the academic evidence from around the world is that none of this works. It makes zero difference. Really little difference. John Burn-Murdoch
I’m gonna call you on that one, because I’ve been called out on saying that before. I think what we’re saying is it’s not that it makes zero difference, but you’ve basically got a downward-sloping line. And what a policy, what policies like these do is they might move that line very slightly upwards. So, a few people might have kids that they weren’t going to have, but mainly it’s either people just banking that bonus to have a kid they were gonna have anyway, or it’s like we say it’s shifting the line upwards, but it’s not changing the direction. So these things, it’s not that they quote unquote don’t work, but they are inadequate in the face of everything else we’ve been taught. Alice Evans
You’re right that I should be more careful. So, for example, I’ve just come back from Hungary and they gave people who wanted to marry and have children, cheaper mortgages. And that was trialled for a couple of years. It led to an increase in marriage and fertility. Then they would draw it and plummeted again, became more expensive. So you could give people thousands and thousands of pounds to have children. You could massively increase the amount of money. And maybe if it was sufficiently high, you could induce people to have children. Maybe it’s just a matter of volume. You know, throw cash at people and eventually they’ll start procreating. But I think it’s relatively second order and minor relative to the primary driver, and it puts the cart before the horse if people are not coupling up in the first place. Because having your children is so emotionally and financially costly, very few women now want to do it alone, and very few men want to do it alone. And if you’re not in a couple, You just have these massive, massive frictions that aren’t going to be solved with cheaper childcare. And so while cheaper childcare and better houses are great, and I fully support that, those dividends just don’t deal with the elephant in the room, which is the loneliness, right? John Burn-Murdoch
I guess this goes back to what we were saying earlier. Like, if you think about if you conceptualise falling birth rates as an issue of couples sitting around deciding to not have or delay having kids, then of course, giving those couples money to incentivise them to have kids or giving them a bigger house in some way or another would help. But if we are actually talking about the fact that there are fewer couples, there are more people out there on their own, whether they’re living on the right or living with their parents, what’s the baby bonus gonna do to those people, right? So we have to almost reframe how we think that’s entirely. Alice Evans
Right, absolutely. If you’re a single man and someone gives you £10,000 to have a kid, what do you do? Right? It’s just a, you know, these academic debates are quite slightly disconnected from many people’s reality. You know, the primary concern for many people in their 20s are dating struggles. That’s why people are constantly talking about dating apps. But in reality, it’s not the apps that are problem, it’s people. John Burn-Murdoch
Right. Well, this comes on to my next point. If those things don’t work or they’re relatively ineffective, what would work? I mean, do we want government-sponsored speed dating? That doesn’t sound like something that is gonna be hugely popular. Alice Evans
I think going back to my previous point, I think we have a real struggle in a liberal society where we have the most advanced technology in the world that makes spending time at home alone so much more pleasurable, right? And initially, that’s very easy and everyone else is doing it, so there’s no shame or stigma. But as we all select into our own lonely echo chambers, we drift further and further apart. And so for me, I do think it’s really important to build social infrastructure and to strengthen social skills. John Burn-Murdoch
Right. And I guess again, it’s all about if we think about this in terms of being downstream of couples formation, if you think that what we really need to do is just have more people in relationships, again, we’re not talking here about arranged marriages or anything of the sort, but if at some level, relationship formation is a function of how many interactions you are having with people, then a world where there are fewer of those interactions, especially face to face, you get fewer relationships, you get fewer kids, you get all these issues we’re talking about. So any change in society which put more people in front of each other face to face, whether, you know, reversing some of the work-from-home trends, like you say, people spending less time on digital media, whether that’s Netflix or on their smartphone, these you might not think of policies like these as being about relationships and birth rates, but they may have an impact simply mechanistically, by having more interaction between young men and women or people of the same sex. Alice Evans
Yeah. I mean, let me stress that I, you know, I’m a card-carrying liberal. I grew up with, you know, texts like John Stuart Mill and, you know, I fully endorse that. But the problem is that if people can choose, then they might choose the easiest option, which is staying at home. Let me give you an example. Back ten years ago, I used to train in the gym with a bunch of guys like really rowdy, a bunch guys and was super fun. We’d all chat. But now when I go into gyms, everyone is on their mobile phones. Very few people are chatting to their neighbours when they’re queueing for stuff. John Burn-Murdoch
So it sounds like, you know, a lot of where we’ve ended up has been from fairly organic shifts in the world and in different parts of the world, not really any kind of policy change or certainly not anything with these sort of goals, which makes it hard to reverse this. But if you did have a magic wand and you could wave that wand and change one thing, maybe and maybe for the world as a whole, maybe for one part of the world to reverse some of these trends, what would that be? Alice Evans
I think having a sort of a common standard school system is super, super important. I think having a curriculum that everyone can get on board with, you know, not something that is so conservative or so progressive that it alienates or triggers a backlash. I think we want to restore a social fabric whereby people come to bond, empathise with each other and have the social skills to make jokes and to charm each other. And so schools are one way that might happen, especially if you remove smartphones. Get young people hanging out, making jokes and having fun. John Burn-Murdoch
OK, so something that happens at young age and smartphones probably being a key part of it. Alice Evans
Yeah. John Burn-Murdoch
OK. Alice, thank you. Alice Evans
John, this has been an absolute pleasure. Thank you so much. [MUSIC PLAYING] John Burn-Murdoch
That is all for this week. You’ve been listening to The Economics Show from the Financial Times. This episode was produced by Edith Rousselot with original music from Breen Turner. It is edited by Bryant Urstadt. Our executive producer is Manuela Saragosa. Cheryl Brumley is the FT’s global head of audio. I’m John Burn-Murdoch. Thanks for listening.",2025-02-23,This is an audio transcript of The Economics Show podcast episode,"In the latest episode of The Economics Show podcast, John Burn-Murdoch discusses the significant decline in birth rates globally, with record lows in countries like England, Wales, and the United States, as well as even lower rates in developing countries like Turkey and Mexico. Dr. Alice Evans, a social scientist, explains that this decline is caused by a variety of factors, including economic changes and societal shifts towards increased rates of singlehood.

Evans outlines two primary economic concerns associated with falling birth rates: the ""pensions time bomb,"" where an aging population places pressure on younger generations to support elderly care, and a reduction in economic dynamism due to fewer young people entering the workforce. This decline can lead to lower innovation and increased financial burdens on individuals, further impacting consumption and public welfare.

Key theories for the decreasing birth rates include rising costs of raising children and changes in relationship dynamics. Many young people are delaying or opting out of marriage and childbearing, with singles becoming more prevalent. In particular, Evans notes that women worldwide are gaining independence, leading to changes in relationship expectations and a decrease in traditional roles.

Importantly, standard policy suggestions, like financial incentives for childbirth, have shown limited effectiveness. Instead, Evans highlights the need for fostering social interactions and skills through initiatives such as improved schooling that encourages personal relationships and emotional connections, tackling loneliness and promoting family formation.

Overall, the conversation stresses the broad implications of a declining birth rate, linking it to economic dynamics and societal structure rather than simply individual choices. Evans advocates for a more nuanced and open dialogue to address these complex issues effectively."

Martin Sandbu
One of the biggest geopolitical questions of the moment is the war in Ukraine and how to stop it. A big part of the answer to that is what economic pressure or what economic concessions could change Russia’s calculations. Vladimir Putin claims that his economy is strong and sanctions have failed. But what is propaganda and what is reality? Today on the show, we’re going to try to find out what is really going on in Russia’s economy.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

This is The Economics Show. I’m Martin Sandbu, and joining me in the studio is Sergei Guriev, dean of London Business School and economic adviser to Russian opposition figures. Sergei, welcome to the show.

Sergei Guriev
Thank you very much, Martin, for inviting me.

Martin Sandbu
Sergei, you are a Russian native. You are also a French citizen now. It’s been a while since you’ve been able to go back to your native country, isn’t it?

Sergei Guriev
That’s right. I had to leave Russia in 2013, where people close to Vladimir Putin suggested that I should buy a one-way ticket as soon as possible. That’s what I did. The next day I left Russia. Since then, I actually visited Russia three times. Each time it was a couple of days when I was a chief economist of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. I had some kind of diplomatic immunity, so I thought that it would be safe and it was actually safe. The last time I was in Russia physically was 2018.

Martin Sandbu
And I should have mentioned that one of your credentials is that you were the chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development before your recent academic positions.

Sergei, you are also a friend and you were an adviser to Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny, and you’re friends with his family. Could you tell us a bit about your relationship with them?

Sergei Guriev
Yes, I know Alexei Navalny. I’ve known Alexei Navalny since 2008 when he was a corporate activist fighting corruption . . . 

Martin Sandbu
Anti-corruption activist . . . 

Sergei Guriev
. . . anti-corruption activist in state companies. I was a board member in Sberbank at that point and then together we tried to improve corporate governance in Sberbank. I should say the management was open to that. And since then we’ve been in touch. We talked a lot. I would indeed say that we were friends. I know his kids, Zakhar and Dasha. I know his wife, and we’ve been in touch and we continue to be in touch with the family. Alexei was a unique leader, somebody who worked really hard. He understood what he wants to achieve and he was very committed and fearless in this effort. And unfortunately, he paid for his idealism with his life.

Martin Sandbu
And he died Friday exactly a year ago, as we are recording this. You advised him on economics. So let us talk about your insights into the Russian economy. As I mentioned in the introduction, Putin has trumpeted some good numbers to basically prove that the west is powerless to affect mighty Russia, the economy is resilient and to generally try to instil both at home, I think, and abroad this message of strength. You have obviously studied the economy for a long time. You will have insights from contacts back in the country. Tell us what is really going on.

Sergei Guriev
So Putin is not wrong if you look at official numbers. I think these numbers reflect the national accounts. It’s an economics show, so let me walk you through how we measure GDP in a country at war, which is very different from a country at peace. So GDP measures value added. So if you have government procurement, we usually measure those goods that the government buys and the cost that the government is charged. So when the government buys, say, a billion-dollars worth of tanks, that’s addition to GDP of a billion dollars. Now, these tanks are burnt in Ukrainian fields. It doesn’t seem like a good value added for the Russian economic performance. It’s actually equivalent to government just printing this billion dollars and handing over to those people who work in the tank factory or their shareholders without producing anything. So on paper, it looks like Russia is actually producing a lot of GDP, but a lot of those GDP are soldiers who are killed in Ukraine or wounded in Ukraine with their families getting cash or weapons producers, munitions producers who seem like contributing to GDP. But actually this contribution is not very important.

Now, a lot of economic growth is explained by this. So if you just look at one particular budget item, which is defence spending, it went up from about 3 per cent of GDP to almost 7 per cent of GDP. So that per se is a major increase in spending. But then of course, there are other industries like producing goods and services, transportation for the army. And a lot of that is outside of this narrowly defined defence spending. So if you identify industries related to the war, as some analysts are doing, eventually the story is all the growth is concentrated in the military sector. And now the question is who pays for that?

And of course, Russia still has sovereign wealth fund. The liquid part of this fund is smaller and smaller. It’s now standing at about 2 per cent of GDP. So it’s literally, you can say, one year of budget deficit away.

On the other hand, Russia is also using inflation. As I said, when you print money to give it to families of soldiers who were killed or to soldiers themselves, it’s equivalent to just what economists love to say, helicopter money, right, to just inject newly printed money into the economy that leads to inflation. Because when you hand this money to soldiers’ families, nothing is produced. And so there is more cash for the same output produced in the economy. So that raises inflation. And not surprisingly, interest rates are very high. Now, the Central Bank of Russia decided not to increase interest rates in February, but it still stands at 21 per cent. Right? This is a big, big number that shows that central bank is really worried about inflation. And when you actually talk to people on the ground, they don’t believe official inflation numbers. And again, I am not saying that Russian official statistics is lying, but a lot of things you can mismeasure in a country at war. The reason for that is what we call quality adjustment. So you come to the shop and you buy lower-quality goods that used to be cheaper.

Martin Sandbu
For example?

Sergei Guriev
Think about cars, right? Cars are probably the most visible example. Russia used to consume European cars or European cars or Japanese cars assembled in Russia. And Russia would also buy Chinese cars, but the price of Chinese cars would be 30 to 50 per cent lower. So now you buy Chinese cars and most of the cars are Chinese, right? You buy Chinese cars at the price of German cars. For Russian official statistics, there is no inflation. One car, same price. But actually there is a lot of inflation because if you look at models, makes, one for one, the prices have increased by tens of per cents and in some cases doubled. So a lot of inflation is actually not taken into account, not because the Russian official statistics are lying, but actually it’s very hard to track the price increase adjusted for quality when you have such a huge transformation because Russian consumption portfolio has changed dramatically in those three years.

Martin Sandbu
Let’s go back to the numbers of the cost of the war, because I see a lot of people here focus on the budgetary numbers. And that’s where you started as well. But I always find it useful as an economist to kind of go back and think about the real resources that are being put in, whether those are raised through some sort of inflation tax, actual public spending, printing money or some off-balance sheet thing. In the end, there have to be real resources devoted to making tanks, making guns, feeding soldiers, transporting them and so on, and transporting their corpses back, all the things of war. Do we have a handle on how much of the Russian economy, in real terms, is now devoted to fighting and trying to oppress Ukraine?

Sergei Guriev
So nobody knows. Sometimes you see estimates which just add up this line item, which I mentioned defence spending, but also law enforcement spending. Once you add up those two things, you end up in the range of 10 per cent of GDP. But the number may actually be higher. Nobody’s saying that Russia is as militarised as Soviet Union. This debate is very important, by the way. Why? Because when cold war ended and Soviet Union drastically demilitarised, that hit the aggregate economy a lot because the defence sector was such a big part of the Soviet economy. Some estimates would say that it was up to 20 per cent of GDP. And so early 1990s, recession was a big shock for the whole economy and . . . 

Martin Sandbu
Because nothing replaced that spending.

Sergei Guriev
Exactly, exactly. You have to go through very painful restructuring, reskilling the defence workers to do something else, services. It takes time and effort. And now there are worries that Putin doesn’t want to negotiate because he’s worried about postwar recession. But again, as I would say is first and foremost, Russians know how to live in the economy in peace. So this is recent memory and also this size of the military economy is probably half of what it used to be in Soviet times. And it’s also a market economy. So adjustment will be easier. But this is a very important conversation.

Now, one thing which people sometimes say is the whole Russia is working for this war, Russians like this war because they benefit from the war. This is, I think, an exaggeration. If you look at how many families have been involved in the war, we are still talking about single-digit millions of people in the country, which is 140mn.

Martin Sandbu
But Sergei, there must be a lot of redistribution going on here because we have heard about very high wage increases for people in weapons-related manufacturing. We know, of course, there are big wage premia for recruitment when they’re trying to mobilise or avoid compulsory mobilisation. But of course, if real resources are limited and we’ll talk a bit more about those limits in a second, that means other people are getting less either because they are not getting the wage increases and inflation is driving prices up or because they are outright losing somehow. What picture do you have of that?

Sergei Guriev
Right. Martin I really like your focus on the real cost and not monetary cost and not nominal variables. Indeed, if you think about this, we move resources to the military economy, which produces something which brings zero value to the Russian population. These tanks are being burnt in Ukraine. They don’t create value within Russia. And so basically the cost comes through different channels. First, indeed, you need to run your military factories 24/7, which means you need to pay a lot of wages there, which means civilian companies have to pay higher wages. They are actually short of labour. We are not even talking about people who have left, which is probably another 1 or 2 per cent of labour force. Right? But again, probably 1 per cent of labour force, maybe 2 per cent of labour force, are directly involved in the hostilities in Ukraine. Right? So these are big numbers. So not surprisingly, unemployment is at 2 per cent. Very low unemployment. Sometimes Mr Putin is proud of that. You were talking about propaganda. Putin sometimes says we are very happy that unemployment is low, but it’s actually a signal that civilian sector is very short on labour. This is one channel.

The other channel is cost of capital. So central bank is increasing interest rate to fight inflation. Who is suffering from that? Military sector doesn’t suffer because military production is actually prepaid in the beginning of the year, they don’t need to borrow. Sometimes you hear that even military producers complain about high interest rates. But this is the export-import of Russian military complex. The Ukraine war-related part of military economy gets prepaid in January.

Martin Sandbu
Can I just ask you about that? Because this, I think, refers to something quite a lot of people were picking up on, which was that the boss of Rostec, the weapons manufacturer — Chemezov, I think, is his name — was complaining that this was making weapons manufacturing unprofitable. And you are saying he was referring to the export business. But that means, doesn’t it, that somehow the war is cannibalising what used to be a profitable export business. And if you go as far as having to reduce your profitable exports, it must be that you are coming up against constraints. Is that the right way to think about?

Sergei Guriev
Absolutely. And the whole civilian economy has to pay higher interest rates. And they are screaming. They’re saying that those interest rates are killing us. But they forget that the whole idea of higher interest rates is to cool down the economy. Which part of the economy has to be cooled down? The civilian one, because Putin wants to run the military economy at 24/7. So this is the redistribution from civilian normal economy towards military economy.

There is another redistribution that you referred to in passing, which is redistribution towards poorer part of the Russian population. So the way Putin recruits soldiers, he pays higher salaries and he targets poorer regions where those salaries are multiples of average salary in the region, in some case 10 times the average salary in the region. And so in a sense, his cynical idea is Russians were very poor and these are the families I’m going to target, because for those families, these are the amounts they’ve never seen before, it will never see in the future. And this is so painful for me as somebody who was born in Russia, because if you think about this, this redistribution is actually progressive redistribution. Could Putin have done that without the war? And the answer is yes. You just give this cash to poor parts of Russia without sending these individuals to be killed in Ukraine and kill Ukrainians. This whole redistribution project would have proceeded without the war. Putin did have the money. And so this is an extremely painful thought.

Martin Sandbu
It’s a very morbid kind of levelling up, to be a little too glib about it. And it strikes me from what you were saying that the other thing Putin or his economic managers are doing is to show that crude war Keynesianism works. You can actually mobilise all the resources inside your country if you are determined as a state to do it. But at some point you come up at limits in terms of your domestic resources. And I suppose that’s where we are, right? That’s why you see these inflationary pressures and the need to increase interest rates.

Sergei Guriev
Let me just say one thing about Keynes, right? Your co-host on this show is Soumaya Keynes, who I think is a relative of John Maynard Keynes. So Keynesianism is about an economy which has slack. So indeed, the whole idea is to spend a lot to eliminate unemployment, bring the economy closer to full employment, but then stop. Otherwise you do have inflation. You do have labour shortages. And in this case, military Keynesianism is a misnomer in the sense that Keynes is insulted. His idea was to restore full employment and not to create inflation. And here we have in Russia, we have the opposite phenomenon where you push it too far, exactly because you want to have full employment in the military sector. But that also creates this (inaudible) constraints and inflation and very, very low unemployment.

Martin Sandbu
There have been some reports out there suggesting that quite a bit of the war is also financed in sort of off-balance sheet credit. I wrote my last column about Russia on this. And you know, with the irresponsible license of a columnist, I said it shows that Russia’s economy is a house of cards, which you should be very free to disagree with. But on the substance, is there a lot of financing going on through the sort of private banking system? How significant is that and what are the vulnerabilities that that may create?

Sergei Guriev
I think this debate still continues, and I think you’re referring to Craig Kennedy who is a great and thoughtful analyst of Russian economy, especially of sanctions and energy sanctions in particular. I’m very proud to have worked with Craig on the design of Russian oil sanctions. But this debate on off-balance sheet financing is actually continuing because some numbers he’s given are very hard to verify. And the most important part of his argument is that the government will at some point, will bail out those loans, which is hard to predict whether government will or will not do that.

So as I said and you said that in real terms, what matters is the aggregate real cost of the war, which is very significant. And this inflation is already bringing in, of those costs. So, yes, Putin is very innovative and sophisticated in financing this war. And I would like to disagree with your statement that this is a house of cards in the following way.

So if you are in a democratic country and you have economic pressures like this, people will take to the street. In Russia, they would not. Russia was not a paragon of democracy before 2022 and even before 2014. In the end of the day, as I mentioned, I had to leave in 2013 not because I wanted to. But today it’s a qualitatively different level of repression. And even though Russians are suffering from high inflation, from a decline in purchasing power of their salaries, these are real effects, but Russians don’t take to the street because they’re afraid. And in that sense, Putin’s financing model is not about saying, OK, I run out of cash, I stop the war. His idea is, OK, I run out of cash, so I will raise taxes. I will reduce pensions in real terms. I will reduce salaries of doctors and teachers in real terms. And I hope that they will not overthrow me. And I will, of course, never reduce salaries of my right police. And so when this thing breaks, we don’t know.

The economy is facing constraints. So one important indication is that this year he raised taxes by about one percentage point of GDP, which is not a trivial amount. He has never done that before. Sometimes he would raise taxes in 25 years in power, but by very small amounts. This time he had to raise taxes significantly because he is facing budget constraints. And the west, of course, has a lot of instruments to increase this pain. And of course, when you raise taxes, it slows down economic growth. It also makes a lot of people unhappy. But as long as you can rely on your right police and KGB, you can afford that.

Martin Sandbu
And I suppose inside of that, there are economic policy choices to make about how you balance the various ways of extracting resources where you don’t need to have them that causes the least political risk. But I want to add one question to this, because we’ve talked about the domestic constraints. Of course, Russia is a surplus economy still, and it’s traditionally very much financed by natural resource exports. Those export earnings have gone down because of sanctions. Imports have been limited or become more costly also because of sanctions. It’s still a surplus economy. So I would like you to explain to me how if you’re in a . . . you’re trying to run a war, you are running up against domestic constraints, you shouldn’t really be running a surplus, right? You would want to spend all your earnings to import whatever it is you need, either directly for the war or to substitute for domestic resources. How should we understand the fact that Russia still has a smaller but still an external surplus?

Sergei Guriev
I love this question because right now there is a lot of debate about trade surpluses. In the biggest economy in the world, the United States, there is a debate to what extent we should fight trade surpluses with trade instruments. And the consensus on macroeconomics is trade deficit is a capital account surplus. And this is what we teach. If you have a flexible exchange rate, if everybody wants to send their capital to you, your currency appreciates to the extent that you run a trade deficit. And this is exactly what’s happening in the US, which is importing capital and running trade deficit because it is actually a wonderful destination for investment, in relative terms at least.

And this is the opposite of what we see in Russia. The fact that Russia is running a current account surplus is a reflection of the fact that Russia is exporting capital. This is as simple as that. So if Russia improves its investment climate, the rouble will strengthen and Russia will run a smaller surplus. However, we are where we are, and Russia is exporting almost 200bn worth of oil every year. And this is a lot of money. And of course, Putin wants to import technology and this is where our sanctions limit his capacity to do that. First and foremost, as you rightly said, sanctions do reduce inflow of petrodollars. In some years, the impact would be in the range of $50bn per year, which is 3 per cent of GDP. Now it’s probably closer to 20, as Putin has learned how to circumvent sanctions and 20 is like 1 per cent of GDP. So it’s not that big, unfortunately. Now, new sanctions which were introduced in the end of the Biden administration, supported by sanctions from the UK side and European side, create additional tension. So hopefully Putin will get even less of influx of petrodollars, but it is what it is.

Now the other question is can Putin use those to buy? And this is where sanctions, technological sanctions introduced in the very first months of the war and then tightened and strengthened later and later on, limit his capacity to buy advanced technology in the west. China also is told by western allies it should not supply military technology to Russia. And my understanding is that indeed Putin cannot get everything he wants from China because of the threat of secondary sanctions. Now, Putin circumvents those sanctions. He finds loopholes. And this is where a lot of sanctions enforcement matters. Where those loopholes are identified, often they’re identified thanks to wonderful investigative journalists, including Financial Times, which writes about stories how Russian intermediaries buy through third countries, fourth countries, fifth countries, buy military technology in the west. These individuals then are sanctioned themselves. And this is a cat-and-mouse game where each new loophole being closed results in another loophole which is more and more expensive. So Putin tries to import stuff, but there are huge transactional costs being created by sanctions.

Martin Sandbu
We’re going to have a very quick break. But when we return, I will ask Sergei what options western countries have to increase this economic pressure on Russia that we’ve just talked about. What may happen if they don’t or reduce it. And also, what his work on autocratic political systems teach us about what might happen next in both Moscow and Washington DC.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

And we’re back with Sergei Guriev to talk about the Russian economy. Before the break, Sergei, we talked about how sanctions seem to be having an effect on limiting the options that Putin have that’s sometimes not fully appreciated in the west. If we look forward now, what are the sort of policy decisions that could be taken by the coalition, the sanctioning coalition, if we wanted to increase the pressure on Putin?

Sergei Guriev
I think the way you formulate the question is exactly right, because sometimes people are saying sanctions are not working, sanctions are not important because the war is continuing. But we should not compare the impact of sanctions on Putin’s economy with what we would like to see but with the real counterfactual, what would have happened without sanctions? And I would remind the listeners that, well, Russia lost access to $300bn of sovereign reserves. With a $300bn in his pockets, Putin would have hired a lot more soldiers and bought a lot more North Korean munitions. Putin also is facing difficulties, as I mentioned before, in accessing western advanced technology. With unrestricted access to global markets, Putin would have bought a lot more military stuff. So I think by now the outcome of the war would be very different if not for the sanctions.

And finally, as I said, and you mentioned that in your question, Putin is getting a lot of petrodollars. This is what brings him foreign currency and this is what brings him cash in real terms as well. You quite rightly said we need to focus on the real variables. And so this is the main battleground right now. So the oil sanctions were only introduced in December 2022, February 2023 in Europe. US and UK embargoed Russian oil right away in the spring 2022.

Martin Sandbu
But they were not big importers.

Sergei Guriev
Exactly. They were not big importers. These were the European sanctions that mattered. And initially, the sanctions had a big effect. As I said, we were talking, in 2023, we were talking about 3 per cent of GDP that Putin lost. But then Putin built this shadow tanker fleet, and it’s only in 2024 the west started to work on that. Hundreds of ships were actually sanctioned. And this is a very innovative tool. I should say I’m really impressed by the sanctioning coalition, how many sanctions, but also how innovative solutions, how innovative the solutions were designed and introduced. And during the last couple of years, one of those were actually sanctioning individual vessels. By now, I think about 300 vessels are sanctioned by Europe, US, UK or both, or the whole three, and that limits Putin’s capacity to export oil. Of course, he buys new shadow fleet tankers. And the battleground here is exactly to track down those tankers, sanction the tankers, also check if the tankers are complying with the oil price cap, which is $60 per barrel.

Now, the debate is whether Europe can check the vessels in the Danish straits. In theory, Europe cannot because these are international waters and everybody has a right of passage. But apparently the idea is to offer conducting a check. And if the vessel declines this offer, then the vessel will be just sanctioned. So you cannot force the inspection, but you can propose an inspection on a voluntary basis. So these are the debates which are taking place right now. The most important debate is actual enforcement of sanctions and tracking down sanctions evasion that I mentioned.

Martin Sandbu
So this is about stopping or blocking, plugging loopholes. It’s about enforcing better. It’s basically about putting more resources into implementation. Are there also further steps, new sanctions or tightening of existing sanctions that we should be considering, or which are the most promising places to look at?

Sergei Guriev
So pretty much everything is already on the table. And indeed, the question is about enforcement. So from the very beginning of oil price cap, I insisted that we should reduce the oil price cap from 60 to 55 to 50. You know, the whole idea of oil price cap is we want Russian oil to be present on the market. So there is no global energy crisis. But we want Russia to be deprived of oil revenues. So Russia can still export at 60, its above marginal cost. Russia can still export at the price of 55 or 50. Maybe at 40, Russia will start closing down oilfields. But in order to move from 60 to 55, we need to first enforce 60. And this is not done yet. I think this is very (inaudible). And if you do that slowly and steadily, first you don’t create a crisis. If you move from 60 to 55, it’s unlikely that Russia stops exporting everything it does. And second, if you do implement this policy slowly and steadily, you also send a signal that if your economy’s struggling now, wait for half a year when we move $5 lower.

Martin Sandbu
What about gas? Europe is still buying liquefied natural gas from Russia.

Sergei Guriev
These are small fish. Right? So gas is much less important to Russia than oil. And LNG, liquefied natural gas, is much less important to Russia than pipeline. And Europe’s imports of Russian gas have come down by a factor of four or five. So it’s really not a very important source of revenue. The main battleground is oil.

Martin Sandbu
And what about financial sanctions, Sergei? There are at least two questions here. One is that there are still banking channels that are on sanctions. Some of those have to do with facilitating the energy trade. And then, of course, there’s the big outstanding questions of the immobilised state reserves, the foreign exchange reserves, perhaps 300bn or thereabouts, mostly in Europe. What is your view on the debate about whether those should be transferred outright as a downpayment on compensation to Ukraine?

Sergei Guriev
I think on the last question I’m in favour and I was in favour of using those resources for compensating Ukraine. We wrote a report on the reconstruction of Ukraine already in March-April 2022, with a group of CEPR economists, including Yuriy Gorodnichenko and several former IMF chief economists. So we are in favour. I’m in favour of transferring those resources, but it’s not clear whether you can legally do it right away.

Martin Sandbu
This is an economics podcast, so I’ll leave the legal issues to one side. But there’s an economic argument or financial argument that’s often made against, which is that this would lead to financial instability and in particular for euro instruments. The European Central Bank has been quite vocal in its opposition on the basis of that argument. What do you think?

Sergei Guriev
The European Central Bank’s job is to protect the stability of euro, minimise every possible risk. And indeed, if you weaponise euro like the US has weaponised dollar in the last decades, that of course creates an additional risk. But currently I don’t think we have credible competitors to dollar and euro as international reserve currency. And also not every country in the world wants to start such a big bloody war. So when we say, well, if you confiscate Russian assets, somebody else in this world will say, we’ll never store anything in Europe any more, well, people who are going to start a big bloody war, like the war in Ukraine, probably will not. But hopefully we don’t have many players like this. But overall, I think, the cost of this war to Ukraine is estimated at about 400bn or 500bn. So if we can use 300bn of Russian assets, that will pay for a substantial part of this damage already, and that will be a big gift to European and American taxpayers who would otherwise contribute a large part of this reconstruction effort.

Martin Sandbu
Now for the very big question mark, we are recording this on February 14th during the Munich Security Conference. There have been various statements out of both Washington, DC and American representatives in Munich, some of which look like pretty big giveaways to Vladimir Putin. On the strategic side, there hasn’t really been a mention of sanctions. But on the economics, what happens if the US agrees to lift or soften sanctions on Russia? And in particular, can Europe sustain the pressure on its own?

Sergei Guriev
So Europe has powerful sanctions instruments, but of course the US is a much bigger player in this area simply because dollar sanctions are so important. The threat of American secondary sanctions for third countries is much more important than European secondary sanctions. I would remind the audience that until this war, this ongoing war, Europe was actually against the idea of secondary sanctions in principle. And it’s only this war that helped Europe realise that it has a powerful instrument of secondary sanctions. And so Europe doesn’t really know how to enforce those. So it uses the secondary sanctions as a threat. But America has much more knowledge and credibility in using those secondary sanctions. And when American financial officials talk to third countries saying, look, we’ve done that in the past, we can do it easily at zero cost, we have weaponised dollar. We know that. And we are not ashamed of that. People listen and . . . 

Martin Sandbu
 . . . speak softly and carry a big stick . . . 

Sergei Guriev
Absolutely. Forcing the peace through strength. Right? This is so what President Trump usually talks about, right? So in that sense, America is a much bigger player. And so I would be worried if America uses this carrot of removing sanctions.

Martin Sandbu
If it comes to this horror scenario for European leaders that the US basically abandons Ukraine, including on sanctions, you are saying that Europe does have some strengths it’s not fully employing now, there are things Europe can do, even if the total effect maybe isn’t as strong as with the US on board. But there’s more they can do than they’re doing now.

Sergei Guriev
Absolutely. And this is especially true if EU is joined by the UK because the whole idea of oil price cap is the oil which goes through the Baltic Sea should have UK insurance. Most of this insurance business is actually in the UK. Yeah, in the city of London, in a couple of firms actually. So Europe can do quite a bit of that. But of course it can do much more, especially on enforcing sanctions with the US. And so I think this is important.

So the other issue that people talk about carrots to be given to Putin, I should say that the US has a lot of sticks. Strengthening sanctions that we talked about, but also providing more weapons to Ukraine. Now, in that sense, if US establishment wants to force this negotiation on Vladimir Putin from a position of strength, it has all the arguments and instruments.

Martin Sandbu
In the little time we have left, Sergei, I want to ask you about your last book, which I think you wrote before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. And it wasn’t specifically about Russia, but more generally about autocratic regimes. It was called Spin Dictators. And I think Putin at the time was an example of a spin dictator. So just tell us briefly what spin dictators are and why Putin was, but maybe isn’t any more, an example.

Sergei Guriev
That’s exactly right. And basically, the idea of this book is if you look around the world in the 21st century, most dictators are different from the classical model of the 20th century. The current dictators — for those who can see us — are dressed in grey suits like I’m wearing today, travel to Davos. They are not dressed in military or paramilitary uniforms, so they don’t project strength and fear. They pretend to be democrats. They use information manipulation. They subvert checks and balances rather than implement one-party system. They usually actually have elections, parliaments, opposition parties. They always win those elections. And in the book, we talk about instruments that help them to stay in power. And interestingly, in the recent decades, we have documented and we have a lot of data in the book, we’ve documented this qualitative shift from the old model based on open mass repression and fear to the new model, which is based on lies and manipulation of information and subversion of democratic institutions. And Vladimir Putin was a very sophisticated spin dictator but . . . 

Martin Sandbu
Does it work better than the old style?

Sergei Guriev
Yes, it does work better because you travel to western capitals, you import western technology, you get investors, which Putin doesn’t do any more. Right? And that’s a big difference. So your country develops. You still have old-style models, like North Korea, it’s still a typical 20th century dictatorship. But the newer model works better exactly because you get some economic development out of this. Actually, the first edition of the book, as you rightly said, we finished the draft in the spring of 2021. And already in that edition, we said, look, there are indications that Putin is moving towards the dictatorship of fear. And it’s not one example of that. We also talk in the book how Venezuela moved from spin dictatorship of Chavez to the fear dictatorship of Maduro. So things like this happen occasionally, go back in time, rebuild the old model, and then everybody knows that you are a real dictator. You cannot pretend to be a democrat any more.

Martin Sandbu
Does this interact with what we’ve talked about earlier in the podcast that partly because sanctions reduce the scope for manoeuvre for these dictators, that’s why they’re in part forced to return to a more brutal model?

Sergei Guriev
Absolutely. You run out of resources. It’s not just sanctions. You may just run out of economic growth because the corrupt system doesn’t allow you to produce real high-value industrial development or post-industrial development or develop knowledge-intensive industries. And when you run out of economic growth, sometimes you go back to the old model. In Venezuela, for example, the issue was oil prices collapsed in 2014. And also Chavez was more charismatic and Maduro less charismatic. So it was easier just to rely on brute force.

And then interestingly, in the spring of 2021, when you look at the polls, all started to show that majority of Russians are aware of potential return of repressions. That was the time when Alexei Navalny came back from Germany after being poisoned and his recovery in Germany. He came back and there was a number of mass demonstrations in his support when he was arrested. And those demonstrations were brutally repressed. And then unlike before, when Alexei Navalny was prosecuted for tax fraud, for all kinds of non-political stuff, in the spring of 2021, Putin announced that Navalny and his organisations are extremists and terrorists and started prosecuting them as political prisoners, basically. So even before the war, there was this transition and of course, the war completed this transition to fear dictatorship within a week when Putin closed down all independent media, when he actually blocked Facebook and Instagram in Russia and when they introduced open military censorship. So for a conversation we are having right now, both of us would go to jail in Russia for 10 years or more.

Martin Sandbu
This form is obviously more brutal. I suppose the hope is that it’s maybe also slightly more brittle than spin dictatorships.

Sergei Guriev
We’ve seen that in Syria, right? In the book, we give the example of Assad’s Syria as a brutal dictatorship. But as you rightly said, this is less a flexible model and maybe it is brittle.

Martin Sandbu
Last question, you’ve pointed out that some of the tools of spin dictators are obviously available and used in democracies as well, including by populists. We’ve now had a bit more than a month of the second Trump presidency. And we, of course, have a history of the first. Is Trump a spin dictator?

Sergei Guriev
I think the US is still a democracy and indeed in some cases in the west and I’m not talking about the US right now, I think it’s too early to talk about the US. And I would be really, really careful not to call the US anything but democracy. It’s still a democracy. There is not indication that democracy is falling apart. And Trump did say that he wants to be a dictator for one day to destroy all the democratic institutions. But maybe by the time our podcast is out, things will change. But by now, it’s still a democracy.

Martin Sandbu
There is still hope. I think that’s at least somewhat optimistic note on which we can finish. Sergei Guriev, thank you very much for coming on the show.

Sergei Guriev
Thank you very much, Martin, for inviting me.

With Sergei Guriev,"Martin Sandbu talks to Sergei Guriev, dean of London Business School ",Martin Sandbu,Print this page,(opens in new window),"Martin Sandbu One of the biggest geopolitical questions of the moment is the war in Ukraine and how to stop it. A big part of the answer to that is what economic pressure or what economic concessions could change Russia’s calculations. Vladimir Putin claims that his economy is strong and sanctions have failed. But what is propaganda and what is reality? Today on the show, we’re going to try to find out what is really going on in Russia’s economy.  [MUSIC PLAYING] This is The Economics Show. I’m Martin Sandbu, and joining me in the studio is Sergei Guriev, dean of London Business School and economic adviser to Russian opposition figures. Sergei, welcome to the show. Sergei Guriev
Thank you very much, Martin, for inviting me. Martin Sandbu
Sergei, you are a Russian native. You are also a French citizen now. It’s been a while since you’ve been able to go back to your native country, isn’t it? Sergei Guriev
That’s right. I had to leave Russia in 2013, where people close to Vladimir Putin suggested that I should buy a one-way ticket as soon as possible. That’s what I did. The next day I left Russia. Since then, I actually visited Russia three times. Each time it was a couple of days when I was a chief economist of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. I had some kind of diplomatic immunity, so I thought that it would be safe and it was actually safe. The last time I was in Russia physically was 2018. Martin Sandbu
And I should have mentioned that one of your credentials is that you were the chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development before your recent academic positions. Sergei, you are also a friend and you were an adviser to Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny, and you’re friends with his family. Could you tell us a bit about your relationship with them? Sergei Guriev
Yes, I know Alexei Navalny. I’ve known Alexei Navalny since 2008 when he was a corporate activist fighting corruption . . .  Martin Sandbu
Anti-corruption activist . . .  Sergei Guriev
. . . anti-corruption activist in state companies. I was a board member in Sberbank at that point and then together we tried to improve corporate governance in Sberbank. I should say the management was open to that. And since then we’ve been in touch. We talked a lot. I would indeed say that we were friends. I know his kids, Zakhar and Dasha. I know his wife, and we’ve been in touch and we continue to be in touch with the family. Alexei was a unique leader, somebody who worked really hard. He understood what he wants to achieve and he was very committed and fearless in this effort. And unfortunately, he paid for his idealism with his life. Martin Sandbu
And he died Friday exactly a year ago, as we are recording this. You advised him on economics. So let us talk about your insights into the Russian economy. As I mentioned in the introduction, Putin has trumpeted some good numbers to basically prove that the west is powerless to affect mighty Russia, the economy is resilient and to generally try to instil both at home, I think, and abroad this message of strength. You have obviously studied the economy for a long time. You will have insights from contacts back in the country. Tell us what is really going on. Sergei Guriev So Putin is not wrong if you look at official numbers. I think these numbers reflect the national accounts. It’s an economics show, so let me walk you through how we measure GDP in a country at war, which is very different from a country at peace. So GDP measures value added. So if you have government procurement, we usually measure those goods that the government buys and the cost that the government is charged. So when the government buys, say, a billion-dollars worth of tanks, that’s addition to GDP of a billion dollars. Now, these tanks are burnt in Ukrainian fields. It doesn’t seem like a good value added for the Russian economic performance. It’s actually equivalent to government just printing this billion dollars and handing over to those people who work in the tank factory or their shareholders without producing anything. So on paper, it looks like Russia is actually producing a lot of GDP, but a lot of those GDP are soldiers who are killed in Ukraine or wounded in Ukraine with their families getting cash or weapons producers, munitions producers who seem like contributing to GDP. But actually this contribution is not very important.  Now, a lot of economic growth is explained by this. So if you just look at one particular budget item, which is defence spending, it went up from about 3 per cent of GDP to almost 7 per cent of GDP. So that per se is a major increase in spending. But then of course, there are other industries like producing goods and services, transportation for the army. And a lot of that is outside of this narrowly defined defence spending. So if you identify industries related to the war, as some analysts are doing, eventually the story is all the growth is concentrated in the military sector. And now the question is who pays for that?  And of course, Russia still has sovereign wealth fund. The liquid part of this fund is smaller and smaller. It’s now standing at about 2 per cent of GDP. So it’s literally, you can say, one year of budget deficit away.  On the other hand, Russia is also using inflation. As I said, when you print money to give it to families of soldiers who were killed or to soldiers themselves, it’s equivalent to just what economists love to say, helicopter money, right, to just inject newly printed money into the economy that leads to inflation. Because when you hand this money to soldiers’ families, nothing is produced. And so there is more cash for the same output produced in the economy. So that raises inflation. And not surprisingly, interest rates are very high. Now, the Central Bank of Russia decided not to increase interest rates in February, but it still stands at 21 per cent. Right? This is a big, big number that shows that central bank is really worried about inflation. And when you actually talk to people on the ground, they don’t believe official inflation numbers. And again, I am not saying that Russian official statistics is lying, but a lot of things you can mismeasure in a country at war. The reason for that is what we call quality adjustment. So you come to the shop and you buy lower-quality goods that used to be cheaper. Martin Sandbu
For example? Sergei Guriev
Think about cars, right? Cars are probably the most visible example. Russia used to consume European cars or European cars or Japanese cars assembled in Russia. And Russia would also buy Chinese cars, but the price of Chinese cars would be 30 to 50 per cent lower. So now you buy Chinese cars and most of the cars are Chinese, right? You buy Chinese cars at the price of German cars. For Russian official statistics, there is no inflation. One car, same price. But actually there is a lot of inflation because if you look at models, makes, one for one, the prices have increased by tens of per cents and in some cases doubled. So a lot of inflation is actually not taken into account, not because the Russian official statistics are lying, but actually it’s very hard to track the price increase adjusted for quality when you have such a huge transformation because Russian consumption portfolio has changed dramatically in those three years. Martin Sandbu
Let’s go back to the numbers of the cost of the war, because I see a lot of people here focus on the budgetary numbers. And that’s where you started as well. But I always find it useful as an economist to kind of go back and think about the real resources that are being put in, whether those are raised through some sort of inflation tax, actual public spending, printing money or some off-balance sheet thing. In the end, there have to be real resources devoted to making tanks, making guns, feeding soldiers, transporting them and so on, and transporting their corpses back, all the things of war. Do we have a handle on how much of the Russian economy, in real terms, is now devoted to fighting and trying to oppress Ukraine? Sergei Guriev
So nobody knows. Sometimes you see estimates which just add up this line item, which I mentioned defence spending, but also law enforcement spending. Once you add up those two things, you end up in the range of 10 per cent of GDP. But the number may actually be higher. Nobody’s saying that Russia is as militarised as Soviet Union. This debate is very important, by the way. Why? Because when cold war ended and Soviet Union drastically demilitarised, that hit the aggregate economy a lot because the defence sector was such a big part of the Soviet economy. Some estimates would say that it was up to 20 per cent of GDP. And so early 1990s, recession was a big shock for the whole economy and . . .  Martin Sandbu
Because nothing replaced that spending. Sergei Guriev Exactly, exactly. You have to go through very painful restructuring, reskilling the defence workers to do something else, services. It takes time and effort. And now there are worries that Putin doesn’t want to negotiate because he’s worried about postwar recession. But again, as I would say is first and foremost, Russians know how to live in the economy in peace. So this is recent memory and also this size of the military economy is probably half of what it used to be in Soviet times. And it’s also a market economy. So adjustment will be easier. But this is a very important conversation.  Now, one thing which people sometimes say is the whole Russia is working for this war, Russians like this war because they benefit from the war. This is, I think, an exaggeration. If you look at how many families have been involved in the war, we are still talking about single-digit millions of people in the country, which is 140mn. Martin Sandbu But Sergei, there must be a lot of redistribution going on here because we have heard about very high wage increases for people in weapons-related manufacturing. We know, of course, there are big wage premia for recruitment when they’re trying to mobilise or avoid compulsory mobilisation. But of course, if real resources are limited and we’ll talk a bit more about those limits in a second, that means other people are getting less either because they are not getting the wage increases and inflation is driving prices up or because they are outright losing somehow. What picture do you have of that?  Sergei Guriev Right. Martin I really like your focus on the real cost and not monetary cost and not nominal variables. Indeed, if you think about this, we move resources to the military economy, which produces something which brings zero value to the Russian population. These tanks are being burnt in Ukraine. They don’t create value within Russia. And so basically the cost comes through different channels. First, indeed, you need to run your military factories 24/7, which means you need to pay a lot of wages there, which means civilian companies have to pay higher wages. They are actually short of labour. We are not even talking about people who have left, which is probably another 1 or 2 per cent of labour force. Right? But again, probably 1 per cent of labour force, maybe 2 per cent of labour force, are directly involved in the hostilities in Ukraine. Right? So these are big numbers. So not surprisingly, unemployment is at 2 per cent. Very low unemployment. Sometimes Mr Putin is proud of that. You were talking about propaganda. Putin sometimes says we are very happy that unemployment is low, but it’s actually a signal that civilian sector is very short on labour. This is one channel.  The other channel is cost of capital. So central bank is increasing interest rate to fight inflation. Who is suffering from that? Military sector doesn’t suffer because military production is actually prepaid in the beginning of the year, they don’t need to borrow. Sometimes you hear that even military producers complain about high interest rates. But this is the export-import of Russian military complex. The Ukraine war-related part of military economy gets prepaid in January. Martin Sandbu
Can I just ask you about that? Because this, I think, refers to something quite a lot of people were picking up on, which was that the boss of Rostec, the weapons manufacturer — Chemezov, I think, is his name — was complaining that this was making weapons manufacturing unprofitable. And you are saying he was referring to the export business. But that means, doesn’t it, that somehow the war is cannibalising what used to be a profitable export business. And if you go as far as having to reduce your profitable exports, it must be that you are coming up against constraints. Is that the right way to think about? Sergei Guriev Absolutely. And the whole civilian economy has to pay higher interest rates. And they are screaming. They’re saying that those interest rates are killing us. But they forget that the whole idea of higher interest rates is to cool down the economy. Which part of the economy has to be cooled down? The civilian one, because Putin wants to run the military economy at 24/7. So this is the redistribution from civilian normal economy towards military economy.  There is another redistribution that you referred to in passing, which is redistribution towards poorer part of the Russian population. So the way Putin recruits soldiers, he pays higher salaries and he targets poorer regions where those salaries are multiples of average salary in the region, in some case 10 times the average salary in the region. And so in a sense, his cynical idea is Russians were very poor and these are the families I’m going to target, because for those families, these are the amounts they’ve never seen before, it will never see in the future. And this is so painful for me as somebody who was born in Russia, because if you think about this, this redistribution is actually progressive redistribution. Could Putin have done that without the war? And the answer is yes. You just give this cash to poor parts of Russia without sending these individuals to be killed in Ukraine and kill Ukrainians. This whole redistribution project would have proceeded without the war. Putin did have the money. And so this is an extremely painful thought. Martin Sandbu
It’s a very morbid kind of levelling up, to be a little too glib about it. And it strikes me from what you were saying that the other thing Putin or his economic managers are doing is to show that crude war Keynesianism works. You can actually mobilise all the resources inside your country if you are determined as a state to do it. But at some point you come up at limits in terms of your domestic resources. And I suppose that’s where we are, right? That’s why you see these inflationary pressures and the need to increase interest rates. Sergei Guriev
Let me just say one thing about Keynes, right? Your co-host on this show is Soumaya Keynes, who I think is a relative of John Maynard Keynes. So Keynesianism is about an economy which has slack. So indeed, the whole idea is to spend a lot to eliminate unemployment, bring the economy closer to full employment, but then stop. Otherwise you do have inflation. You do have labour shortages. And in this case, military Keynesianism is a misnomer in the sense that Keynes is insulted. His idea was to restore full employment and not to create inflation. And here we have in Russia, we have the opposite phenomenon where you push it too far, exactly because you want to have full employment in the military sector. But that also creates this (inaudible) constraints and inflation and very, very low unemployment. Martin Sandbu
There have been some reports out there suggesting that quite a bit of the war is also financed in sort of off-balance sheet credit. I wrote my last column about Russia on this. And you know, with the irresponsible license of a columnist, I said it shows that Russia’s economy is a house of cards, which you should be very free to disagree with. But on the substance, is there a lot of financing going on through the sort of private banking system? How significant is that and what are the vulnerabilities that that may create? Sergei Guriev I think this debate still continues, and I think you’re referring to Craig Kennedy who is a great and thoughtful analyst of Russian economy, especially of sanctions and energy sanctions in particular. I’m very proud to have worked with Craig on the design of Russian oil sanctions. But this debate on off-balance sheet financing is actually continuing because some numbers he’s given are very hard to verify. And the most important part of his argument is that the government will at some point, will bail out those loans, which is hard to predict whether government will or will not do that.  So as I said and you said that in real terms, what matters is the aggregate real cost of the war, which is very significant. And this inflation is already bringing in, of those costs. So, yes, Putin is very innovative and sophisticated in financing this war. And I would like to disagree with your statement that this is a house of cards in the following way.  So if you are in a democratic country and you have economic pressures like this, people will take to the street. In Russia, they would not. Russia was not a paragon of democracy before 2022 and even before 2014. In the end of the day, as I mentioned, I had to leave in 2013 not because I wanted to. But today it’s a qualitatively different level of repression. And even though Russians are suffering from high inflation, from a decline in purchasing power of their salaries, these are real effects, but Russians don’t take to the street because they’re afraid. And in that sense, Putin’s financing model is not about saying, OK, I run out of cash, I stop the war. His idea is, OK, I run out of cash, so I will raise taxes. I will reduce pensions in real terms. I will reduce salaries of doctors and teachers in real terms. And I hope that they will not overthrow me. And I will, of course, never reduce salaries of my right police. And so when this thing breaks, we don’t know.  The economy is facing constraints. So one important indication is that this year he raised taxes by about one percentage point of GDP, which is not a trivial amount. He has never done that before. Sometimes he would raise taxes in 25 years in power, but by very small amounts. This time he had to raise taxes significantly because he is facing budget constraints. And the west, of course, has a lot of instruments to increase this pain. And of course, when you raise taxes, it slows down economic growth. It also makes a lot of people unhappy. But as long as you can rely on your right police and KGB, you can afford that. Martin Sandbu
And I suppose inside of that, there are economic policy choices to make about how you balance the various ways of extracting resources where you don’t need to have them that causes the least political risk. But I want to add one question to this, because we’ve talked about the domestic constraints. Of course, Russia is a surplus economy still, and it’s traditionally very much financed by natural resource exports. Those export earnings have gone down because of sanctions. Imports have been limited or become more costly also because of sanctions. It’s still a surplus economy. So I would like you to explain to me how if you’re in a . . . you’re trying to run a war, you are running up against domestic constraints, you shouldn’t really be running a surplus, right? You would want to spend all your earnings to import whatever it is you need, either directly for the war or to substitute for domestic resources. How should we understand the fact that Russia still has a smaller but still an external surplus? Sergei Guriev I love this question because right now there is a lot of debate about trade surpluses. In the biggest economy in the world, the United States, there is a debate to what extent we should fight trade surpluses with trade instruments. And the consensus on macroeconomics is trade deficit is a capital account surplus. And this is what we teach. If you have a flexible exchange rate, if everybody wants to send their capital to you, your currency appreciates to the extent that you run a trade deficit. And this is exactly what’s happening in the US, which is importing capital and running trade deficit because it is actually a wonderful destination for investment, in relative terms at least.  And this is the opposite of what we see in Russia. The fact that Russia is running a current account surplus is a reflection of the fact that Russia is exporting capital. This is as simple as that. So if Russia improves its investment climate, the rouble will strengthen and Russia will run a smaller surplus. However, we are where we are, and Russia is exporting almost 200bn worth of oil every year. And this is a lot of money. And of course, Putin wants to import technology and this is where our sanctions limit his capacity to do that. First and foremost, as you rightly said, sanctions do reduce inflow of petrodollars. In some years, the impact would be in the range of $50bn per year, which is 3 per cent of GDP. Now it’s probably closer to 20, as Putin has learned how to circumvent sanctions and 20 is like 1 per cent of GDP. So it’s not that big, unfortunately. Now, new sanctions which were introduced in the end of the Biden administration, supported by sanctions from the UK side and European side, create additional tension. So hopefully Putin will get even less of influx of petrodollars, but it is what it is.  Now the other question is can Putin use those to buy? And this is where sanctions, technological sanctions introduced in the very first months of the war and then tightened and strengthened later and later on, limit his capacity to buy advanced technology in the west. China also is told by western allies it should not supply military technology to Russia. And my understanding is that indeed Putin cannot get everything he wants from China because of the threat of secondary sanctions. Now, Putin circumvents those sanctions. He finds loopholes. And this is where a lot of sanctions enforcement matters. Where those loopholes are identified, often they’re identified thanks to wonderful investigative journalists, including Financial Times, which writes about stories how Russian intermediaries buy through third countries, fourth countries, fifth countries, buy military technology in the west. These individuals then are sanctioned themselves. And this is a cat-and-mouse game where each new loophole being closed results in another loophole which is more and more expensive. So Putin tries to import stuff, but there are huge transactional costs being created by sanctions. Martin Sandbu We’re going to have a very quick break. But when we return, I will ask Sergei what options western countries have to increase this economic pressure on Russia that we’ve just talked about. What may happen if they don’t or reduce it. And also, what his work on autocratic political systems teach us about what might happen next in both Moscow and Washington DC.  [MUSIC PLAYING] And we’re back with Sergei Guriev to talk about the Russian economy. Before the break, Sergei, we talked about how sanctions seem to be having an effect on limiting the options that Putin have that’s sometimes not fully appreciated in the west. If we look forward now, what are the sort of policy decisions that could be taken by the coalition, the sanctioning coalition, if we wanted to increase the pressure on Putin? Sergei Guriev I think the way you formulate the question is exactly right, because sometimes people are saying sanctions are not working, sanctions are not important because the war is continuing. But we should not compare the impact of sanctions on Putin’s economy with what we would like to see but with the real counterfactual, what would have happened without sanctions? And I would remind the listeners that, well, Russia lost access to $300bn of sovereign reserves. With a $300bn in his pockets, Putin would have hired a lot more soldiers and bought a lot more North Korean munitions. Putin also is facing difficulties, as I mentioned before, in accessing western advanced technology. With unrestricted access to global markets, Putin would have bought a lot more military stuff. So I think by now the outcome of the war would be very different if not for the sanctions.  And finally, as I said, and you mentioned that in your question, Putin is getting a lot of petrodollars. This is what brings him foreign currency and this is what brings him cash in real terms as well. You quite rightly said we need to focus on the real variables. And so this is the main battleground right now. So the oil sanctions were only introduced in December 2022, February 2023 in Europe. US and UK embargoed Russian oil right away in the spring 2022. Martin Sandbu
But they were not big importers. Sergei Guriev Exactly. They were not big importers. These were the European sanctions that mattered. And initially, the sanctions had a big effect. As I said, we were talking, in 2023, we were talking about 3 per cent of GDP that Putin lost. But then Putin built this shadow tanker fleet, and it’s only in 2024 the west started to work on that. Hundreds of ships were actually sanctioned. And this is a very innovative tool. I should say I’m really impressed by the sanctioning coalition, how many sanctions, but also how innovative solutions, how innovative the solutions were designed and introduced. And during the last couple of years, one of those were actually sanctioning individual vessels. By now, I think about 300 vessels are sanctioned by Europe, US, UK or both, or the whole three, and that limits Putin’s capacity to export oil. Of course, he buys new shadow fleet tankers. And the battleground here is exactly to track down those tankers, sanction the tankers, also check if the tankers are complying with the oil price cap, which is $60 per barrel.  Now, the debate is whether Europe can check the vessels in the Danish straits. In theory, Europe cannot because these are international waters and everybody has a right of passage. But apparently the idea is to offer conducting a check. And if the vessel declines this offer, then the vessel will be just sanctioned. So you cannot force the inspection, but you can propose an inspection on a voluntary basis. So these are the debates which are taking place right now. The most important debate is actual enforcement of sanctions and tracking down sanctions evasion that I mentioned. Martin Sandbu
So this is about stopping or blocking, plugging loopholes. It’s about enforcing better. It’s basically about putting more resources into implementation. Are there also further steps, new sanctions or tightening of existing sanctions that we should be considering, or which are the most promising places to look at? Sergei Guriev
So pretty much everything is already on the table. And indeed, the question is about enforcement. So from the very beginning of oil price cap, I insisted that we should reduce the oil price cap from 60 to 55 to 50. You know, the whole idea of oil price cap is we want Russian oil to be present on the market. So there is no global energy crisis. But we want Russia to be deprived of oil revenues. So Russia can still export at 60, its above marginal cost. Russia can still export at the price of 55 or 50. Maybe at 40, Russia will start closing down oilfields. But in order to move from 60 to 55, we need to first enforce 60. And this is not done yet. I think this is very (inaudible). And if you do that slowly and steadily, first you don’t create a crisis. If you move from 60 to 55, it’s unlikely that Russia stops exporting everything it does. And second, if you do implement this policy slowly and steadily, you also send a signal that if your economy’s struggling now, wait for half a year when we move $5 lower. Martin Sandbu
What about gas? Europe is still buying liquefied natural gas from Russia. Sergei Guriev
These are small fish. Right? So gas is much less important to Russia than oil. And LNG, liquefied natural gas, is much less important to Russia than pipeline. And Europe’s imports of Russian gas have come down by a factor of four or five. So it’s really not a very important source of revenue. The main battleground is oil. Martin Sandbu
And what about financial sanctions, Sergei? There are at least two questions here. One is that there are still banking channels that are on sanctions. Some of those have to do with facilitating the energy trade. And then, of course, there’s the big outstanding questions of the immobilised state reserves, the foreign exchange reserves, perhaps 300bn or thereabouts, mostly in Europe. What is your view on the debate about whether those should be transferred outright as a downpayment on compensation to Ukraine? Sergei Guriev
I think on the last question I’m in favour and I was in favour of using those resources for compensating Ukraine. We wrote a report on the reconstruction of Ukraine already in March-April 2022, with a group of CEPR economists, including Yuriy Gorodnichenko and several former IMF chief economists. So we are in favour. I’m in favour of transferring those resources, but it’s not clear whether you can legally do it right away. Martin Sandbu
This is an economics podcast, so I’ll leave the legal issues to one side. But there’s an economic argument or financial argument that’s often made against, which is that this would lead to financial instability and in particular for euro instruments. The European Central Bank has been quite vocal in its opposition on the basis of that argument. What do you think? Sergei Guriev
The European Central Bank’s job is to protect the stability of euro, minimise every possible risk. And indeed, if you weaponise euro like the US has weaponised dollar in the last decades, that of course creates an additional risk. But currently I don’t think we have credible competitors to dollar and euro as international reserve currency. And also not every country in the world wants to start such a big bloody war. So when we say, well, if you confiscate Russian assets, somebody else in this world will say, we’ll never store anything in Europe any more, well, people who are going to start a big bloody war, like the war in Ukraine, probably will not. But hopefully we don’t have many players like this. But overall, I think, the cost of this war to Ukraine is estimated at about 400bn or 500bn. So if we can use 300bn of Russian assets, that will pay for a substantial part of this damage already, and that will be a big gift to European and American taxpayers who would otherwise contribute a large part of this reconstruction effort. Martin Sandbu
Now for the very big question mark, we are recording this on February 14th during the Munich Security Conference. There have been various statements out of both Washington, DC and American representatives in Munich, some of which look like pretty big giveaways to Vladimir Putin. On the strategic side, there hasn’t really been a mention of sanctions. But on the economics, what happens if the US agrees to lift or soften sanctions on Russia? And in particular, can Europe sustain the pressure on its own? Sergei Guriev
So Europe has powerful sanctions instruments, but of course the US is a much bigger player in this area simply because dollar sanctions are so important. The threat of American secondary sanctions for third countries is much more important than European secondary sanctions. I would remind the audience that until this war, this ongoing war, Europe was actually against the idea of secondary sanctions in principle. And it’s only this war that helped Europe realise that it has a powerful instrument of secondary sanctions. And so Europe doesn’t really know how to enforce those. So it uses the secondary sanctions as a threat. But America has much more knowledge and credibility in using those secondary sanctions. And when American financial officials talk to third countries saying, look, we’ve done that in the past, we can do it easily at zero cost, we have weaponised dollar. We know that. And we are not ashamed of that. People listen and . . .  Martin Sandbu
 . . . speak softly and carry a big stick . . .  Sergei Guriev
Absolutely. Forcing the peace through strength. Right? This is so what President Trump usually talks about, right? So in that sense, America is a much bigger player. And so I would be worried if America uses this carrot of removing sanctions. Martin Sandbu
If it comes to this horror scenario for European leaders that the US basically abandons Ukraine, including on sanctions, you are saying that Europe does have some strengths it’s not fully employing now, there are things Europe can do, even if the total effect maybe isn’t as strong as with the US on board. But there’s more they can do than they’re doing now. Sergei Guriev Absolutely. And this is especially true if EU is joined by the UK because the whole idea of oil price cap is the oil which goes through the Baltic Sea should have UK insurance. Most of this insurance business is actually in the UK. Yeah, in the city of London, in a couple of firms actually. So Europe can do quite a bit of that. But of course it can do much more, especially on enforcing sanctions with the US. And so I think this is important.  So the other issue that people talk about carrots to be given to Putin, I should say that the US has a lot of sticks. Strengthening sanctions that we talked about, but also providing more weapons to Ukraine. Now, in that sense, if US establishment wants to force this negotiation on Vladimir Putin from a position of strength, it has all the arguments and instruments. Martin Sandbu
In the little time we have left, Sergei, I want to ask you about your last book, which I think you wrote before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. And it wasn’t specifically about Russia, but more generally about autocratic regimes. It was called Spin Dictators. And I think Putin at the time was an example of a spin dictator. So just tell us briefly what spin dictators are and why Putin was, but maybe isn’t any more, an example. Sergei Guriev
That’s exactly right. And basically, the idea of this book is if you look around the world in the 21st century, most dictators are different from the classical model of the 20th century. The current dictators — for those who can see us — are dressed in grey suits like I’m wearing today, travel to Davos. They are not dressed in military or paramilitary uniforms, so they don’t project strength and fear. They pretend to be democrats. They use information manipulation. They subvert checks and balances rather than implement one-party system. They usually actually have elections, parliaments, opposition parties. They always win those elections. And in the book, we talk about instruments that help them to stay in power. And interestingly, in the recent decades, we have documented and we have a lot of data in the book, we’ve documented this qualitative shift from the old model based on open mass repression and fear to the new model, which is based on lies and manipulation of information and subversion of democratic institutions. And Vladimir Putin was a very sophisticated spin dictator but . . .  Martin Sandbu
Does it work better than the old style? Sergei Guriev
Yes, it does work better because you travel to western capitals, you import western technology, you get investors, which Putin doesn’t do any more. Right? And that’s a big difference. So your country develops. You still have old-style models, like North Korea, it’s still a typical 20th century dictatorship. But the newer model works better exactly because you get some economic development out of this. Actually, the first edition of the book, as you rightly said, we finished the draft in the spring of 2021. And already in that edition, we said, look, there are indications that Putin is moving towards the dictatorship of fear. And it’s not one example of that. We also talk in the book how Venezuela moved from spin dictatorship of Chavez to the fear dictatorship of Maduro. So things like this happen occasionally, go back in time, rebuild the old model, and then everybody knows that you are a real dictator. You cannot pretend to be a democrat any more. Martin Sandbu
Does this interact with what we’ve talked about earlier in the podcast that partly because sanctions reduce the scope for manoeuvre for these dictators, that’s why they’re in part forced to return to a more brutal model? Sergei Guriev Absolutely. You run out of resources. It’s not just sanctions. You may just run out of economic growth because the corrupt system doesn’t allow you to produce real high-value industrial development or post-industrial development or develop knowledge-intensive industries. And when you run out of economic growth, sometimes you go back to the old model. In Venezuela, for example, the issue was oil prices collapsed in 2014. And also Chavez was more charismatic and Maduro less charismatic. So it was easier just to rely on brute force.  And then interestingly, in the spring of 2021, when you look at the polls, all started to show that majority of Russians are aware of potential return of repressions. That was the time when Alexei Navalny came back from Germany after being poisoned and his recovery in Germany. He came back and there was a number of mass demonstrations in his support when he was arrested. And those demonstrations were brutally repressed. And then unlike before, when Alexei Navalny was prosecuted for tax fraud, for all kinds of non-political stuff, in the spring of 2021, Putin announced that Navalny and his organisations are extremists and terrorists and started prosecuting them as political prisoners, basically. So even before the war, there was this transition and of course, the war completed this transition to fear dictatorship within a week when Putin closed down all independent media, when he actually blocked Facebook and Instagram in Russia and when they introduced open military censorship. So for a conversation we are having right now, both of us would go to jail in Russia for 10 years or more. Martin Sandbu
This form is obviously more brutal. I suppose the hope is that it’s maybe also slightly more brittle than spin dictatorships. Sergei Guriev
We’ve seen that in Syria, right? In the book, we give the example of Assad’s Syria as a brutal dictatorship. But as you rightly said, this is less a flexible model and maybe it is brittle. Martin Sandbu
Last question, you’ve pointed out that some of the tools of spin dictators are obviously available and used in democracies as well, including by populists. We’ve now had a bit more than a month of the second Trump presidency. And we, of course, have a history of the first. Is Trump a spin dictator? Sergei Guriev
I think the US is still a democracy and indeed in some cases in the west and I’m not talking about the US right now, I think it’s too early to talk about the US. And I would be really, really careful not to call the US anything but democracy. It’s still a democracy. There is not indication that democracy is falling apart. And Trump did say that he wants to be a dictator for one day to destroy all the democratic institutions. But maybe by the time our podcast is out, things will change. But by now, it’s still a democracy. Martin Sandbu
There is still hope. I think that’s at least somewhat optimistic note on which we can finish. Sergei Guriev, thank you very much for coming on the show. Sergei Guriev Thank you very much, Martin, for inviting me.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Martin Sandbu
That is all for this week. You have been listening to The Economics Show from the FT. This episode was produced by Edith Rousselot, with original music from Breen Turner. It is edited by Bryant Urstadt. Our executive producer is Manuela Saragosa. Cheryl Brumley is the FT’s global head of audio. I’m Martin Sandbu. Thanks for listening.",2025-02-17,This is an audio transcript of The Economics Show podcast episode,"In this episode of The Economics Show, host Martin Sandbu discusses the state of the Russian economy with Sergei Guriev, an economist and adviser to the Russian opposition. They explore the impact of the Ukraine war on Russia's economy, questioning the resilience claimed by President Vladimir Putin amid sanctions.

1. **Economic Performance**: Guriev points out that while Russian GDP figures seem strong, much of this growth comes from military spending, which does not translate into real value for citizens. The military economy is now consuming a significant portion of resources, with defense spending increasing from 3% to nearly 7% of GDP.

2. **Inflation and Interest Rates**: Russia is facing high inflation due to increased government spending related to the war. The Central Bank's high-interest rates (21%) indicate concern over inflation, but official statistics may underreport actual inflation due to changes in consumption patterns.

3. **Labor Redistribution**: The focus on the military has led to labor shortages in the civilian sector and increased wages in defense industries, highlighting a shift in resource allocation. Many families are affected, especially in poorer regions, where they are targeted for recruitment with significant financial incentives.

4. **Economic Constraints**: Despite its current account surplus, Russia's economic model is under pressure from sanctions limiting access to technology and international markets. Guriev forecasts potential difficulties ahead as the government raises taxes to fund military efforts, which could slow economic growth.

5. **Strategies for Western Sanctions**: Guriev emphasizes the need for effective enforcement of sanctions, particularly on oil and gas exports, which are crucial revenue sources for Putin. He suggests lowering the oil price cap as a potential strategy to limit revenues while avoiding global energy crises.

6. **Impact on Governance**: The conversation shifts to the nature of Putin’s regime, which Guriev categorizes as moving from a ""spin dictatorship,"" focused on manipulation and controlled democratic processes, to a more brutal regime characterized by repression and fear following the invasion.

In summary, the podcast paints a complex picture of the Russian economy under wartime pressures, showing signs of strain while acknowledging the government's ability to sustain operations through fiscal manipulation and labor redistribution. The effectiveness of Western sanctions remains pivotal to future developments."

John Burn-Murdoch
Hello, I am John Burn-Murdoch, sitting in for Soumaya Keynes on the FT’s Economics Show. In my day job, I crunch data and make charts for the FT in my weekly column, Data Points. And a few months back, I wrote a column arguing that the west was shifting away from a culture of progressive, of moving fast, breaking things and towards one more concerned with caution and perhaps risk or inequality.

And the theory I was setting out was that a lot of what determines how economies function, what they do and how they grow is how we think about or talk about innovation and progress on a societal level. Shortly afterwards, someone wrote a very interesting response, pushing back, I think, on some of the things I was saying, but bringing a lot more material to the discussion. And that was my guest today, Matt Clancy.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

So, Matt, hello. Thanks for being here. Now, by way of introduction, can you tell us a little bit about who you are, what you do and why the debate about what produces progress is a matter close to your heart?

Matt Clancy
Yeah. So by training, I’m an academic economist and I specialised in the economics of science and innovation and used to teach at university, worked for government. But now I am at Open Philanthropy. We’re a grantmaker, and I run the innovation policy programme there, which makes grants to try to accelerate scientific and technological progress. And so as part of that, you know, we’re trying to understand how do you make science and innovation go better. And I think one avenue that you explore is, has it gotten worse? And if so, why?

John Burn-Murdoch
Can you elaborate for a second on Open Philanthropy?

Matt Clancy
Yeah. So it’s an organisation that was founded, I think, originally to disperse and give away one wealthy person’s money, but we’ve since sort of expanded and now recommend grants to multiple organisations and people and so forth. And they’re based in Silicon Valley, although I work remotely from Iowa.

John Burn-Murdoch
Maybe to set the scene, there are various people who’ve had theories on what caused the Industrial Revolution to take place — when and where it did. Now, I think for listeners of a show produced by the FT, they’re probably more familiar with the view of someone like Robert Allen, who argues that this was fundamentally all about economics. You had a situation where the UK at the time had particularly expensive wage costs, expensive labour and cheap and abundant energy. And with those ingredients there, it was almost inevitable that it would pursue industry before the people. So if we say that’s the sort of classical view, maybe you’re playing devil’s advocate here and this isn’t what you believe yourself, but could you tell us what the sort of culture-driving progress theory looks like?

Matt Clancy
Sure. I think the alternative theory is best explained by this economist Joel Mokyr, who’s an economic historian. And he kind of saw the industrial revolution as stemming from a confluence of several factors. There was a growing base of what he calls “useful knowledge”. So that’s broader than just science. There was a skilled artisanal network of people who could make use of that knowledge. But kind of a key interesting idea he has, especially for, I guess, an economist, is that he thinks the belief in the possibility of progress and the perfectibility of human institutions and sort of an interest in worldly things was this key idea and something that was perhaps not new. Maybe things like that had sometimes bubbled up in culture, but the conditions were right in Britain at that time and in Scotland and so forth, for an interest in progress and to try to figure out how to do things better could actually work and prove itself. And that became self-sustaining.

John Burn-Murdoch
Got it. Thank you. And I guess it’s worth emphasising here as well that this sounds kind of obvious today, right? The idea that we, as both individuals and societies might take it upon ourselves to improve our lot, to make our lives better or at least different. Whereas if you go back to, say, the 1500s, 1600s, there hadn’t been much change on the sort of grand historical scale in living standards in the way things worked for a very, very long time, right? And these were very religious societies. There was a sense that you get what you’re given and maybe you look to the heavens if you want to have a better year next year than you had before. And so this idea of just thinking the world we live in today and the way we interact with it and the way things look doesn’t necessarily need to be the world tomorrow. We can actually take an active part in changing that. This was very novel, right?

Matt Clancy
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, as you say, if you think back to how your life differs from your grandparents today, it’s quite a lot. You know, we hear the stories of how hard things were, but it wouldn’t have been that way back then. Just as long as you wanted to look back, things were the same, or in some cases, you might have believed they were better.

John Burn-Murdoch
Absolutely. And so I guess that was part of what prompted this super interesting paper that came out in 2023. Title: Enlightenment Ideals and Belief in Progress in the Run-up to the Industrial Revolution: A Textual Analysis. So this was by Ali Almelhem and co-authors, including Jared Rubin — who some listeners might be familiar with. And I guess the novel approach and insight that they took here was to say, OK, like the Mokyr theory, there is very well put together, it makes a lot of sense. How can we quantify the extent to which this was a thing that happened?

So they did textual analysis on hundreds of thousands of books that had been published in the period of interest. So we’re talking 15, 16, 1700s and beyond. And they looked at how the language of these books, first of all, could be split down into different categories. So books about religion, books more about science, books more about the political economy and how the structure of that writing changed over time. And also just how the frequency or type of different language used in these books evolved.

And they found something which I guess, we could at least say is consistent with Mokyr’s theory, which is that in the English language bibliography, as it were, of the time, you saw, first of all, this growth in books that were written in that political economy space and in the science space as well. And that there was a sense that the language used in these books was also perhaps evolving to talk more about these concepts of empiricism, experimentation, scientific method. I guess my reading of this paper as I expanded on in my piece was that it’s at least consistent with that theory that to the extent that language is a proxy for culture. There were changes going on here which would fit the idea that Britain and the English language was undergoing an evolution here, which teed it up for a more sort of hands-on approach to the betterment of individuals in society. Tell me where you disagree with that or does that sound about that?

Matt Clancy
I think that sounds like a pretty good summary. I mean, I think that maybe the slight tweaks is that they really look for what they call sort of progress-oriented language — you know, improvement, advance, rise. And I think they draw an interesting contrast to what they just called optimism. So there’s a distinction between making things better and just thinking things are good. And they show that language related to optimism had been there for a while, and it was in some of these religious texts. But language related to progress was centred on this political economy and to some degree, some of the scientific text which had grown in the run-up to the Industrial Revolution.

John Burn-Murdoch
Yeah, exactly. It’s that practical taking a greater agency in the future, I guess you could talk about. And so I guess, first of all, the high-level question here: to what extent do you think that analysing large corpuses of text is a useful way of tracking what the culture of the day in a given place was?

Matt Clancy
It’s like looking under the lamppost problem, right? Where like, it’s there, we can do something with it. I think it’s interesting and worth doing. I think the issue is that with these corpuses, the frequency of words like progress can change for various reasons. It can change just because there’s an explosion of writing, say, about science and there’s a bunch of new scientific articles being written and maybe they don’t talk about progress because they’re being, you know, neutral language and so forth. But maybe that doesn’t reflect the actual progress attitudes.

I guess another critique you sometimes hear is that one or two books that are super influential that everybody reads can be really representative of a group’s view. And the overall use of the word across every book is less represented. I mean, if you look at the Google data, I think the frequency of words like teeth or nose, bounce around in strange ways that don’t seem to reflect our interest in those topics.

John Burn-Murdoch
Right. Exactly. A great example. And I guess there’s also issues with, for example, one thing I looked at in my piece was using risk as another keyword to monitor perhaps the emergence of a more cautious culture. But of course, the emergence of financial markets leads to a lot of discussion about risk in a way that isn’t really to do with that at all. So there are definitely pitfalls here. And I guess that brings me onto the next question, which is I think perhaps where there was some of the most creative tension, as it were, between your response in my original piece was I was trying to throw this forward and say, OK, well, to the limited extent that we think word count, well, term frequency — to give it a more respectable name — can be a proxy for the culture of the day. Looking at some of that data in Google Ngram — where they’ve digitised all these millions of books — suggested that while there was this big increase in terms to do with progress in the pursuit of betterment over, say, the 1500s through to around the 1960s, which is an inflection point we might come on to, my contention was that it looks as though that evolution of language may have started going in the opposite direction over the 60 or so years since. So discussion about betterment, about hands-on attempts to improve our lot may have started declining. Now, I think this is perhaps a particular space where you would maybe come to a different opinion or argue at least that the evidence we have is maybe not strong enough to say that.

Matt Clancy
I think that the timing of when there was this decline, I’m more uncertain about it than maybe the chart that you put up in the original piece indicates. And I have just more uncertainty about whether the use of language is reflecting technological progress. Maybe people write more about progress when they see it happening, but it’s actually being driven by some third other thing that we don’t observe. But I think it’s quite plausible that attitudes towards progress affect people’s . . . what the careers they choose, how a society supports innovation to regulation — things like that.

John Burn-Murdoch
Totally take that on board. So I guess maybe the problem here is that progress is such a fuzzy concept that we better to focus on something a bit more concrete, a bit more tangible, like the pace of innovation out of scientific research. And so this is where obviously you’ve done an enormous amount of work. So if I said to you that it feels like innovation and research and these more tangible measures of progress, I guess we could say, if I said to you it feels like that itself is slowing down, would you say that’s fair or would you take a more nuanced take on that?

Matt Clancy
I think slowing down is hard to know and hard to justify. The kind of two big things that economists might look at is health and income, and particularly like productivity growth. Productivity growth has declined since the ‘60s, which is kind of interesting given that that’s when you found this progress language decline. And also, if you look at health gains, life expectancy, for example, in the United States increases linearly over a very long period of time. But what’s interesting is, you know, these changes are not enormous and, you know, maybe slowing down a little bit on the productivity side. But the amount of effort that we have put into research has grown enormously over that same time period. And I think that’s something that’s pretty hard to deny is that average research productivity or the average discovery per scientist or per worker that impacts health and income and lots of other things. That has to have gone down a lot simply because we’re pouring a lot more energy into that than we were years ago.

John Burn-Murdoch
Got it. So I guess the sort of argument here is not that the pace at which the world moves forward itself is slowing down, but given the vast amounts, more human power and money and time being put into this, the sort of hit rate is coming down.

Matt Clancy
Yeah. I mean, we’re running faster to stay in the same place. For the last, I don’t know, 50, 60 years, the US, for example, has poured about 3 per cent of GDP into R&D pretty consistently. But over that time period, the size of our GDP has grown substantially. And we’re investing a constant share of that growing pie into R&D without seeing faster rates of productivity growth, faster rates of life expectancy gains. People debate whether we should expect to see that or not, but it seems to me pretty undeniable that on a per scientist, per researcher level, what we’re getting from them is declining.

John Burn-Murdoch
Totally. And so picking up when you mention things like life expectancy now, I can obviously imagine an argument that says, look, there are fundamental biological constraints. That means that we shouldn’t expect that to increase at a constant rate over time. But would it be something like GDP or productivity if we were looking for an indicator that you think we really should expect to continue increasing a given rate relative to its inputs and therefore something where the relationship between inputs and outputs has changed, what would that be?

Matt Clancy
I mean, I think the sense people have is that one argument you could make is each scientist, he works for a certain amount of time, he does some experiments, he gets some kind of output and he publishes a paper on it. And in fact, if you look at that, papers per scientist, they’re going way up. They’re actually tracking each other, as you would expect. So it’s not that the people are struggling to find publishable outputs, but that’s not translating into the same level of productivity growth. And there’s a famous paper by some economists called (Are) Ideas Getting Harder to Find? That tries to look at a bunch of other proxies besides just productivity growth. So they look at yield growth in agriculture. They look at chip density in Moore’s law, they look at firm levels, proxies for sort of how much profitable firms are getting. And other people have looked at even other things like the rate of improvement on machine learning benchmarks and the number of patents that introduce novel ideas. These all paint a similar picture of, on a per-person basis, we’re not getting as many of these things as we used to.

John Burn-Murdoch
Got it. And taking something, whether it’s those citations, the significance of each marginal academic paper or something like patents, what’s the time scale look like here? Is this something that was improving over a period and then it’s started getting worse? Is it something that is still improving but slowing down? And to the extent that there is an inflection point, when do we seem to see that?

Matt Clancy
So one thing that we can track for a really long time is productivity of the US economy relative to the number of researchers, and that has just been declining since, like the ‘30s. The increase in productivity relative to the supply of research effort. If you look at different subsectors like medical innovation, but not just life expectancy, drilling down into specific diseases like breast cancer and so forth, you can see different shapes then. There’s sort of a general trend towards this decline where you get less gains for more effort. In this case, they measure effort by things like the number of clinical trials or the number of papers being published on these diseases, but it’s bumpier, right? There are times when we make breakthroughs and suddenly we’re getting a lot of gains relative to the research effort we put in. But there’s a general tendency that those dissipate over a while and we return to this sort of slide.

John Burn-Murdoch
Got it. And so it seems to me the time scales are maybe not super precise, but this is a general trend that we see across a few different metrics. I’m going to ask the laziest question possible, which is what do we think is going on? Why would things have slowed down? Or to use your preferred framing, got harder in that time?

Matt Clancy
There’s a ton of reasons, but I think one obvious big one you kind of alluded to, you said natural biological limits, why we might not expect life to get easier, but there could be just natural limits to everything. And everything gets harder, like making advances in physics. You used to be able to measure the voltage of an electron with oil drop experiments, and now you need the Large Hadron Collider. And so if that’s just the way the world works, then that’s what you expect. And there’s nothing dysfunctional or anything about it.

But that explanation is not entirely satisfying for a lot of people because science also has this tendency to discover new fields and new vistas. And when those opened up, you should think this resets the clock, right? We’re back to being able to make the easy discoveries. And so you could ask, why are those new vistas not opening up fast enough that we keep making the same rapid progress in those new fields, maybe that we didn’t in other fields?

John Burn-Murdoch
And so you kind of alluded to the greater complexity of new discoveries now, right? If we go back long enough ago, someone figured out fire or figured out the wheel. But innovations in energy or transport these days, the amount of stuff you need to know even to be possible that you would move things forward is vastly greater. Is that something that you think just on a basic level is likely to be an issue, here?

Matt Clancy
Completely. There’s an economist, Ben Jones, who’s pioneered this model called the Burden of Knowledge model, where the idea is answering new questions requires you to know something that people didn’t know before because otherwise it would have been answered earlier. And that means that as we progress, we have to know more and more. Sometimes what we learn displaces other things and we learn that we are wrong. There’s sort of a Kuhnian paradigm shift. But it just seems to be the case that normally there’s a ratchet and you have to know more and more.

And Jones’ paper has some really interesting implications that it documents empirically. Like, it shows that this can explain why the size of teams among scientists is rising because it takes more and more knowledge and you need more and more heads basically to hold all this knowledge to apply to a problem. And we see this across lots of fields of science — almost all of them. The number of co-authors on a paper is going up. He also says this implies people are going to specialise more because rather than trying to learn everything, you’re going to specialise and work in a team. And we’ve seen this too — there’s more and more specialisation in science and people are working on narrower and narrower niches. And he also says people are going to spend more time in training and education because it just takes longer to learn all this knowledge. And again, he documents that the age at which people make their first great discovery like he has a data set of Nobel Prize winners and the age at which they make their Nobel Prize-winning discovery has gone up.

But you see this again across like what’s the age at which people write their first paper? That’s gone up across lots of different fields, too. And so this is one way that things get harder. I think you kind of expect that if it takes a bigger team, then you’re going to have basically more researchers per problem of a similar size. There could be also issues related to working in a team as it produces its own sort of inefficiencies compared to a lone genius being able to just do everything on their own. Age has its own potential downsides. Specialisation has its own possible knock-on effects, too. So there’s a lot that could be going on in there just from this burden of knowledge story.

John Burn-Murdoch
Got it. So there’s this real sense that just on a personal level, the number of people, the number of specialisms, perhaps the number of people in different locations required to produce a given insight has ballooned. Now, does that mean that we could be on the cusp of a new leap forward? If we think about things like AI, particularly large language models, their ability to summarise and synthesise and translate? Is it possible that we’ve been in this trough in terms of the difficulty of doing this stuff that we might be about to break out of?

Matt Clancy
It’s possible. I think that you do see evidence that for a big team, it can be hard to communicate these ideas across people like your intuition suggests. There’s a famous paper that looks at the size of a team and how disruptive is the idea. And the sort of smaller teams have these more disruptive ideas than larger teams, which is surprising if you imagine that making a disruptive ideas about forming a connection between different ideas, you would think like a big team would have more ideas, but maybe it’s just they’ll stay locked in their different silos in people’s heads compared to if they’re all bouncing around while you’re in the shower or something. So in that sense, large language models, if they can help overcome that problem, it’s certainly possible. It’s too early to know if this is working, but maybe you don’t have to master so much detail. You can master maybe high-level stuff and use the large language model as the auxiliary to help you fill out the details. But it’s just not clear yet if those details are really the things that matter for spotting these connections.

John Burn-Murdoch
I guess another one, and you touched on this, but it strikes me as particularly plausible that this could be having an impact is just demographics. If we think about falling birth rates, ageing populations, and of course there are different parts of the world where there are more young people, but the parts of the world that have the resources to be doing this work have all got older. As you said earlier, the time that they finish formal education and are able to start doing this sort of blue sky research later and later. How much do you think the simple maths of that is having an impact?

Matt Clancy
There’s two ways that you can think of age mattering. There’s the individual productivity. Like just as I get older, am I less inventive as a researcher? And then there’s this ecological level where there’s more senior people around choosing how funding gets allocated or setting the culture, does that have an effect? And the first one of these has been studied quite a lot about how does the research productivity of a person vary over their lifetime? And there’s some interesting evidence that basically people are able to produce high-impact work for a long time in a research career, like maybe the first 25 years that they’re working. We are seeing an increase in the number of people who are more than 25 years into their career. And so that’s potentially a concern.

But I think this ecological issue is potentially more serious and is a little bit less studied. There’s a famous paper — they find two scientists who are similar to each other in various ways, except one of them has this unexpected tragedy where they die. And they look at what happens to the evolution of the fields that these two scientists work on and the one where there was an unexpected death has new people come into the field, they’re citing different literature, They’re bringing in new keywords. And so there’s the sense that there’s this turnover brings in new ideas. And if you have a population that’s ageing and there’s just less of that natural turnover, whether it’s through retirement or other things — it doesn’t have to be always a tragedy — that could potentially slow over the churn of new ideas. But I think this is a lot less studied and maybe it is just hard to study too.

John Burn-Murdoch
Yeah, I guess the sort of randomised controlled trial here would be like let’s kill a lot of Nobel laureates in one field and see what happens.

Matt Clancy
Maybe not. We could maybe just give them a nice retirement and that might pass IRB better.

John Burn-Murdoch
Absolutely. But no, that’s really interesting to think about. Another one that strikes me now, this might just be me searching for a sexy narrative that doesn’t hold up, but it strikes me that we’ve not had open conflict or even thinly veiled conflict between some of the great powers in the world for some time now. Of course, there’s an argument to be made that the US versus China is getting close to what US-Russia was in, say, the ‘50s and ‘60s. But could parts of this be that there was just that much more urgency in the past because there was something existential about the need to be ahead of enemies or at least of serious rivals to discover some of these things, especially in the sort of materials and technology space. And now there’s just, you know, people are working hard, but they don’t feel like their lives or their country depend on it.

Matt Clancy
I think that seems possible when you’re thinking about urgency and not being in an active war situation. When you’re in an active war, there’s short-term and long-term effects on innovation that go in quite different directions. So in the short term, like in World War Two, you know, you got the surge of effort to develop and make ready and usable these advanced technologies: radar, industrial-scale penicillin and of course the atomic bomb and so forth. But all of those were built on deep foundations of science that had been done for a long time in peacetime. And if you look at what happened to the advance of that kind of fundamental research during, say, World War Two, that was just put on the back shelf. There’s quotes from people who are active in managing the innovation, wartime efforts that, you know, they’ll just say explicitly, like everybody was working on application. Time was of the essence. There was no time for sort of basic, pure science. And so that’s a long-run effect that’s potentially detrimental.

But if you look in the very long run, I think there is something to your argument in the sense that after World War Two, it validated how important science was from a national security angle. And modern governments involvement in research was really catalysed by the experience in World War Two that led to the creation of the National Science Foundation, the great expansion of the National Institutes of Health for funding research and our modern research ecosystem, for better or worse. It stuck around, even though maybe we don’t feel like we have that wartime effort right now. But that’s potentially a role like you surmised.

John Burn-Murdoch
Right. And I guess maybe cold war or sort of room temperature war, as it were, there’s some optimum there where you’re not having to throw away all the fundamental research and just make physical things. But there is still this sense of competition. The example that comes to mind is people talk about the chip war at the moment, and there’s this real sense that there is a America versus China, or at least the west versus China element to this, which means there’s probably that bit more efforts and certainly money being poured into this than they would be if it was just about making chips faster for the sake of it.

Matt Clancy
Yeah. I mean, I think that you could imagine there’s an optimum level of how far is your horizon, right? Like if things are not going to matter for a thousand years, there’s not the urgency. But if getting a result today is the thing that matters, then you have no ability to invest in these long-run things. And so you want the spot in the middle where people feel it’s important to invest in longer-run things that will take decades to play out, but it’s still worth doing. Maybe war can provide that function, but hopefully there are other things that are not so disastrous for us that can do it too.

John Burn-Murdoch
Yeah. So, so far I’ve suggested mass death and war, and you’ve disappointingly said neither of them are likely to work.

Just one other pet theory of mine and theory of many peoples comes down to money. So there’s two ways that I think about this. One is, is it possibly the case that there is simply so much money to be made now outside of fundamental scientific research? So if we think about financial sector or the consumer-oriented digital tech space, those would be two examples that are perhaps spaces where someone who would 50 years ago have gone on to be a brilliant scientist is now going more into the commercial space. The other angle on this is that more scientific research is perhaps now being done in private sector, in firms than by nation states. And perhaps more of the fundamental stuff happens outside of the private space. Any water in those theories?

Matt Clancy
Yeah. So I think people are actively researching the first question you had about how the attractiveness of different jobs pulls people out of science and into different sectors. On the second one, there’s been a consistent story where more of the basic science is done in universities and non-profits than in the heyday of the corporate lab. You can think of Bell Labs, Xerox Parc and things like that. And the reason we ended up there makes sense from the perspective of a firm — they found that investing in basic science was increasingly going to benefit rival firms. The scientific publications put out by these corporate labs was increasingly cited by the patents of rival firms, and so they stopped doing that.

There’s also a tendency for firms to specialise over time, and when you’re specialised that makes undirected exploratory knowledge less appealing. It just becomes less likely that an unanticipated application is going to benefit your narrow line of business. And since that’s probably true, I think we do need to build new kinds of bridges between where the basic science is happening. And that’s sort of the kind of stuff that I don’t know we might think about in the innovation policy programme. (inaudible), take a circle back to that is here’s how the innovation landscape has changed. Here’s maybe a new missing middle and what are the kinds of structures that can help solve that? It’s just one example of the kinds of things we might think about.

John Burn-Murdoch
So, Matt, we’ve talked a lot here about the potential problems or drags or bits of friction that have caused that research productivity to decline. I think this is a good time for us to go for a break. When we come back, we’ll throw this forward. And I’m going to ask, what would you want to see done to change this or to get a better idea of what we need to change?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

So Matt, throwing this forward, we talked a lot about what might be going wrong or what might be causing the line to slope upwards less steeply, shall we say, what are the things you would want to see changed here, whether that’s new research to get better answers to what the fundamental issues are or actual changes in policy or that kind of thing.

Matt Clancy
So I think the big vision is that you want science to be more experimental and evidence-based, but about itself. So all the different components of science, the different players, that’s the funders of science, the labs that are doing the science, the training programs, the journals, the conferences, everybody is experimenting with different ways of doing things and not just assuming that the way we’ve done it since the ‘60s is the right way. And when we try new things, do it in a rigorous experiment or a study where we can assess the effects and try to develop an evidence base about better ways of doing things.

John Burn-Murdoch
Got it. So what’s an example of something that you think is perhaps suboptimal in the way science is carried out at the moment and perhaps another domain that does that better?

Matt Clancy
All right. So one example is another group that has to pick among risky things to fund. So science funders have to decide without all the information, which research project they’re going to fund. The way they do it typically is through peer review, consensus and so forth.

But lots of people have to pick what to invest in without knowing the outcomes. Silicon Valley or venture capitalists are one example of a group that has to do this with a lot of uncertainty, and they sometimes use different practices, and maybe we want to try those practices in how we pick science projects.

For example, some Silicon Valley firms might have what’s called sometimes a “golden ticket system” where one partner can say, basically, I believe in this project, I want to fund it and even though their peers disagree, it gets picked and that gives some more variance. And, you know, it’s not all consensus-driven. You can imagine doing the same thing in science where peer reviewers, for example, are given one voucher that they can say, I want this project to go through and we don’t need consensus on this. I just really believe in it.

John Burn-Murdoch
And what leads you to think that would be an improvement and produce better results?

Matt Clancy
So I’d say two things. One is I don’t know if it’s an improvement, and this is why we have to experiment and try new things. But I think that it’s worth trying. You know, there’s a general sense that science in picking projects can be conservative and not pick things that are out of the norm. And there’s some evidence about this. For example, if a scientist has tended to work on strange or more novel projects that, for example, they try to assess the novelty by, is this person’s work cite journals that are not normally cited together. This is one very crude way they try to assess novelty. And in one study, for example, these kind of people have a tougher time getting funded by an agency.

John Burn-Murdoch
Yeah. Got it. So you’re maybe you end up with a bit of herding in the existing system where people go for safer bets. Kind of makes sense if this is what people’s jobs and funding depends on. And what we need is the more sort of high variance, high risk, but potentially high reward approach that is deployed in spaces like venture capital.

Matt Clancy
Yeah, I think that’s the theory. I think there’s a sense in which a lot of science is disproportionately driven by big breakthroughs, big discoveries, new paradigms, new theories, and you want a system that swings for the fences perhaps more often than it currently does.

John Burn-Murdoch
And how would you go about doing this? Is this something that fundamentally you just need a bunch of people very high up in the scientific research space to decide, or is this something that can be done in a more start-up or upstart way in one place at one time?

Matt Clancy
So I think there is interest in this at top levels in government. So in the UK there’s a UK Metascience Unit that does sort of this style of they are trying to run experiments in how the UK government chooses what projects to fund and identify better ways to do that. We’re actually contributing to a request for research proposals. When I say we, I mean Open Philanthropy.

But like I said, there’s lots of players in the scientific ecosystem. There’s journals, there’s universities, and you can imagine all of these groups trying things on their own. I think one challenge and maybe one thing that needs a little co-ordination is you often need a big sample to learn something. And so there’s a role for groups to sort of knit together and join forces to run experiments or try things at a scale where you could learn from them. But there’s lots of people who can maybe do this.

John Burn-Murdoch
Got it. Now we’re drawing to a natural end here. So I’m going to ask one final question, which is we’ve talked about problems and challenges here, we’ve thrown out a couple of solutions, how optimistic are you that the hit rate, the productivity of research and progress itself might return to a more steeply upward-sloping trend?

Matt Clancy
So I’m an optimist by temperament, I think. Maybe not well-founded in the evidence, but I’m pretty optimistic. I do think you could point to a few things. There’s a lot of energy and excitement around science reform, innovation policy. The UK Metascience Unit is just one example. But in the US there’s similar kinds of interest in experimenting with some of how we fund science and so forth.

And then on the other side, we’re living through this kind of technological revolution — AI is making these huge advances and it seems quite likely that it will have some kind of beneficial impact on science. Science doesn’t always have to get worse. Sometimes there are breakthroughs and the productivity of science goes up for a while. And I would bet that if that did happen, AI plays a role in it.

John Burn-Murdoch
Got it. So it’s not all doom and gloom, and it may be the breakthrough innovations that we’re waiting for will actually come from a large language model or something like that rather than a human.

Matt Clancy
I’d say maybe a human working together with a large language model is pretty promising. You get the strengths of both (inaudible)

John Burn-Murdoch
Absolutely. It’s always a lazy sort of dichotomy of the two. Yeah, collaboration is better. Well, Matt, thank you so much for joining us. It’s been a real pleasure to chat through all this with you.

Matt Clancy
Thanks for having me.

Hello, I am John Burn-Murdoch, sitting in for Soumaya Keynes on the FT’s Economics Show. In my day job, I crunch data and make charts for the FT in my weekly column, Data Points. And a few months back, I wrote a column arguing that the west was shifting away from a culture of progressive, of moving fast, breaking things and towards one more concerned with caution and perhaps risk or inequality. And the theory I was setting out was that a lot of what determines how economies function, what they do and how they grow is how we think about or talk about innovation and progress on a societal level. Shortly afterwards, someone wrote a very interesting response, pushing back, I think, on some of the things I was saying, but bringing a lot more material to the discussion. And that was my guest today, Matt Clancy. [MUSIC PLAYING] So, Matt, hello. Thanks for being here. Now, by way of introduction, can you tell us a little bit about who you are, what you do and why the debate about what produces progress is a matter close to your heart? Matt Clancy
Yeah. So by training, I’m an academic economist and I specialised in the economics of science and innovation and used to teach at university, worked for government. But now I am at Open Philanthropy. We’re a grantmaker, and I run the innovation policy programme there, which makes grants to try to accelerate scientific and technological progress. And so as part of that, you know, we’re trying to understand how do you make science and innovation go better. And I think one avenue that you explore is, has it gotten worse? And if so, why? John Burn-Murdoch
Can you elaborate for a second on Open Philanthropy? Matt Clancy
Yeah. So it’s an organisation that was founded, I think, originally to disperse and give away one wealthy person’s money, but we’ve since sort of expanded and now recommend grants to multiple organisations and people and so forth. And they’re based in Silicon Valley, although I work remotely from Iowa. John Burn-Murdoch
Maybe to set the scene, there are various people who’ve had theories on what caused the Industrial Revolution to take place — when and where it did. Now, I think for listeners of a show produced by the FT, they’re probably more familiar with the view of someone like Robert Allen, who argues that this was fundamentally all about economics. You had a situation where the UK at the time had particularly expensive wage costs, expensive labour and cheap and abundant energy. And with those ingredients there, it was almost inevitable that it would pursue industry before the people. So if we say that’s the sort of classical view, maybe you’re playing devil’s advocate here and this isn’t what you believe yourself, but could you tell us what the sort of culture-driving progress theory looks like? Matt Clancy
Sure. I think the alternative theory is best explained by this economist Joel Mokyr, who’s an economic historian. And he kind of saw the industrial revolution as stemming from a confluence of several factors. There was a growing base of what he calls “useful knowledge”. So that’s broader than just science. There was a skilled artisanal network of people who could make use of that knowledge. But kind of a key interesting idea he has, especially for, I guess, an economist, is that he thinks the belief in the possibility of progress and the perfectibility of human institutions and sort of an interest in worldly things was this key idea and something that was perhaps not new. Maybe things like that had sometimes bubbled up in culture, but the conditions were right in Britain at that time and in Scotland and so forth, for an interest in progress and to try to figure out how to do things better could actually work and prove itself. And that became self-sustaining. John Burn-Murdoch
Got it. Thank you. And I guess it’s worth emphasising here as well that this sounds kind of obvious today, right? The idea that we, as both individuals and societies might take it upon ourselves to improve our lot, to make our lives better or at least different. Whereas if you go back to, say, the 1500s, 1600s, there hadn’t been much change on the sort of grand historical scale in living standards in the way things worked for a very, very long time, right? And these were very religious societies. There was a sense that you get what you’re given and maybe you look to the heavens if you want to have a better year next year than you had before. And so this idea of just thinking the world we live in today and the way we interact with it and the way things look doesn’t necessarily need to be the world tomorrow. We can actually take an active part in changing that. This was very novel, right? Matt Clancy
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, as you say, if you think back to how your life differs from your grandparents today, it’s quite a lot. You know, we hear the stories of how hard things were, but it wouldn’t have been that way back then. Just as long as you wanted to look back, things were the same, or in some cases, you might have believed they were better. John Burn-Murdoch
Absolutely. And so I guess that was part of what prompted this super interesting paper that came out in 2023. Title: Enlightenment Ideals and Belief in Progress in the Run-up to the Industrial Revolution: A Textual Analysis. So this was by Ali Almelhem and co-authors, including Jared Rubin — who some listeners might be familiar with. And I guess the novel approach and insight that they took here was to say, OK, like the Mokyr theory, there is very well put together, it makes a lot of sense. How can we quantify the extent to which this was a thing that happened? So they did textual analysis on hundreds of thousands of books that had been published in the period of interest. So we’re talking 15, 16, 1700s and beyond. And they looked at how the language of these books, first of all, could be split down into different categories. So books about religion, books more about science, books more about the political economy and how the structure of that writing changed over time. And also just how the frequency or type of different language used in these books evolved.  And they found something which I guess, we could at least say is consistent with Mokyr’s theory, which is that in the English language bibliography, as it were, of the time, you saw, first of all, this growth in books that were written in that political economy space and in the science space as well. And that there was a sense that the language used in these books was also perhaps evolving to talk more about these concepts of empiricism, experimentation, scientific method. I guess my reading of this paper as I expanded on in my piece was that it’s at least consistent with that theory that to the extent that language is a proxy for culture. There were changes going on here which would fit the idea that Britain and the English language was undergoing an evolution here, which teed it up for a more sort of hands-on approach to the betterment of individuals in society. Tell me where you disagree with that or does that sound about that? Matt Clancy
I think that sounds like a pretty good summary. I mean, I think that maybe the slight tweaks is that they really look for what they call sort of progress-oriented language — you know, improvement, advance, rise. And I think they draw an interesting contrast to what they just called optimism. So there’s a distinction between making things better and just thinking things are good. And they show that language related to optimism had been there for a while, and it was in some of these religious texts. But language related to progress was centred on this political economy and to some degree, some of the scientific text which had grown in the run-up to the Industrial Revolution. John Burn-Murdoch
Yeah, exactly. It’s that practical taking a greater agency in the future, I guess you could talk about. And so I guess, first of all, the high-level question here: to what extent do you think that analysing large corpuses of text is a useful way of tracking what the culture of the day in a given place was? Matt Clancy
It’s like looking under the lamppost problem, right? Where like, it’s there, we can do something with it. I think it’s interesting and worth doing. I think the issue is that with these corpuses, the frequency of words like progress can change for various reasons. It can change just because there’s an explosion of writing, say, about science and there’s a bunch of new scientific articles being written and maybe they don’t talk about progress because they’re being, you know, neutral language and so forth. But maybe that doesn’t reflect the actual progress attitudes. I guess another critique you sometimes hear is that one or two books that are super influential that everybody reads can be really representative of a group’s view. And the overall use of the word across every book is less represented. I mean, if you look at the Google data, I think the frequency of words like teeth or nose, bounce around in strange ways that don’t seem to reflect our interest in those topics. John Burn-Murdoch
Right. Exactly. A great example. And I guess there’s also issues with, for example, one thing I looked at in my piece was using risk as another keyword to monitor perhaps the emergence of a more cautious culture. But of course, the emergence of financial markets leads to a lot of discussion about risk in a way that isn’t really to do with that at all. So there are definitely pitfalls here. And I guess that brings me onto the next question, which is I think perhaps where there was some of the most creative tension, as it were, between your response in my original piece was I was trying to throw this forward and say, OK, well, to the limited extent that we think word count, well, term frequency — to give it a more respectable name — can be a proxy for the culture of the day. Looking at some of that data in Google Ngram — where they’ve digitised all these millions of books — suggested that while there was this big increase in terms to do with progress in the pursuit of betterment over, say, the 1500s through to around the 1960s, which is an inflection point we might come on to, my contention was that it looks as though that evolution of language may have started going in the opposite direction over the 60 or so years since. So discussion about betterment, about hands-on attempts to improve our lot may have started declining. Now, I think this is perhaps a particular space where you would maybe come to a different opinion or argue at least that the evidence we have is maybe not strong enough to say that. Matt Clancy
I think that the timing of when there was this decline, I’m more uncertain about it than maybe the chart that you put up in the original piece indicates. And I have just more uncertainty about whether the use of language is reflecting technological progress. Maybe people write more about progress when they see it happening, but it’s actually being driven by some third other thing that we don’t observe. But I think it’s quite plausible that attitudes towards progress affect people’s . . . what the careers they choose, how a society supports innovation to regulation — things like that. John Burn-Murdoch
Totally take that on board. So I guess maybe the problem here is that progress is such a fuzzy concept that we better to focus on something a bit more concrete, a bit more tangible, like the pace of innovation out of scientific research. And so this is where obviously you’ve done an enormous amount of work. So if I said to you that it feels like innovation and research and these more tangible measures of progress, I guess we could say, if I said to you it feels like that itself is slowing down, would you say that’s fair or would you take a more nuanced take on that? Matt Clancy
I think slowing down is hard to know and hard to justify. The kind of two big things that economists might look at is health and income, and particularly like productivity growth. Productivity growth has declined since the ‘60s, which is kind of interesting given that that’s when you found this progress language decline. And also, if you look at health gains, life expectancy, for example, in the United States increases linearly over a very long period of time. But what’s interesting is, you know, these changes are not enormous and, you know, maybe slowing down a little bit on the productivity side. But the amount of effort that we have put into research has grown enormously over that same time period. And I think that’s something that’s pretty hard to deny is that average research productivity or the average discovery per scientist or per worker that impacts health and income and lots of other things. That has to have gone down a lot simply because we’re pouring a lot more energy into that than we were years ago. John Burn-Murdoch
Got it. So I guess the sort of argument here is not that the pace at which the world moves forward itself is slowing down, but given the vast amounts, more human power and money and time being put into this, the sort of hit rate is coming down. Matt Clancy
Yeah. I mean, we’re running faster to stay in the same place. For the last, I don’t know, 50, 60 years, the US, for example, has poured about 3 per cent of GDP into R&D pretty consistently. But over that time period, the size of our GDP has grown substantially. And we’re investing a constant share of that growing pie into R&D without seeing faster rates of productivity growth, faster rates of life expectancy gains. People debate whether we should expect to see that or not, but it seems to me pretty undeniable that on a per scientist, per researcher level, what we’re getting from them is declining. John Burn-Murdoch
Totally. And so picking up when you mention things like life expectancy now, I can obviously imagine an argument that says, look, there are fundamental biological constraints. That means that we shouldn’t expect that to increase at a constant rate over time. But would it be something like GDP or productivity if we were looking for an indicator that you think we really should expect to continue increasing a given rate relative to its inputs and therefore something where the relationship between inputs and outputs has changed, what would that be? Matt Clancy
I mean, I think the sense people have is that one argument you could make is each scientist, he works for a certain amount of time, he does some experiments, he gets some kind of output and he publishes a paper on it. And in fact, if you look at that, papers per scientist, they’re going way up. They’re actually tracking each other, as you would expect. So it’s not that the people are struggling to find publishable outputs, but that’s not translating into the same level of productivity growth. And there’s a famous paper by some economists called (Are) Ideas Getting Harder to Find? That tries to look at a bunch of other proxies besides just productivity growth. So they look at yield growth in agriculture. They look at chip density in Moore’s law, they look at firm levels, proxies for sort of how much profitable firms are getting. And other people have looked at even other things like the rate of improvement on machine learning benchmarks and the number of patents that introduce novel ideas. These all paint a similar picture of, on a per-person basis, we’re not getting as many of these things as we used to. John Burn-Murdoch
Got it. And taking something, whether it’s those citations, the significance of each marginal academic paper or something like patents, what’s the time scale look like here? Is this something that was improving over a period and then it’s started getting worse? Is it something that is still improving but slowing down? And to the extent that there is an inflection point, when do we seem to see that? Matt Clancy
So one thing that we can track for a really long time is productivity of the US economy relative to the number of researchers, and that has just been declining since, like the ‘30s. The increase in productivity relative to the supply of research effort. If you look at different subsectors like medical innovation, but not just life expectancy, drilling down into specific diseases like breast cancer and so forth, you can see different shapes then. There’s sort of a general trend towards this decline where you get less gains for more effort. In this case, they measure effort by things like the number of clinical trials or the number of papers being published on these diseases, but it’s bumpier, right? There are times when we make breakthroughs and suddenly we’re getting a lot of gains relative to the research effort we put in. But there’s a general tendency that those dissipate over a while and we return to this sort of slide. John Burn-Murdoch
Got it. And so it seems to me the time scales are maybe not super precise, but this is a general trend that we see across a few different metrics. I’m going to ask the laziest question possible, which is what do we think is going on? Why would things have slowed down? Or to use your preferred framing, got harder in that time? Matt Clancy
There’s a ton of reasons, but I think one obvious big one you kind of alluded to, you said natural biological limits, why we might not expect life to get easier, but there could be just natural limits to everything. And everything gets harder, like making advances in physics. You used to be able to measure the voltage of an electron with oil drop experiments, and now you need the Large Hadron Collider. And so if that’s just the way the world works, then that’s what you expect. And there’s nothing dysfunctional or anything about it. But that explanation is not entirely satisfying for a lot of people because science also has this tendency to discover new fields and new vistas. And when those opened up, you should think this resets the clock, right? We’re back to being able to make the easy discoveries. And so you could ask, why are those new vistas not opening up fast enough that we keep making the same rapid progress in those new fields, maybe that we didn’t in other fields? John Burn-Murdoch
And so you kind of alluded to the greater complexity of new discoveries now, right? If we go back long enough ago, someone figured out fire or figured out the wheel. But innovations in energy or transport these days, the amount of stuff you need to know even to be possible that you would move things forward is vastly greater. Is that something that you think just on a basic level is likely to be an issue, here? Matt Clancy
Completely. There’s an economist, Ben Jones, who’s pioneered this model called the Burden of Knowledge model, where the idea is answering new questions requires you to know something that people didn’t know before because otherwise it would have been answered earlier. And that means that as we progress, we have to know more and more. Sometimes what we learn displaces other things and we learn that we are wrong. There’s sort of a Kuhnian paradigm shift. But it just seems to be the case that normally there’s a ratchet and you have to know more and more. And Jones’ paper has some really interesting implications that it documents empirically. Like, it shows that this can explain why the size of teams among scientists is rising because it takes more and more knowledge and you need more and more heads basically to hold all this knowledge to apply to a problem. And we see this across lots of fields of science — almost all of them. The number of co-authors on a paper is going up. He also says this implies people are going to specialise more because rather than trying to learn everything, you’re going to specialise and work in a team. And we’ve seen this too — there’s more and more specialisation in science and people are working on narrower and narrower niches. And he also says people are going to spend more time in training and education because it just takes longer to learn all this knowledge. And again, he documents that the age at which people make their first great discovery like he has a data set of Nobel Prize winners and the age at which they make their Nobel Prize-winning discovery has gone up.  But you see this again across like what’s the age at which people write their first paper? That’s gone up across lots of different fields, too. And so this is one way that things get harder. I think you kind of expect that if it takes a bigger team, then you’re going to have basically more researchers per problem of a similar size. There could be also issues related to working in a team as it produces its own sort of inefficiencies compared to a lone genius being able to just do everything on their own. Age has its own potential downsides. Specialisation has its own possible knock-on effects, too. So there’s a lot that could be going on in there just from this burden of knowledge story. John Burn-Murdoch
Got it. So there’s this real sense that just on a personal level, the number of people, the number of specialisms, perhaps the number of people in different locations required to produce a given insight has ballooned. Now, does that mean that we could be on the cusp of a new leap forward? If we think about things like AI, particularly large language models, their ability to summarise and synthesise and translate? Is it possible that we’ve been in this trough in terms of the difficulty of doing this stuff that we might be about to break out of? Matt Clancy
It’s possible. I think that you do see evidence that for a big team, it can be hard to communicate these ideas across people like your intuition suggests. There’s a famous paper that looks at the size of a team and how disruptive is the idea. And the sort of smaller teams have these more disruptive ideas than larger teams, which is surprising if you imagine that making a disruptive ideas about forming a connection between different ideas, you would think like a big team would have more ideas, but maybe it’s just they’ll stay locked in their different silos in people’s heads compared to if they’re all bouncing around while you’re in the shower or something. So in that sense, large language models, if they can help overcome that problem, it’s certainly possible. It’s too early to know if this is working, but maybe you don’t have to master so much detail. You can master maybe high-level stuff and use the large language model as the auxiliary to help you fill out the details. But it’s just not clear yet if those details are really the things that matter for spotting these connections. John Burn-Murdoch
I guess another one, and you touched on this, but it strikes me as particularly plausible that this could be having an impact is just demographics. If we think about falling birth rates, ageing populations, and of course there are different parts of the world where there are more young people, but the parts of the world that have the resources to be doing this work have all got older. As you said earlier, the time that they finish formal education and are able to start doing this sort of blue sky research later and later. How much do you think the simple maths of that is having an impact? Matt Clancy
There’s two ways that you can think of age mattering. There’s the individual productivity. Like just as I get older, am I less inventive as a researcher? And then there’s this ecological level where there’s more senior people around choosing how funding gets allocated or setting the culture, does that have an effect? And the first one of these has been studied quite a lot about how does the research productivity of a person vary over their lifetime? And there’s some interesting evidence that basically people are able to produce high-impact work for a long time in a research career, like maybe the first 25 years that they’re working. We are seeing an increase in the number of people who are more than 25 years into their career. And so that’s potentially a concern. But I think this ecological issue is potentially more serious and is a little bit less studied. There’s a famous paper — they find two scientists who are similar to each other in various ways, except one of them has this unexpected tragedy where they die. And they look at what happens to the evolution of the fields that these two scientists work on and the one where there was an unexpected death has new people come into the field, they’re citing different literature, They’re bringing in new keywords. And so there’s the sense that there’s this turnover brings in new ideas. And if you have a population that’s ageing and there’s just less of that natural turnover, whether it’s through retirement or other things — it doesn’t have to be always a tragedy — that could potentially slow over the churn of new ideas. But I think this is a lot less studied and maybe it is just hard to study too. John Burn-Murdoch
Yeah, I guess the sort of randomised controlled trial here would be like let’s kill a lot of Nobel laureates in one field and see what happens. Matt Clancy
Maybe not. We could maybe just give them a nice retirement and that might pass IRB better. John Burn-Murdoch
Absolutely. But no, that’s really interesting to think about. Another one that strikes me now, this might just be me searching for a sexy narrative that doesn’t hold up, but it strikes me that we’ve not had open conflict or even thinly veiled conflict between some of the great powers in the world for some time now. Of course, there’s an argument to be made that the US versus China is getting close to what US-Russia was in, say, the ‘50s and ‘60s. But could parts of this be that there was just that much more urgency in the past because there was something existential about the need to be ahead of enemies or at least of serious rivals to discover some of these things, especially in the sort of materials and technology space. And now there’s just, you know, people are working hard, but they don’t feel like their lives or their country depend on it. Matt Clancy
I think that seems possible when you’re thinking about urgency and not being in an active war situation. When you’re in an active war, there’s short-term and long-term effects on innovation that go in quite different directions. So in the short term, like in World War Two, you know, you got the surge of effort to develop and make ready and usable these advanced technologies: radar, industrial-scale penicillin and of course the atomic bomb and so forth. But all of those were built on deep foundations of science that had been done for a long time in peacetime. And if you look at what happened to the advance of that kind of fundamental research during, say, World War Two, that was just put on the back shelf. There’s quotes from people who are active in managing the innovation, wartime efforts that, you know, they’ll just say explicitly, like everybody was working on application. Time was of the essence. There was no time for sort of basic, pure science. And so that’s a long-run effect that’s potentially detrimental. But if you look in the very long run, I think there is something to your argument in the sense that after World War Two, it validated how important science was from a national security angle. And modern governments involvement in research was really catalysed by the experience in World War Two that led to the creation of the National Science Foundation, the great expansion of the National Institutes of Health for funding research and our modern research ecosystem, for better or worse. It stuck around, even though maybe we don’t feel like we have that wartime effort right now. But that’s potentially a role like you surmised. John Burn-Murdoch
Right. And I guess maybe cold war or sort of room temperature war, as it were, there’s some optimum there where you’re not having to throw away all the fundamental research and just make physical things. But there is still this sense of competition. The example that comes to mind is people talk about the chip war at the moment, and there’s this real sense that there is a America versus China, or at least the west versus China element to this, which means there’s probably that bit more efforts and certainly money being poured into this than they would be if it was just about making chips faster for the sake of it. Matt Clancy
Yeah. I mean, I think that you could imagine there’s an optimum level of how far is your horizon, right? Like if things are not going to matter for a thousand years, there’s not the urgency. But if getting a result today is the thing that matters, then you have no ability to invest in these long-run things. And so you want the spot in the middle where people feel it’s important to invest in longer-run things that will take decades to play out, but it’s still worth doing. Maybe war can provide that function, but hopefully there are other things that are not so disastrous for us that can do it too. John Burn-Murdoch
Yeah. So, so far I’ve suggested mass death and war, and you’ve disappointingly said neither of them are likely to work. Just one other pet theory of mine and theory of many peoples comes down to money. So there’s two ways that I think about this. One is, is it possibly the case that there is simply so much money to be made now outside of fundamental scientific research? So if we think about financial sector or the consumer-oriented digital tech space, those would be two examples that are perhaps spaces where someone who would 50 years ago have gone on to be a brilliant scientist is now going more into the commercial space. The other angle on this is that more scientific research is perhaps now being done in private sector, in firms than by nation states. And perhaps more of the fundamental stuff happens outside of the private space. Any water in those theories? Matt Clancy
Yeah. So I think people are actively researching the first question you had about how the attractiveness of different jobs pulls people out of science and into different sectors. On the second one, there’s been a consistent story where more of the basic science is done in universities and non-profits than in the heyday of the corporate lab. You can think of Bell Labs, Xerox Parc and things like that. And the reason we ended up there makes sense from the perspective of a firm — they found that investing in basic science was increasingly going to benefit rival firms. The scientific publications put out by these corporate labs was increasingly cited by the patents of rival firms, and so they stopped doing that. There’s also a tendency for firms to specialise over time, and when you’re specialised that makes undirected exploratory knowledge less appealing. It just becomes less likely that an unanticipated application is going to benefit your narrow line of business. And since that’s probably true, I think we do need to build new kinds of bridges between where the basic science is happening. And that’s sort of the kind of stuff that I don’t know we might think about in the innovation policy programme. (inaudible), take a circle back to that is here’s how the innovation landscape has changed. Here’s maybe a new missing middle and what are the kinds of structures that can help solve that? It’s just one example of the kinds of things we might think about. John Burn-Murdoch
So, Matt, we’ve talked a lot here about the potential problems or drags or bits of friction that have caused that research productivity to decline. I think this is a good time for us to go for a break. When we come back, we’ll throw this forward. And I’m going to ask, what would you want to see done to change this or to get a better idea of what we need to change? [MUSIC PLAYING] So Matt, throwing this forward, we talked a lot about what might be going wrong or what might be causing the line to slope upwards less steeply, shall we say, what are the things you would want to see changed here, whether that’s new research to get better answers to what the fundamental issues are or actual changes in policy or that kind of thing. Matt Clancy
So I think the big vision is that you want science to be more experimental and evidence-based, but about itself. So all the different components of science, the different players, that’s the funders of science, the labs that are doing the science, the training programs, the journals, the conferences, everybody is experimenting with different ways of doing things and not just assuming that the way we’ve done it since the ‘60s is the right way. And when we try new things, do it in a rigorous experiment or a study where we can assess the effects and try to develop an evidence base about better ways of doing things. John Burn-Murdoch
Got it. So what’s an example of something that you think is perhaps suboptimal in the way science is carried out at the moment and perhaps another domain that does that better? Matt Clancy
All right. So one example is another group that has to pick among risky things to fund. So science funders have to decide without all the information, which research project they’re going to fund. The way they do it typically is through peer review, consensus and so forth. But lots of people have to pick what to invest in without knowing the outcomes. Silicon Valley or venture capitalists are one example of a group that has to do this with a lot of uncertainty, and they sometimes use different practices, and maybe we want to try those practices in how we pick science projects.  For example, some Silicon Valley firms might have what’s called sometimes a “golden ticket system” where one partner can say, basically, I believe in this project, I want to fund it and even though their peers disagree, it gets picked and that gives some more variance. And, you know, it’s not all consensus-driven. You can imagine doing the same thing in science where peer reviewers, for example, are given one voucher that they can say, I want this project to go through and we don’t need consensus on this. I just really believe in it. John Burn-Murdoch
And what leads you to think that would be an improvement and produce better results? Matt Clancy
So I’d say two things. One is I don’t know if it’s an improvement, and this is why we have to experiment and try new things. But I think that it’s worth trying. You know, there’s a general sense that science in picking projects can be conservative and not pick things that are out of the norm. And there’s some evidence about this. For example, if a scientist has tended to work on strange or more novel projects that, for example, they try to assess the novelty by, is this person’s work cite journals that are not normally cited together. This is one very crude way they try to assess novelty. And in one study, for example, these kind of people have a tougher time getting funded by an agency. John Burn-Murdoch
Yeah. Got it. So you’re maybe you end up with a bit of herding in the existing system where people go for safer bets. Kind of makes sense if this is what people’s jobs and funding depends on. And what we need is the more sort of high variance, high risk, but potentially high reward approach that is deployed in spaces like venture capital. Matt Clancy
Yeah, I think that’s the theory. I think there’s a sense in which a lot of science is disproportionately driven by big breakthroughs, big discoveries, new paradigms, new theories, and you want a system that swings for the fences perhaps more often than it currently does. John Burn-Murdoch
And how would you go about doing this? Is this something that fundamentally you just need a bunch of people very high up in the scientific research space to decide, or is this something that can be done in a more start-up or upstart way in one place at one time? Matt Clancy
So I think there is interest in this at top levels in government. So in the UK there’s a UK Metascience Unit that does sort of this style of they are trying to run experiments in how the UK government chooses what projects to fund and identify better ways to do that. We’re actually contributing to a request for research proposals. When I say we, I mean Open Philanthropy. But like I said, there’s lots of players in the scientific ecosystem. There’s journals, there’s universities, and you can imagine all of these groups trying things on their own. I think one challenge and maybe one thing that needs a little co-ordination is you often need a big sample to learn something. And so there’s a role for groups to sort of knit together and join forces to run experiments or try things at a scale where you could learn from them. But there’s lots of people who can maybe do this. John Burn-Murdoch
Got it. Now we’re drawing to a natural end here. So I’m going to ask one final question, which is we’ve talked about problems and challenges here, we’ve thrown out a couple of solutions, how optimistic are you that the hit rate, the productivity of research and progress itself might return to a more steeply upward-sloping trend? Matt Clancy
So I’m an optimist by temperament, I think. Maybe not well-founded in the evidence, but I’m pretty optimistic. I do think you could point to a few things. There’s a lot of energy and excitement around science reform, innovation policy. The UK Metascience Unit is just one example. But in the US there’s similar kinds of interest in experimenting with some of how we fund science and so forth. And then on the other side, we’re living through this kind of technological revolution — AI is making these huge advances and it seems quite likely that it will have some kind of beneficial impact on science. Science doesn’t always have to get worse. Sometimes there are breakthroughs and the productivity of science goes up for a while. And I would bet that if that did happen, AI plays a role in it. John Burn-Murdoch
Got it. So it’s not all doom and gloom, and it may be the breakthrough innovations that we’re waiting for will actually come from a large language model or something like that rather than a human. Matt Clancy
I’d say maybe a human working together with a large language model is pretty promising. You get the strengths of both (inaudible) John Burn-Murdoch
Absolutely. It’s always a lazy sort of dichotomy of the two. Yeah, collaboration is better. Well, Matt, thank you so much for joining us. It’s been a real pleasure to chat through all this with you. Matt Clancy

That is all for this week. You’ve been listening to The Economics Show. This episode was produced by Edith Rousselot. With original music from Breen Turner, edited by Bryant Urstadt. Our executive producer is Manuela Saragosa. Cheryl Brumley is the FT’s global head of audio. And I’m John Burn-Murdoch. Thanks for listening.",2025-02-09,This is an audio transcript of The Economics Show podcast episode,"In the Financial Times podcast episode with Matt Clancy, the discussion revolves around whether innovation is slowing down. Host John Burn-Murdoch introduces Clancy, an economist focused on science and innovation, who works at Open Philanthropy, a grantmaker aimed at accelerating progress in these areas.

The conversation delves into historical theories of the Industrial Revolution's onset, highlighting Joel Mokyr's view that a culture of belief in progress and ""useful knowledge"" was crucial. Clancy explores the evolution of language around progress, indicating that discussions about improvement have evolved since the 1500s and peaked around the 1960s, potentially suggesting a decline in progressive attitudes since then.

Both speakers debate whether innovation is indeed slowing. Clancy notes that while increased resources have been devoted to research, the productivity of that research—measured by outputs like life expectancy and productivity growth—has not improved proportionately. He cites the ""Burden of Knowledge"" theory that suggests as science advances, it requires more specialized knowledge, which may lead to diminishing returns in breakthrough discoveries.

Demographic changes, such as aging populations and low birth rates, and potential declines in urgency for innovation due to a lack of geopolitical conflict are also discussed. Clancy suggests that too much specialization and larger research teams may stifle creativity.

Looking forward, Clancy is optimistic, proposing that experimenting with different scientific funding methods—like those used in venture capital—could foster more innovative breakthroughs. He emphasizes the need for a collaborative approach between researchers and emerging technologies like AI, which may help rekindle scientific productivity.

Overall, Clancy advocates for a new, more experimental approach to science funding and innovation policy to counteract stagnation and enhance progress."

Martin Sandbu
Donald Trump has not wasted any time in his hurry to upend the global economic order. Last weekend, he imposed big tariffs on the US’s most important trading partners. He’s also passed sweeping orders to undo the industrial policy of his predecessor Joe Biden — a policy that itself was a break with the earlier economic policy consensus.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Welcome to The Economics Show. I am Martin Sandbu, the FT’s European economics commentator, and I’m guest-hosting our economics podcast, while our regular host, Soumaya Keynes, is on maternity leave. To help wrap our heads around President Trump’s policy moves and discuss how the world should respond, I’m joined by Dani Rodrik, professor of economics at Harvard University. Dani, welcome to the show.

Dani Rodrik
Nice to be with you, Martin.

Martin Sandbu
It’s very nice to talk to you, Dani. And I want to start by casting our minds back to what feels like the prehistoric years of the late 1990s because that’s when we first met. I was a PhD student at Harvard, you were already a well-established professor at Harvard. And what I remember is that you had just published a book called Has Globalization Gone Too Far? that made you quite the hero among a number of leftwing students, anti-free trade students, people who were protesting against these summits that were trying to create free trade areas. You ended up disappointing a lot of those students when you started your courses by saying there’ll be no heterodox economics in this class. This is all straightforward neoclassical economics.

But it also made you quite unique, I think, among elite economists in even raising the question whether globalisation and the general Washington Consensus maybe wasn’t as ideal as it was made out to be. So I thought I would just go back to that so that we get a sense of how much things have changed in terms of economic thinking and politics. Just tell us what the reaction was to that book when you very gently suggested there might be some problems with globalisation.

Dani Rodrik
Yes, well, you have a very good memory. I did find myself in a somewhat odd situation because it seemed fairly clear to me that we were set for a backlash. I mean, that book was published in 1997 and already in the mid-1990s, of course, you had people like Pat Buchanan, Ross Perot in the US sort of waving the flag of economic nationalism. You had a kind of a revival of Jean-Marie Le Pen, sort of lots of protests and labour unrest in France. You had a sort of a backlash to market liberalisation in the newly democratic countries in eastern Europe. And I also had in the back of my mind, of course, the historical experience of the backlash to the globalisation and the gold standard in the interwar period.

And then, of course, I knew all that sort of economic theory which is what I was trying to teach in that course, Martin, which was that opening up to trade, you know, increases efficiency but also creates a lot of redistribution and so that was going to be politically difficult. So it all seemed obvious to me, but the established narrative was so strong. I mean, I think people couldn’t imagine that this wasn’t all going to be good eventually for everybody or that there was any alternative. I do remember that the outfit that published the book, the Institute for International Economics, and I have to credit Fred Bergsten, the director of the institute then, for accepting to publish it, and despite some members of his board that didn’t want the book to publish. And there’s a little story that Fred basically gave then the manuscript to John Williamson, who was a member of the institute but also better known as the name father of the Washington Consensus. But John Williamson was a very reasonable guy who sort of read the thing and said, I don’t see anything problematic with it.

But still, I mean, when I circulated the manuscript among trade economists, it wasn’t unusual for me to get back, in fact, one of them reacted by saying, you know, all this is fine, but don’t you think you’re giving ammunition to the barbarians by, you know, raising the issue that globalisation might raise complications? That sort of made me really think hard, you know, why is it that the barbarians are only on the one side of this issue and that somehow people on the other side of the issue that were pushing for hyperglobalisation regardless of its consequences were somehow doing it for everybody’s benefit?

So I would say that it was more like, ended up being a curiosum for the economics profession. I think a lot of people ignored it and I was, you know, either still too orthodox for many people on the left or too radical for many orthodox economists. But that’s what I remember of it.

Martin Sandbu
One other area where you challenged the consensus was on capital controls, suggesting that the complete free movement of capital across borders may not always be as efficiency-enhancing as the standard theory and International Monetary Fund and other institutional prescriptions would have it. And that was also in the early 2000s, I think, after the Asian financial crisis in the late ’90s. But it makes me want to say that we’re all barbarians now. A lot of us have come around to thinking much more sceptically about globalisation.

And fast forward, we now have a US president, a returned US president, who seems hell-bent on actually tearing up the sort of globalised world we know. It’s hard to know what can happen in between recording this episode and it being published. But just last weekend, Trump slapped 25 per cent tariffs on Canada and Mexico. They quickly got suspended for 30 days. Who knows how that will hold up? He also put additional 10 per cent tariffs on China. If somebody had read your critiques 20, 30 years ago, they might have thought, well, this is the sort of thing that Dani Rodrik might agree with. You know, he was sceptical of globalisation. Here comes somebody who actually wants to undo globalisation. You are not, though, to put it mildly, endorsing Trump’s policy move. So tell us how you think about these tariffs.

Dani Rodrik
Well, I mean, not at all. I think the threatened tariffs are really senseless because they’re not going to achieve anything useful. You know, compared to, I think, most mainstream economists, I’m less doctrinaire, I would say on free trade. I do think that there are occasions when tariffs or trade restrictions have a role to play.

Martin Sandbu
Briefly, what are the situations where it’s sensible to think about tariffs?

Dani Rodrik
Yeah. I mean, you know, let me give you a couple of examples how trade policies have been deployed in support of, let’s say, the green transition. You know, in the EU, of course, we have these new tariffs that are coming online, the CBAM, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, to penalise imports from countries that are exporting steel, aluminium and dirty products. And that’s an example of using a policy to make the carbon pricing mechanism within the EU economically and politically viable. So the point is not that the tariffs will clean up the environment, it’s just that it makes green policies viable.

The US equivalent of that under Biden was some discriminatory provisions on local sourcing under the Inflation Reduction Act — these were the green subsidies — which I think again is a very useful climate transition policy. And from the standpoint of global trade rules, these discriminatory provisions on local sourcing violate our tenets of multilateralism and so forth. But I think it was a way to make politically palatable the domestic green transition program. So I think in that way, I don’t think we should be doctrinaire and accept that we live in a second-best world.

But more broadly, I think, for example, the history of east Asian countries, how they developed, and often they were sort of protected domestic industries. But it was never just tariffs that did the job. It was a concerted domestic project and national project of supporting new industries and new technologies and ramping up investment. And then tariffs played a useful role alongside them to provide for some temporary protection.

So what, you know, how the Trump tariffs are, is completely different because they’re not a shield to protect any kind of sensible, coherent domestic agenda of either social protection or structural change. They are the main act and they’re supposed to achieve on their own, you know, reduce the trade deficit, create jobs, reindustrialise, you know, maintain US technological hegemony, maintain the role of the dollar as a key reserve currency. All of that is supposed to be, you know, what tariffs will achieve and that’s just completely senseless.

Martin Sandbu
What do you make of the argument that you hear from some of the defenders of Trump’s policies, including some of his cabinet members, that we should see tariffs as a bargaining tool, as something you put in so that you can trade it off against other policy goals or just desirable policy change in other countries? I mean, he did suspend these tariffs with Canada and Mexico supposedly in return for some moves on securing the border.

Dani Rodrik
Yeah, I mean, again, it’s largely a distraction. I mean, I think if you look at what Canada and Mexico supposedly did to avert the tariffs, you know, they were largely policies that they were pursuing. I do think there is a kind of theatre behind this. The only shred of rationality in these threatened tariffs was that before they were supposed to come into effect, that Canada and Mexico would give Trump enough of a face-saving concession without really changing anything fundamental, that Trump would walk away claiming victory, saying, you know how these threats work. But it’s really all theatre and a distraction from the real problems and ultimately fundamentally undermines what these policies are supposed to do — to really reassert US power around the world. And instead, I think they’re just showing every country that the US is totally unreliable.

Martin Sandbu
So let’s move on to other countries, because senseless as they may be, they may be coming in. The ones on China are currently, I think, enforced. How should other countries respond then?

Dani Rodrik
Yeah, this is something that I feel really strongly about. It’s very strange to me that all economists and commentators who think that Trump’s tariffs are silly and dangerous seem to accept that other countries will retaliate, and that’s reasonable and rational for them to do. And that’s just not right. Trump is acting like a schoolyard bully, and the temptation is to say, well, the way to respond to a schoolyard bully is by responding in kind.

And there’s a certain logic in this tit-for-tat kind of policy. But these tariff wars aren’t like a true prisoner’s dilemma where tit-for-tat can eventually sustain a more reasonable co-operative outcome. And the reason for that is that countries that respond by putting up their own tariffs are essentially hurting themselves more than they would be hurting Trump or the US economy. And I think it’s just completely unreasonable to think that Trump will change his course simply because other countries are retaliating. If anything it’s just going to vindicate his idea that other countries are just taking advantage of the US.

And I think nothing would enrage Trump more than other countries basically saying, you know, you want to shoot yourself in the foot, go ahead. We’ll just mind our own economy. We can’t help it that what you’re doing hurts us, but we’re not going to magnify the insanity by responding in kind. We’ll just understand that the US is not a responsible and reliable trade partner. We’ll diversify our trade sources. And you were doing the most damage to yourself, President Trump, and to the US economy.

Now, it may be hard to respond in that way, but I think that is the right response. I should say that, you know, China has acted in a very measured kind of way because China indeed, now . . . The only country against which Trump has actually increased tariffs so far is China.

Martin Sandbu
So far, yes.

Dani Rodrik
And they’ve been very, very measured in their response, basically saying, we’ll look at what the American companies are doing. We’ll take you to the World Trade Organization. But no sort of across-the-board tariffs or anything like that.

Martin Sandbu
You know, some selective tariffs and a probe into Google, I think. Isn’t there a case, though, for saying that if you’re dealing with such an unpredictable actor in the White House and somebody who has a clear, expressed long-standing aversion to globalisation and the global system of rules, then it’s worth considering trying to make oneself inured to what the US can throw at you by gradually, at least, starting to reduce trade relations? And you mentioned diversifying, finding other partners. But could it be a goal for the countries for whom that’s at all realistic to say, well, actually over time we should think about having fewer economic relations with the US so that we’re not vulnerable to these sudden changes?

Dani Rodrik
Yeah, I mean, I think that’s a perfectly valid inference. That’s in some sense what countries have realised since the pandemic, which is the whole discourse around supply chain resilience is really about ensuring that your key supplies and your economies are not threatened by trade stoppages. And of course, in that case it was a public health emergency and a generalised collapse in trade.

In this case, it’s just the US but I do think that countries have to take these risks into account. In many ways, you know, we have to realise that as important as international trade and investment are, what happens domestically, what happens to the bulk of your economy that is actually not traded, which are services where the bulk of your employment is created — that is, if not more important, as important to the health of your economy.

And I think all these trade wars and thinking about international trade regime and market access and exports are really distracting attention from the future of these economies, which are going to be determined much more actually by developments domestically and in services, many of which are not traded.

Martin Sandbu
I almost want to paraphrase you as saying, don’t worry, be happy. We will indeed talk more about industrial policy and domestic policy a little bit later in the podcast. But I want to stay with the global economy for a little bit. Because I want to think about the scenario where there is serious persistent trade conflict. So tariffs come in, retaliatory tariffs are put in, and maybe policies in other economic areas that affect international economic exchange — it could be tax policy, there’s already been noise about that, intellectual property rights. Do you think that the world economy will, in fact, fragment? And if so, what does fragmentation look like?

Dani Rodrik
Yeah, I think, you know, we have the example of what happened in the interwar period when a cycle of protectionism and retaliation resulted in a downward spiral in the volume of international trade. And even though that wasn’t the primary reason for the Great Depression, it certainly aggravated it. And so I think something like this could be really costly.

Now, I always thought that a certain degree of fragmentation was inevitable. But I thought that, you know, North America would be sort of like one of these regions where the US, Canada and Mexico would remain fairly integrated and Trump has taken an axe even to that idea. So I think we have a huge amount of uncertainty as to what direction the US will go under Trump. I think other countries and regions, yes, I mean, I think we will see a certain amount of fragmentation without necessarily a huge amount of cost. That is to say that the efficiency costs of having even semiconductors or even AI that has very strong scale economies being produced in three or four different regions of the world and competing with each other within their own segmented markets, I don’t think the economic costs of that are huge. So you can imagine the sort of an area around China, Asia, south-east Asia, Europe. God knows what will happen in the Americas. But you know, with a lot more trade and investment happening within these blocs without necessarily huge amount of costs to the world economy. So you’re basically just trading off a little bit of scale losses against increased reliability of supply. So that’s not the end of the world.

But I think the whole dynamic that’s what I’m really worried about is the retaliation dynamic that I think just begins to overshadow everything. Policy gets determined by what did Trump do today and how do I respond to it? And thus all the priorities get distorted. And then it becomes impossible to pursue reasonable economic policies. And that has, I think, potentially quite significant costs.

Martin Sandbu
I mean, that sounds like a call to having somewhat more long-term goals in mind, but I find this observation that you made really important about how the costs may not be all that great depending on how it’s handled. I mean, it seemed to me for a long time that the big question is really what is the optimal scale of the big industries? Is the optimal scale global supply chains or can you have fully optimal regional, continental supply chain? So if the answer is the latter, then presumably even if the disruption is costly, you can reorganise a lot of these supply chains at a regional level. So listening to you, it sounds like you still think that this regionalisation of the global economy is where we’re headed.

Dani Rodrik
We are. And I think that’s where the underlying politics is driving us. Last week we had a very important development with DeepSeek, which gave us perhaps of a glimpse of a future where in fact the cost of fragmentation might be less than we think. Up until DeepSeek, we thought that the scale benefits of AI were so huge that ultimately it’s just basically a race in that whoever reaches the greatest scale first can wipe up everybody. And the implications of that become very significant in terms of how the US, for example, would want to shut out China and so forth and how it would drive geopolitics.

But then comes DeepSeek and say, look, I can do all this stuff at a fraction of the cost and the scale. And what that suggests is that it might be actually possible to have different subsystems relatively segmented from each other, where you don’t have to necessarily worry that you’re going to be driven out by some other region, some other political system that’s able to undercut you by getting larger-scale. So I think as we move into this future of generative AI, I’m thinking about how we’re going to establish countervailing power. How are we going to regulate it?

The possibilities of having coexisting systems where different parts of the world are applying different regulatory models, or because their politics are different, democracy versus authoritarian, their approach is very different, that these can coexist without necessarily posing existential threats to each other. That’s a vision that I think we should embrace because the alternative vision of either subsuming everything on the one hand, is it going to be either the US or China, or we’re going to have a fragmented world where the economic costs are huge and we’re going back to the stone age. I think those are dystopias that don’t need to happen.

Martin Sandbu
We’re going to take a very quick break, but as soon as we’re back, I want to turn to industrial policy. It’s all the rage now, and it’s another policy area where Dani was ahead of the curve. From the Biden to the Trumpian version or perhaps a European version of industrial policy, what sort of approach should newly activist governments pursue?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Welcome back to The Economics Show and welcome back to Dani Rodrik, our guest today. I am Martin Sandbu. So, Dani, just before the break, we talked about how fragmentation of the global economy could lead to differentiated economic systems developing in the different global regions. And that brings us to the question of industrial policy or state interventionism in how growth proceeds.

For a long time, industrial policy was a dirty word in economics or among many economists, and you were one of the early people to argue that against the consensus, state interventionism could, it could have a place in promoting growth. The politics around industrial policy have become much more favourable. Joe Biden, Donald Trump’s predecessor, was all in on industrial policy. It’s all the talk in Europe. China has been doing it for a long time. What have been your arguments in favour of industrial policy?

Dani Rodrik
First, even though industrial policy became unpopular among technocrats and economists, I think the practice never really disappeared. I mean, I think in the US, of course, industrial policy in the form of defence procurement or you know, the activities of Darpa in promoting frontier technologies, these were all examples of industrial policy and were usually successful, of course, especially in the case of Darpa. And also, you know, at the local level in the US, sort of, you know, at the municipal and regional level, there was a lot of industrial policy where local political actors engaged with businesses to incentivise investments, increase employment and so forth.

And of course, east Asia industrial policy has always been there. It’s important to understand that the biggest gain we have had so far in the fight against climate change really has come through industrial policy. Because it’s industrial policy in China that is responsible for this dramatic reduction in the cost of renewables that we’ve experienced over the past decade. And that’s really, you know, sort of this industrial policy didn’t start in China. They actually started under Obama in the US and in the EU, but they sort of receded to the background in the advanced countries. But China went in these industrial policies in solar and wind and more recently in EVs. And the reduction in prices that we’ve seen there that now sort of, you know, make clean energy much more viable than the fossil fuels, that’s really due to Chinese industrial policies.

So that’s sort of as by way of background as to how industrial policies have been significant in shaping our economic landscape. And Biden, I think, to his credit, was very upfront that this was going to be part of his agenda. I think IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act, was Biden’s version of China’s green industrial policies. You know, I think the industrial policies with respect to semiconductors was largely driven by geopolitical considerations. And, you know, I’ve been arguing, you know, sort of, first that I think industrial policy is . . . It’s silly to . . . You know, it’s the country, governments always do it. And there’s always a good reason because industrial policy is what you do to change the structure of your economy.

And, you know, changing the structure of your economies doesn’t just happen through market forces. So it’s always a collaboration between the government and businesses and investors and innovators to generate the right signals, eliminate obstacles and so forth. And that sort of loosely industrial policy, it doesn’t always have to be subsidies. It’s just, you know, figuring out what businesses need — maybe it’s workforce training, maybe some kind of infrastructure, maybe some regulatory changes. But just talking to the business, understanding what their needs are and goading them, incentivising them to move into areas, whether it’s green industries or semiconductors, that’s really what governments always do. And I think it’s better to be explicit about it and be self-conscious and talk about it than do it surreptitiously.

I do think that the kind of industrial policy that we need as we move to the future is sort of changing. And if we sort of, for example, if you put this in the context of Biden’s industrial policies, Biden’s industrial policies really emphasise manufacturing a lot. And I think part of it was, you know, geopolitics and supply chain resilience. But it was also the argument that we want to, you know, rebuild the middle class. I think this is extremely important that one of the things that has poisoned our politics is the erosion of the middle class, increased economic anxiety, the disappearance of good jobs because of deindustrialisation, automation, trade shocks, globalisation and so forth.

But you just cannot recreate those good jobs in manufacturing any more. Unfortunately, that has not yet entered the consciousness of most policymakers, whether in the United States or in Europe. I think there’s a kind of manufacturing fetishism that still prevails in the way that we think about industrial policy. Of course, the name industrial already denotes manufacturing. But I do think we need new kinds of industrial policies that will be much more focused on services because that’s where the jobs are. That’s where we need to create more good jobs. So we need to think much more about these different types of industrial policies in services alongside the green industrial policies.

Martin Sandbu
You are a university professor so if I ask you to grade Joe Biden’s industrial policy, what grade would you give it? Both in terms of the economic result, how well they were working on their own terms, but also politically because it seems like it wasn’t enough, or maybe it was the wrong thing to actually win over some of those voters the Democratic party had lost to Donald Trump.

Dani Rodrik
So it’s a very good question as to why these policies did not resonate at the polls more. So I think the easiest answer is to say, well, look, you know, he needed more time. Four years isn’t enough. And it wasn’t in four years that you were going to reverse the kind of a backlash against the elites, including the Democratic elites that had, you know, pushed for hyperglobalisation and were viewed as responsible for the hollowing out of the middle class and disappearance of good jobs. So, you know, one perspective is to say that these policies needed more time.

Another one, I think, and that sort of I think is important is to say, look, if you wanted to rebuild the middle class and appeal to your working-class base, really, sort of reconnect the Democratic party with the working class and show that you’re creating new pathways to a middle class for your workers, you know, focusing on manufacturing wasn’t going to do it. I mean, the representative worker today is not a factory worker, is not an auto worker or a steel worker. It’s a very low-waged, low-paid care worker or somebody in a warehouse or a food services worker.

So these are very different types of jobs. And those just . . . you know, huge tens of billions of dollars of subsidies and investments in manufacturing was simply not going to really do much for the workers. In fact, you can look at the outcomes, you know, sort of when Biden took over, he started his term, the share of manufacturing workers in total nonfarm employment in the United States was 8.3 per cent, already significantly below 10. By the time he left, after all this boom in investment and so forth, you know, the share of manufacturing workers had fallen further to 8.1 per cent.

So you look at countries that the US was trying to emulate, like South Korea, for example, or even China — China has lost more manufacturing workers over the last 10, 15 years than exists in the United States as a whole. So if your objective is to show how you can create economic opportunity and create pathways to the middle class or the working class, this manufacturing focus, I think, was the wrong one.

Martin Sandbu
I mean, this frustration that you’ve described in detail is what Donald Trump has tapped into and in some sense promised to reverse. Should we see Donald Trump as at least some sort of a representation of industrial policy, or is that just the wrong way to think about him?

Dani Rodrik
Well, you know, I think it is the worst kind of industrial policy, if you will. Because as I were discussing earlier, it’s essentially . . . it’s just purely tariffs. In fact, it’s even, you know, threats of tariffs. So even if you’re only focusing on tariffs like old-style infant industry protection, you’re not going to do it across the board. It’s not clear why you want to put tariffs on imports of toys or oil or tomatoes. You know, these aren’t the industries you’re trying to grow because they’re strategic or they’re important. They’re going to create lots of jobs in the US. So it’s really not strategic at all.

So even if you look at sort of just the component of, you know, the trade policy, it just seems completely indiscriminate and therefore, you know, non-strategic, non-well-thought out. But the bigger issue, again, is that an industrial policy is not just tariffs. The bigger component is sort of engaging with sort of the people who are engaged in generating investment, innovation, employment and figuring out what needs to be done in particular sectors.

Now, that’s what [the] Chips [Act] was, that’s what IRA was. So I have argued that in the case of Chips, it was misdirected from the standpoint of good job creation on manufacturing. But still, the process was the right one. You sort of say, OK, I want to bring these advanced chip manufacturing facilities into the United States, into Arizona. You know, what do these companies need? What do I provide them? Yes, subsidies is it, but they may need other things, too.

And there’s nothing like this, with Trump, it’s just tariffs. He is, of course, completely trying to roll back the green subsidies under the IRA. Chips, he can’t do anything about because, you know, almost all the money was out the door before he came in, but he would have stopped those too. I mean, there’s this kind of this incredibly naive and ill-placed notion that you just by raising tariffs, that you can, you know, you can solve all your problems at once, that tariffs are this Swiss army knife that, you know, simultaneously reduce your trade deficit, create jobs, restore the middle class, put you at the forefront of innovation and so forth. And selective tariffs might have a role to play together with a whole bunch of (inaudible) a well-thought-out domestic investment strategy but they can’t do it on its own. So the short answer to your question is yes. I mean, this is a brand of industrial policy, but it’s a brand of industrial policy that we know just doesn’t work.

Martin Sandbu
And yet both Trump’s policies, although all the chaos, the policy chaos that he’s fomenting, and Joe Biden’s industrial policy, both have created a lot of angst in Europe. So I want to ask you what you make of the European efforts. There’s a lot of debate trying to decide exactly what to do. What should Europe be doing in terms of its domestic economic policy or regional economic policy?

Dani Rodrik
Yeah, I mean, you know, I think it doesn’t make sense for the Europeans to complain, for example, that some of the discriminatory provisions of the IRA when, you know, they’re putting CBAM tariffs on their own. So I think if the logic is the same, sort of you’re using occasionally trade policy to support what ultimately is a very good strategy, which is to produce a reasonable carbon price, incentivise investments in green renewables and green industries, which is good for everybody.

And so I thought the Europeans were being, you know, a little bit too doctrinaire when they were sort of criticising such policies. But again, I do think that, you know, many of these same issues exist for Europe as well. Now, many of the same blind spots exist in Europe as well. So if you look at European strategies and industrial policies about big firms, it’s about, you know, big exporters, it’s about digitalisation, it’s about green transition. Now the green transition and digitalisation obviously are important and those should be the objective.

But I don’t think we should delude ourselves that if we’re going to address economic anxieties and strengthen the middle class and allay the concerns of regions that were been left behind, that those strategies are adequate. Because I think you need to put the emphasis squarely on jobs. And those are going to be, again, mostly in services and they will require different types of instruments. And I think, so Europe very much needs a version of these sort of more of a kind of industrial policy for services in order to promote good jobs in the middle class, as the US does.

Martin Sandbu
Does this mean that leaders in Europe and perhaps elsewhere are spending a little bit too much time worrying about competing with other countries or being outcompeted with them and should just focus a bit more on cultivating their garden at home, as it were?

Dani Rodrik
I do think there is that. I mean, I think it’s natural to worry that, you know, that Europeans might be falling behind on innovation and fixing some of the problems that might be behind that I think is important. But one thing that we have learned from the experience of the US is that, you know, you can be, you know, top of the world in terms of innovation, or you can be much better at TFP growth than Europe.

But if that innovation isn’t, you know, disseminating through society, if you’re not creating, you know, good productive jobs for the vast majority of your workers, you know, you’re just driving, you know, deeper these cleavages and not only sort of, you know, have these adverse effects in terms of inequalities and the erosion of the middle class. But you have this political . . . the poisoning of politics and the political backlash that comes from that, which is even more dangerous.

Yes. So innovation, but less focus on innovation, and productivity. I was a little bit taken aback by how the notion of competitiveness came back again with, you know, Mario Draghi’s report and so forth, because, you know, I thought we had put to bed the idea that competitiveness was an objective, that, you know, the right objective is productivity and economic opportunity. And looking at these problems from the perspective of how well you’re competing with other nations, I think, is not very productive.

Martin Sandbu
Productivity rather than competitiveness — I think that’s a great place to finish. Just in this sort of big scheme of things, in terms of the survival of the US republic, how worried are you?

Dani Rodrik
Very. I mean, those risks are much bigger than what he’s doing on economic policy and tariffs. I mean, those, you know, we can survive. But what’s happening politically is very scary. Very scary.

Martin Sandbu
Well, fingers crossed.

Dani Rodrik
Yep.

Donald Trump has not wasted any time in his hurry to upend the global economic order. Last weekend, he imposed big tariffs on the US’s most important trading partners. He’s also passed sweeping orders to undo the industrial policy of his predecessor Joe Biden — a policy that itself was a break with the earlier economic policy consensus. [MUSIC PLAYING] Welcome to The Economics Show. I am Martin Sandbu, the FT’s European economics commentator, and I’m guest-hosting our economics podcast, while our regular host, Soumaya Keynes, is on maternity leave. To help wrap our heads around President Trump’s policy moves and discuss how the world should respond, I’m joined by Dani Rodrik, professor of economics at Harvard University. Dani, welcome to the show. Dani Rodrik
Nice to be with you, Martin. Martin Sandbu
It’s very nice to talk to you, Dani. And I want to start by casting our minds back to what feels like the prehistoric years of the late 1990s because that’s when we first met. I was a PhD student at Harvard, you were already a well-established professor at Harvard. And what I remember is that you had just published a book called Has Globalization Gone Too Far? that made you quite the hero among a number of leftwing students, anti-free trade students, people who were protesting against these summits that were trying to create free trade areas. You ended up disappointing a lot of those students when you started your courses by saying there’ll be no heterodox economics in this class. This is all straightforward neoclassical economics. But it also made you quite unique, I think, among elite economists in even raising the question whether globalisation and the general Washington Consensus maybe wasn’t as ideal as it was made out to be. So I thought I would just go back to that so that we get a sense of how much things have changed in terms of economic thinking and politics. Just tell us what the reaction was to that book when you very gently suggested there might be some problems with globalisation. Dani Rodrik
Yes, well, you have a very good memory. I did find myself in a somewhat odd situation because it seemed fairly clear to me that we were set for a backlash. I mean, that book was published in 1997 and already in the mid-1990s, of course, you had people like Pat Buchanan, Ross Perot in the US sort of waving the flag of economic nationalism. You had a kind of a revival of Jean-Marie Le Pen, sort of lots of protests and labour unrest in France. You had a sort of a backlash to market liberalisation in the newly democratic countries in eastern Europe. And I also had in the back of my mind, of course, the historical experience of the backlash to the globalisation and the gold standard in the interwar period. And then, of course, I knew all that sort of economic theory which is what I was trying to teach in that course, Martin, which was that opening up to trade, you know, increases efficiency but also creates a lot of redistribution and so that was going to be politically difficult. So it all seemed obvious to me, but the established narrative was so strong. I mean, I think people couldn’t imagine that this wasn’t all going to be good eventually for everybody or that there was any alternative. I do remember that the outfit that published the book, the Institute for International Economics, and I have to credit Fred Bergsten, the director of the institute then, for accepting to publish it, and despite some members of his board that didn’t want the book to publish. And there’s a little story that Fred basically gave then the manuscript to John Williamson, who was a member of the institute but also better known as the name father of the Washington Consensus. But John Williamson was a very reasonable guy who sort of read the thing and said, I don’t see anything problematic with it. But still, I mean, when I circulated the manuscript among trade economists, it wasn’t unusual for me to get back, in fact, one of them reacted by saying, you know, all this is fine, but don’t you think you’re giving ammunition to the barbarians by, you know, raising the issue that globalisation might raise complications? That sort of made me really think hard, you know, why is it that the barbarians are only on the one side of this issue and that somehow people on the other side of the issue that were pushing for hyperglobalisation regardless of its consequences were somehow doing it for everybody’s benefit?  So I would say that it was more like, ended up being a curiosum for the economics profession. I think a lot of people ignored it and I was, you know, either still too orthodox for many people on the left or too radical for many orthodox economists. But that’s what I remember of it. Martin Sandbu
One other area where you challenged the consensus was on capital controls, suggesting that the complete free movement of capital across borders may not always be as efficiency-enhancing as the standard theory and International Monetary Fund and other institutional prescriptions would have it. And that was also in the early 2000s, I think, after the Asian financial crisis in the late ’90s. But it makes me want to say that we’re all barbarians now. A lot of us have come around to thinking much more sceptically about globalisation. And fast forward, we now have a US president, a returned US president, who seems hell-bent on actually tearing up the sort of globalised world we know. It’s hard to know what can happen in between recording this episode and it being published. But just last weekend, Trump slapped 25 per cent tariffs on Canada and Mexico. They quickly got suspended for 30 days. Who knows how that will hold up? He also put additional 10 per cent tariffs on China. If somebody had read your critiques 20, 30 years ago, they might have thought, well, this is the sort of thing that Dani Rodrik might agree with. You know, he was sceptical of globalisation. Here comes somebody who actually wants to undo globalisation. You are not, though, to put it mildly, endorsing Trump’s policy move. So tell us how you think about these tariffs. Dani Rodrik
Well, I mean, not at all. I think the threatened tariffs are really senseless because they’re not going to achieve anything useful. You know, compared to, I think, most mainstream economists, I’m less doctrinaire, I would say on free trade. I do think that there are occasions when tariffs or trade restrictions have a role to play. Martin Sandbu
Briefly, what are the situations where it’s sensible to think about tariffs? Dani Rodrik
Yeah. I mean, you know, let me give you a couple of examples how trade policies have been deployed in support of, let’s say, the green transition. You know, in the EU, of course, we have these new tariffs that are coming online, the CBAM, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, to penalise imports from countries that are exporting steel, aluminium and dirty products. And that’s an example of using a policy to make the carbon pricing mechanism within the EU economically and politically viable. So the point is not that the tariffs will clean up the environment, it’s just that it makes green policies viable. The US equivalent of that under Biden was some discriminatory provisions on local sourcing under the Inflation Reduction Act — these were the green subsidies — which I think again is a very useful climate transition policy. And from the standpoint of global trade rules, these discriminatory provisions on local sourcing violate our tenets of multilateralism and so forth. But I think it was a way to make politically palatable the domestic green transition program. So I think in that way, I don’t think we should be doctrinaire and accept that we live in a second-best world. But more broadly, I think, for example, the history of east Asian countries, how they developed, and often they were sort of protected domestic industries. But it was never just tariffs that did the job. It was a concerted domestic project and national project of supporting new industries and new technologies and ramping up investment. And then tariffs played a useful role alongside them to provide for some temporary protection.  So what, you know, how the Trump tariffs are, is completely different because they’re not a shield to protect any kind of sensible, coherent domestic agenda of either social protection or structural change. They are the main act and they’re supposed to achieve on their own, you know, reduce the trade deficit, create jobs, reindustrialise, you know, maintain US technological hegemony, maintain the role of the dollar as a key reserve currency. All of that is supposed to be, you know, what tariffs will achieve and that’s just completely senseless. Martin Sandbu
What do you make of the argument that you hear from some of the defenders of Trump’s policies, including some of his cabinet members, that we should see tariffs as a bargaining tool, as something you put in so that you can trade it off against other policy goals or just desirable policy change in other countries? I mean, he did suspend these tariffs with Canada and Mexico supposedly in return for some moves on securing the border. Dani Rodrik
Yeah, I mean, again, it’s largely a distraction. I mean, I think if you look at what Canada and Mexico supposedly did to avert the tariffs, you know, they were largely policies that they were pursuing. I do think there is a kind of theatre behind this. The only shred of rationality in these threatened tariffs was that before they were supposed to come into effect, that Canada and Mexico would give Trump enough of a face-saving concession without really changing anything fundamental, that Trump would walk away claiming victory, saying, you know how these threats work. But it’s really all theatre and a distraction from the real problems and ultimately fundamentally undermines what these policies are supposed to do — to really reassert US power around the world. And instead, I think they’re just showing every country that the US is totally unreliable. Martin Sandbu
So let’s move on to other countries, because senseless as they may be, they may be coming in. The ones on China are currently, I think, enforced. How should other countries respond then? Dani Rodrik
Yeah, this is something that I feel really strongly about. It’s very strange to me that all economists and commentators who think that Trump’s tariffs are silly and dangerous seem to accept that other countries will retaliate, and that’s reasonable and rational for them to do. And that’s just not right. Trump is acting like a schoolyard bully, and the temptation is to say, well, the way to respond to a schoolyard bully is by responding in kind. And there’s a certain logic in this tit-for-tat kind of policy. But these tariff wars aren’t like a true prisoner’s dilemma where tit-for-tat can eventually sustain a more reasonable co-operative outcome. And the reason for that is that countries that respond by putting up their own tariffs are essentially hurting themselves more than they would be hurting Trump or the US economy. And I think it’s just completely unreasonable to think that Trump will change his course simply because other countries are retaliating. If anything it’s just going to vindicate his idea that other countries are just taking advantage of the US. And I think nothing would enrage Trump more than other countries basically saying, you know, you want to shoot yourself in the foot, go ahead. We’ll just mind our own economy. We can’t help it that what you’re doing hurts us, but we’re not going to magnify the insanity by responding in kind. We’ll just understand that the US is not a responsible and reliable trade partner. We’ll diversify our trade sources. And you were doing the most damage to yourself, President Trump, and to the US economy.  Now, it may be hard to respond in that way, but I think that is the right response. I should say that, you know, China has acted in a very measured kind of way because China indeed, now . . . The only country against which Trump has actually increased tariffs so far is China. Martin Sandbu
So far, yes. Dani Rodrik
And they’ve been very, very measured in their response, basically saying, we’ll look at what the American companies are doing. We’ll take you to the World Trade Organization. But no sort of across-the-board tariffs or anything like that. Martin Sandbu
You know, some selective tariffs and a probe into Google, I think. Isn’t there a case, though, for saying that if you’re dealing with such an unpredictable actor in the White House and somebody who has a clear, expressed long-standing aversion to globalisation and the global system of rules, then it’s worth considering trying to make oneself inured to what the US can throw at you by gradually, at least, starting to reduce trade relations? And you mentioned diversifying, finding other partners. But could it be a goal for the countries for whom that’s at all realistic to say, well, actually over time we should think about having fewer economic relations with the US so that we’re not vulnerable to these sudden changes? Dani Rodrik
Yeah, I mean, I think that’s a perfectly valid inference. That’s in some sense what countries have realised since the pandemic, which is the whole discourse around supply chain resilience is really about ensuring that your key supplies and your economies are not threatened by trade stoppages. And of course, in that case it was a public health emergency and a generalised collapse in trade. In this case, it’s just the US but I do think that countries have to take these risks into account. In many ways, you know, we have to realise that as important as international trade and investment are, what happens domestically, what happens to the bulk of your economy that is actually not traded, which are services where the bulk of your employment is created — that is, if not more important, as important to the health of your economy.  And I think all these trade wars and thinking about international trade regime and market access and exports are really distracting attention from the future of these economies, which are going to be determined much more actually by developments domestically and in services, many of which are not traded. Martin Sandbu
I almost want to paraphrase you as saying, don’t worry, be happy. We will indeed talk more about industrial policy and domestic policy a little bit later in the podcast. But I want to stay with the global economy for a little bit. Because I want to think about the scenario where there is serious persistent trade conflict. So tariffs come in, retaliatory tariffs are put in, and maybe policies in other economic areas that affect international economic exchange — it could be tax policy, there’s already been noise about that, intellectual property rights. Do you think that the world economy will, in fact, fragment? And if so, what does fragmentation look like? Dani Rodrik
Yeah, I think, you know, we have the example of what happened in the interwar period when a cycle of protectionism and retaliation resulted in a downward spiral in the volume of international trade. And even though that wasn’t the primary reason for the Great Depression, it certainly aggravated it. And so I think something like this could be really costly. Now, I always thought that a certain degree of fragmentation was inevitable. But I thought that, you know, North America would be sort of like one of these regions where the US, Canada and Mexico would remain fairly integrated and Trump has taken an axe even to that idea. So I think we have a huge amount of uncertainty as to what direction the US will go under Trump. I think other countries and regions, yes, I mean, I think we will see a certain amount of fragmentation without necessarily a huge amount of cost. That is to say that the efficiency costs of having even semiconductors or even AI that has very strong scale economies being produced in three or four different regions of the world and competing with each other within their own segmented markets, I don’t think the economic costs of that are huge. So you can imagine the sort of an area around China, Asia, south-east Asia, Europe. God knows what will happen in the Americas. But you know, with a lot more trade and investment happening within these blocs without necessarily huge amount of costs to the world economy. So you’re basically just trading off a little bit of scale losses against increased reliability of supply. So that’s not the end of the world.  But I think the whole dynamic that’s what I’m really worried about is the retaliation dynamic that I think just begins to overshadow everything. Policy gets determined by what did Trump do today and how do I respond to it? And thus all the priorities get distorted. And then it becomes impossible to pursue reasonable economic policies. And that has, I think, potentially quite significant costs. Martin Sandbu
I mean, that sounds like a call to having somewhat more long-term goals in mind, but I find this observation that you made really important about how the costs may not be all that great depending on how it’s handled. I mean, it seemed to me for a long time that the big question is really what is the optimal scale of the big industries? Is the optimal scale global supply chains or can you have fully optimal regional, continental supply chain? So if the answer is the latter, then presumably even if the disruption is costly, you can reorganise a lot of these supply chains at a regional level. So listening to you, it sounds like you still think that this regionalisation of the global economy is where we’re headed. Dani Rodrik
We are. And I think that’s where the underlying politics is driving us. Last week we had a very important development with DeepSeek, which gave us perhaps of a glimpse of a future where in fact the cost of fragmentation might be less than we think. Up until DeepSeek, we thought that the scale benefits of AI were so huge that ultimately it’s just basically a race in that whoever reaches the greatest scale first can wipe up everybody. And the implications of that become very significant in terms of how the US, for example, would want to shut out China and so forth and how it would drive geopolitics. But then comes DeepSeek and say, look, I can do all this stuff at a fraction of the cost and the scale. And what that suggests is that it might be actually possible to have different subsystems relatively segmented from each other, where you don’t have to necessarily worry that you’re going to be driven out by some other region, some other political system that’s able to undercut you by getting larger-scale. So I think as we move into this future of generative AI, I’m thinking about how we’re going to establish countervailing power. How are we going to regulate it? The possibilities of having coexisting systems where different parts of the world are applying different regulatory models, or because their politics are different, democracy versus authoritarian, their approach is very different, that these can coexist without necessarily posing existential threats to each other. That’s a vision that I think we should embrace because the alternative vision of either subsuming everything on the one hand, is it going to be either the US or China, or we’re going to have a fragmented world where the economic costs are huge and we’re going back to the stone age. I think those are dystopias that don’t need to happen. Martin Sandbu
We’re going to take a very quick break, but as soon as we’re back, I want to turn to industrial policy. It’s all the rage now, and it’s another policy area where Dani was ahead of the curve. From the Biden to the Trumpian version or perhaps a European version of industrial policy, what sort of approach should newly activist governments pursue? [MUSIC PLAYING] Welcome back to The Economics Show and welcome back to Dani Rodrik, our guest today. I am Martin Sandbu. So, Dani, just before the break, we talked about how fragmentation of the global economy could lead to differentiated economic systems developing in the different global regions. And that brings us to the question of industrial policy or state interventionism in how growth proceeds. For a long time, industrial policy was a dirty word in economics or among many economists, and you were one of the early people to argue that against the consensus, state interventionism could, it could have a place in promoting growth. The politics around industrial policy have become much more favourable. Joe Biden, Donald Trump’s predecessor, was all in on industrial policy. It’s all the talk in Europe. China has been doing it for a long time. What have been your arguments in favour of industrial policy? Dani Rodrik
First, even though industrial policy became unpopular among technocrats and economists, I think the practice never really disappeared. I mean, I think in the US, of course, industrial policy in the form of defence procurement or you know, the activities of Darpa in promoting frontier technologies, these were all examples of industrial policy and were usually successful, of course, especially in the case of Darpa. And also, you know, at the local level in the US, sort of, you know, at the municipal and regional level, there was a lot of industrial policy where local political actors engaged with businesses to incentivise investments, increase employment and so forth. And of course, east Asia industrial policy has always been there. It’s important to understand that the biggest gain we have had so far in the fight against climate change really has come through industrial policy. Because it’s industrial policy in China that is responsible for this dramatic reduction in the cost of renewables that we’ve experienced over the past decade. And that’s really, you know, sort of this industrial policy didn’t start in China. They actually started under Obama in the US and in the EU, but they sort of receded to the background in the advanced countries. But China went in these industrial policies in solar and wind and more recently in EVs. And the reduction in prices that we’ve seen there that now sort of, you know, make clean energy much more viable than the fossil fuels, that’s really due to Chinese industrial policies. So that’s sort of as by way of background as to how industrial policies have been significant in shaping our economic landscape. And Biden, I think, to his credit, was very upfront that this was going to be part of his agenda. I think IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act, was Biden’s version of China’s green industrial policies. You know, I think the industrial policies with respect to semiconductors was largely driven by geopolitical considerations. And, you know, I’ve been arguing, you know, sort of, first that I think industrial policy is . . . It’s silly to . . . You know, it’s the country, governments always do it. And there’s always a good reason because industrial policy is what you do to change the structure of your economy. And, you know, changing the structure of your economies doesn’t just happen through market forces. So it’s always a collaboration between the government and businesses and investors and innovators to generate the right signals, eliminate obstacles and so forth. And that sort of loosely industrial policy, it doesn’t always have to be subsidies. It’s just, you know, figuring out what businesses need — maybe it’s workforce training, maybe some kind of infrastructure, maybe some regulatory changes. But just talking to the business, understanding what their needs are and goading them, incentivising them to move into areas, whether it’s green industries or semiconductors, that’s really what governments always do. And I think it’s better to be explicit about it and be self-conscious and talk about it than do it surreptitiously.  I do think that the kind of industrial policy that we need as we move to the future is sort of changing. And if we sort of, for example, if you put this in the context of Biden’s industrial policies, Biden’s industrial policies really emphasise manufacturing a lot. And I think part of it was, you know, geopolitics and supply chain resilience. But it was also the argument that we want to, you know, rebuild the middle class. I think this is extremely important that one of the things that has poisoned our politics is the erosion of the middle class, increased economic anxiety, the disappearance of good jobs because of deindustrialisation, automation, trade shocks, globalisation and so forth. But you just cannot recreate those good jobs in manufacturing any more. Unfortunately, that has not yet entered the consciousness of most policymakers, whether in the United States or in Europe. I think there’s a kind of manufacturing fetishism that still prevails in the way that we think about industrial policy. Of course, the name industrial already denotes manufacturing. But I do think we need new kinds of industrial policies that will be much more focused on services because that’s where the jobs are. That’s where we need to create more good jobs. So we need to think much more about these different types of industrial policies in services alongside the green industrial policies. Martin Sandbu
You are a university professor so if I ask you to grade Joe Biden’s industrial policy, what grade would you give it? Both in terms of the economic result, how well they were working on their own terms, but also politically because it seems like it wasn’t enough, or maybe it was the wrong thing to actually win over some of those voters the Democratic party had lost to Donald Trump. Dani Rodrik
So it’s a very good question as to why these policies did not resonate at the polls more. So I think the easiest answer is to say, well, look, you know, he needed more time. Four years isn’t enough. And it wasn’t in four years that you were going to reverse the kind of a backlash against the elites, including the Democratic elites that had, you know, pushed for hyperglobalisation and were viewed as responsible for the hollowing out of the middle class and disappearance of good jobs. So, you know, one perspective is to say that these policies needed more time. Another one, I think, and that sort of I think is important is to say, look, if you wanted to rebuild the middle class and appeal to your working-class base, really, sort of reconnect the Democratic party with the working class and show that you’re creating new pathways to a middle class for your workers, you know, focusing on manufacturing wasn’t going to do it. I mean, the representative worker today is not a factory worker, is not an auto worker or a steel worker. It’s a very low-waged, low-paid care worker or somebody in a warehouse or a food services worker. So these are very different types of jobs. And those just . . . you know, huge tens of billions of dollars of subsidies and investments in manufacturing was simply not going to really do much for the workers. In fact, you can look at the outcomes, you know, sort of when Biden took over, he started his term, the share of manufacturing workers in total nonfarm employment in the United States was 8.3 per cent, already significantly below 10. By the time he left, after all this boom in investment and so forth, you know, the share of manufacturing workers had fallen further to 8.1 per cent. So you look at countries that the US was trying to emulate, like South Korea, for example, or even China — China has lost more manufacturing workers over the last 10, 15 years than exists in the United States as a whole. So if your objective is to show how you can create economic opportunity and create pathways to the middle class or the working class, this manufacturing focus, I think, was the wrong one. Martin Sandbu
I mean, this frustration that you’ve described in detail is what Donald Trump has tapped into and in some sense promised to reverse. Should we see Donald Trump as at least some sort of a representation of industrial policy, or is that just the wrong way to think about him? Dani Rodrik
Well, you know, I think it is the worst kind of industrial policy, if you will. Because as I were discussing earlier, it’s essentially . . . it’s just purely tariffs. In fact, it’s even, you know, threats of tariffs. So even if you’re only focusing on tariffs like old-style infant industry protection, you’re not going to do it across the board. It’s not clear why you want to put tariffs on imports of toys or oil or tomatoes. You know, these aren’t the industries you’re trying to grow because they’re strategic or they’re important. They’re going to create lots of jobs in the US. So it’s really not strategic at all. So even if you look at sort of just the component of, you know, the trade policy, it just seems completely indiscriminate and therefore, you know, non-strategic, non-well-thought out. But the bigger issue, again, is that an industrial policy is not just tariffs. The bigger component is sort of engaging with sort of the people who are engaged in generating investment, innovation, employment and figuring out what needs to be done in particular sectors. Now, that’s what [the] Chips [Act] was, that’s what IRA was. So I have argued that in the case of Chips, it was misdirected from the standpoint of good job creation on manufacturing. But still, the process was the right one. You sort of say, OK, I want to bring these advanced chip manufacturing facilities into the United States, into Arizona. You know, what do these companies need? What do I provide them? Yes, subsidies is it, but they may need other things, too.  And there’s nothing like this, with Trump, it’s just tariffs. He is, of course, completely trying to roll back the green subsidies under the IRA. Chips, he can’t do anything about because, you know, almost all the money was out the door before he came in, but he would have stopped those too. I mean, there’s this kind of this incredibly naive and ill-placed notion that you just by raising tariffs, that you can, you know, you can solve all your problems at once, that tariffs are this Swiss army knife that, you know, simultaneously reduce your trade deficit, create jobs, restore the middle class, put you at the forefront of innovation and so forth. And selective tariffs might have a role to play together with a whole bunch of (inaudible) a well-thought-out domestic investment strategy but they can’t do it on its own. So the short answer to your question is yes. I mean, this is a brand of industrial policy, but it’s a brand of industrial policy that we know just doesn’t work. Martin Sandbu
And yet both Trump’s policies, although all the chaos, the policy chaos that he’s fomenting, and Joe Biden’s industrial policy, both have created a lot of angst in Europe. So I want to ask you what you make of the European efforts. There’s a lot of debate trying to decide exactly what to do. What should Europe be doing in terms of its domestic economic policy or regional economic policy? Dani Rodrik
Yeah, I mean, you know, I think it doesn’t make sense for the Europeans to complain, for example, that some of the discriminatory provisions of the IRA when, you know, they’re putting CBAM tariffs on their own. So I think if the logic is the same, sort of you’re using occasionally trade policy to support what ultimately is a very good strategy, which is to produce a reasonable carbon price, incentivise investments in green renewables and green industries, which is good for everybody. And so I thought the Europeans were being, you know, a little bit too doctrinaire when they were sort of criticising such policies. But again, I do think that, you know, many of these same issues exist for Europe as well. Now, many of the same blind spots exist in Europe as well. So if you look at European strategies and industrial policies about big firms, it’s about, you know, big exporters, it’s about digitalisation, it’s about green transition. Now the green transition and digitalisation obviously are important and those should be the objective. But I don’t think we should delude ourselves that if we’re going to address economic anxieties and strengthen the middle class and allay the concerns of regions that were been left behind, that those strategies are adequate. Because I think you need to put the emphasis squarely on jobs. And those are going to be, again, mostly in services and they will require different types of instruments. And I think, so Europe very much needs a version of these sort of more of a kind of industrial policy for services in order to promote good jobs in the middle class, as the US does. Martin Sandbu
Does this mean that leaders in Europe and perhaps elsewhere are spending a little bit too much time worrying about competing with other countries or being outcompeted with them and should just focus a bit more on cultivating their garden at home, as it were? Dani Rodrik
I do think there is that. I mean, I think it’s natural to worry that, you know, that Europeans might be falling behind on innovation and fixing some of the problems that might be behind that I think is important. But one thing that we have learned from the experience of the US is that, you know, you can be, you know, top of the world in terms of innovation, or you can be much better at TFP growth than Europe. But if that innovation isn’t, you know, disseminating through society, if you’re not creating, you know, good productive jobs for the vast majority of your workers, you know, you’re just driving, you know, deeper these cleavages and not only sort of, you know, have these adverse effects in terms of inequalities and the erosion of the middle class. But you have this political . . . the poisoning of politics and the political backlash that comes from that, which is even more dangerous. Yes. So innovation, but less focus on innovation, and productivity. I was a little bit taken aback by how the notion of competitiveness came back again with, you know, Mario Draghi’s report and so forth, because, you know, I thought we had put to bed the idea that competitiveness was an objective, that, you know, the right objective is productivity and economic opportunity. And looking at these problems from the perspective of how well you’re competing with other nations, I think, is not very productive. Martin Sandbu
Productivity rather than competitiveness — I think that’s a great place to finish. Just in this sort of big scheme of things, in terms of the survival of the US republic, how worried are you? Dani Rodrik
Very. I mean, those risks are much bigger than what he’s doing on economic policy and tariffs. I mean, those, you know, we can survive. But what’s happening politically is very scary. Very scary. Martin Sandbu
Well, fingers crossed. Dani Rodrik
Yep. Martin Sandbu
Dani Rodrik, thanks for joining The Economics Show. It’s been a pleasure speaking to you again. Dani Rodrik

That’s all for this week. You’ve been listening to The Economics Show with me, Martin Sandbu. This episode was produced by Laurence Knight and Edith Rousselot. With original music from Breen Turner. Our executive producer is Manuela Saragosa. The broadcast engineers are Andrew Georgiades and Rod Fitzgerald. Cheryl Brumley is the FT’s global head of audio. I’m Martin Sandbu. Thanks for listening.",2025-02-07,This is an audio transcript of The Economics Show podcast episode,"In a recent podcast episode of The Economics Show, Martin Sandbu discusses Donald Trump's economic policies with Dani Rodrik, a Harvard economics professor. Trump has implemented significant tariffs on key trading partners, aiming to reshape global trade and reverse the policies of his predecessor, Joe Biden. Rodrik recalls the backlash against globalization from the 1990s and critiques Trump's tariffs as ineffective, arguing they lack a coherent domestic agenda. While he acknowledges that tariffs can be useful in limited circumstances, like supporting green technologies, he believes Trump's approach is poorly executed and overly simplistic.

Rodrik expresses concern about retaliatory tariff wars, suggesting that countries should refrain from engaging in tit-for-tat actions which could harm their own economies. Instead, countries should focus on strengthening their own domestic economies and diversifying trade partners without escalating conflicts. He also discusses the inevitability of some economic fragmentation due to rising geopolitical tensions, but indicates that this might not pose significant costs.

Regarding industrial policy, Rodrik argues there is a need for government intervention to guide economic growth, especially in transitioning to green industries. However, he warns against focusing too much on manufacturing jobs, which are declining, and urges a shift towards creating good jobs in the service sector. He critically assesses Biden's industrial strategies, suggesting they could benefit from a broader focus beyond manufacturing. Ultimately, Rodrik highlights the importance of addressing economic inequality and fostering inclusive growth to maintain political stability."

Michela Tindera
Naming your company can be a tricky proposition. Do you want to project strength or power or reliability? The FT’s US managing editor, Brooke Masters, says that back in the 1970s, a guy named Jack Bogle was facing this exact problem. He was trying to figure out what to name his mutual fund company, and eventually he decided to go with a nautical theme. Specifically, he named his firm after a British battleship from the Napoleonic wars.

Brooke Masters
Vanguard was Horatio Nelson’s flagship during the Battle of the Nile at the very end of the 18th century, and this is a very crucial battle in the Napoleonic wars, where the British Navy destroys the French Navy, at least temporarily, by using new tactics.

Michela Tindera
And just like that famous ship, Vanguard turned the tides — not of war, but of stock picking.

Brooke Masters
Vanguard fundamentally reshaped retail investing. The firm used new tactics that their competitors had never really encountered before — a little bit like Vanguard, the ship, during the Battle of the Nile.

Michela Tindera
Vanguard’s strategy forced their rivals in asset management to adapt. And ever since then . . . 

Brooke Masters
It’s been cruising, just to put it bluntly. Vanguard is now the second-largest asset manager in the world. It runs the largest mutual fund in the world. This month, it also became the manager of the world’s largest exchange-traded fund, which is the hot new product. It’s basically enormously successful.

Michela Tindera
But recently, this massive ship brought aboard a new captain, and notably, he’s an outsider, poached from a competitor, which is a first in Vanguard’s history.

Brooke Masters
Vanguard has been steaming ahead, but now it has a new CEO who has ambitions to do the same thing to different parts of the financial services industry. So it’s, you know, it’s looking for new worlds to conquer.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Michela Tindera
Now, these new worlds that Brooke is talking about are other pockets of the financial services industry. And the thing is . . . 

Brooke Masters
If Vanguard is as successful in these new areas as it has been in the past, it could fundamentally disrupt financial services. I mean, they are basically an iceberg for the rest of the industry. And if they don’t succeed at what they’re doing, it could cause chaos for the rest of the industry. 

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Michela Tindera
I’m Michela Tindera from the Financial Times. Today, on Behind the Money, Vanguard became one of the largest money managers in the world by following a philosophy that’s grounded the firm for decades. Now there’s plans to tackle some other areas of financial services, too. And a new CEO — an outsider — is tasked with leading the charge. But do they have to move beyond their old founder’s mantra in order to achieve their goals?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Brooke, welcome to the show. It’s great to have you here.

Brooke Masters
Thanks for having me.

Michela Tindera
So this whole disruption that Vanguard achieved in asset management, it really begins with the firm’s founder, right, Jack Bogle. Tell me more about him.

Brooke Masters
He was a longtime investor, and he became obsessed with the idea of low cost — of finding ways to make it more affordable, particularly for small investors who can’t buy their way to cheaper fees, making it more affordable for them to invest in the markets.

Michela Tindera
Key point here — and you’re gonna hear this a lot going forward — Jack Bogle was all about keeping Vanguard’s costs low, low, low for their customers. I asked Brooke what kind of a name she might give this strategy.

Brooke Masters
I think you could think of it as cheap and cheerful.

Michela Tindera
So early on inside Vanguard, Bogle pulls off this cheap and cheerful strategy in two important ways. The first has to do with how the firm would invest clients’ money. At the time, the dominant style of investing was something called active management. That’s where stockpicking experts and researchers are pulling together baskets of securities that they think will perform well. And then charging you — the customer — higher fees to make all that happen. Bogle thought this was essentially nonsense.

Jack Bogle voice clip
Yeah, the fees in the mutual fund industry, I’m sorry to say, are generally pretty outrageous. I think the industry has got to adjust to a different era. The fees are too high and that’s all there is to that.

Michela Tindera
Bogle had a different plan.

Brooke Masters
He was a pioneer and a very important one of the idea of really cheap equity investing. The best way to do it is to not pay for experts. You just map what the markets do, it’s called index investing.

Michela Tindera
Index investing or passive investing pretty much just mimics a certain stock index like the S&P 500. That’s the 500 biggest publicly traded US companies by market cap. And so if the S&P 500 is up, you’re up.

Brooke Masters
It’s much, much cheaper because you don’t need anybody to do any research. You don’t have to think about what you’re buying. And so his whole view was like, how can we make it as cheap as possible for people to invest in the markets for the long term? If you don’t have access to some schnazzy money person and you don’t need white glove service, it’s great. It’s absolutely a fundamental way that a small investor can profit from the markets over the long term.

Michela Tindera
So there’s the passive investing piece of this. But remember I said there’s something else that Bogle does too — he also set up Vanguard with a very unique ownership structure.

Brooke Masters
Vanguard is pretty much the only big company where the ownership of the fund management company is actually the funds themselves, which sounds . . . it’s very circular, but basically what that means is there aren’t any outside shareholders. Like, BlackRock has outside shareholders. So if it has leftover money, it’s supposed to pay dividends or buy back shares and make life happy for its shareholders.

Michela Tindera
Like most companies that you think of.

Brooke Masters
And that’s just . . . That’s how modern stock investing works. Vanguard has this weird structure where there are no outside shareholders, there’s no founding family, there’s no partnership. Whatever money is left is supposed to go back to the people who also invest in the funds.

Michela Tindera
So what that means is any leftover money that would typically go to shareholders, instead, at Vanguard turns into even more cuts, pushing the firm’s fees lower and lower. Now these efforts — the passive investing and the ownership structure sent the industry spiralling.

Brooke Masters
It just squeezed the heck out of the industry. It forced everyone to think of ways to bring their costs down, and it really completely cut a swath through particularly active investment funds, but just the industry more broadly that it absolutely said like, you, investor, don’t have to be paying these fees. You can pay less and you can walk home with more money.

Michela Tindera
Yeah, I mean, the appeal is just kind of undeniable.

Brooke Masters
Absolutely. And it also . . . this is a period when Americans in particular are shifting to what are called 401k plans, which are retirement plans. So they are investing their long-term, their 30-year money, their 50-year money into the stock market and into the bond market. And so you really could see over time how much it matters. Like, over two or three years, it’s, you know, 2 per cent versus 3 per cent or 3 per cent versus 5 per cent. But you compound that, and we’re talking millions and millions of dollars and staggeringly better results.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Michela Tindera
Now, Jack Bogle retired from Vanguard way back in the 1990s. But his cheap and cheerful strategy kept the firm sailing with the wind at its back for decades. Lately, though, the competitive landscape has changed.

Brooke Masters
I think the thing that’s happened in recent years is many, many other providers are also doing index funds and also doing cheap. So fees have come down dramatically, both for active and passive funds. And so Vanguard — while it remains the cheapest, pretty much — has found itself, you know, it’s less unusual. The other thing that’s happened is other companies, particularly upstarts and fintechs, have been offering new ways to trade and, you know, the whole meme stock phenomenon where lots of retail investors got excited about being able to trade shares. So there is another way for small investors to get involved in the market now.

Michela Tindera
What Brooke’s talking about here are companies like Robinhood and Betterment. They offer trading without the big fees. They have investment advice and they also have these sleek apps.

Brooke Masters
As a little investor, you buy derivatives, you buy wacky stuff and you can do it on your phone. Vanguard, meanwhile — with his little cheap and cheerful theory of the universe — so they didn’t offer all that, all the bells and whistles. They weren’t gonna give you confetti when you made a trade or any of that stuff. And so it’s not that they ever shrunk, they continue to grow dramatically, but they were losing out on some investors who wanted something different.

Michela Tindera
Now let me zero in here on the last thing that Brooke said — it’s important. Vanguard’s still cruising comfortably, being cheap and cheerful, but they are missing out on a whole new crop of investors, particularly young ones. And so Vanguard in recent years decided to lean into three new offerings to expand their reach.

Brooke Masters
About five years ago, they decided to make a push into active fixed income. That puts them into conflict with active bond managers who pick bonds rather than just following an index. They are also making a push into high-yield savings accounts, which puts them on a collision course with banks and wealth managers.

Michela Tindera
But Vanguard is pushing in another direction, too. And this could be the effort that shakes things up the most.

Brooke Masters
The third thing, which is perhaps the most revolutionary and the one that really is gonna cause all kinds of ructions, is they’re offering financial advice, with the idea . . . advice is how much of your money should you put in stocks versus bonds? You know, when should you shift the balance because you’re getting old and you can’t afford to lose things? These are really confusing issues, and lots of people want advice.

Advice, traditionally, has been something that only rich people get because it’s expensive to provide advice, Like, you know, some guy sitting and looking at my finances telling me, look, Brooke, you want a house in five years, so, therefore, you should do this with your money. That takes time and energy and they charge for it. And so what Vanguard’s trying to do is use, particularly computers, but also just their huge size, as always, to offer lower-cost advice to people who probably couldn’t afford to buy any advice elsewhere.

Michela Tindera
Vanguard wants to offer each of these things — the bond investing, the cash accounts, the investment advice for, you guessed it, cheap, cheap, cheap. That is their mantra, after all. And here’s the thing. They’ve got a new CEO who’s in charge of making those a reality. His name is Salim Ramji. I asked Brooke about him. What else should we know about him? You’ve interviewed him a couple of times now, right?

Brooke Masters
I’ve actually . . . I know him pretty well because he was a McKinsey consultant. And then he went to BlackRock. At BlackRock, he ran their index funds. So he is an expert in this sort of passive investing stuff. So what’s interesting is he is the first external CEO Vanguard has ever had. That’s a bit of a shocker, you know. And so there’s an interesting question, like where will he take them? They obviously felt they didn’t have what they needed internally. And so obviously they’re trying to do something different. You don’t bring in an outsider if everything’s perfect.

Michela Tindera
Yeah, that’s a big deal considering Vanguard’s never hired a CEO directly from an outside firm before. So then what’s Ramji’s plan to tackle this stuff?

Brooke Masters
I mean, Vanguard had already — under the previous CEO — started thinking about going into advice, it had actually done quite a bit. But he is out there spearheading it, telling the story to the world, pushing it. He brought in another outsider, interestingly, to run the financial advice stuff. Somebody who had been at Fidelity, which is one of Vanguard’s big, big rivals and way, way ahead on advice. They do a lot of advice. It’s kind of like, I mean, they were definitely working on it quietly. They’re now seriously full speed ahead, and they’ve got a guy who’s out there cheerleading but also leading it. I mean, he’s the guy who says, damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead.

Michela Tindera
OK, so Ramji’s pushing into these new areas — investment advice, but also the bonds and the cash accounts. So what challenges do you see ahead?

Brooke Masters
He’s an outsider. You know, there could easily be organ rejection. You know, Vanguard is proud of being different from everybody else. You know, they’re based in suburban Pennsylvania. They’re, you know, far from Wall Street. Lots and lots of people spend, if not their entire career, the vast bulk of their career at Vanguard. You know, if he is seen as pushing too far too fast or he’s seen as sort of too slick or not respectful enough of something that many of them have put their lives into. You know, he has to take the people with him. The people that they call crew — remember, going to Jack Bogle and his ship fascination — they’re called crew and the executives are called officers.

And so, you know, if they decide, you know, they could easily throw him overboard. Mutiny on the Vanguard. That’s the first big challenge, as he has to convince people that this is the right thing to do, and he’s the right person to lead it.

Michela Tindera
Yeah. So that’s the first thing. What, aside from that, is he gonna face?

Brooke Masters
The second huge challenge is much of what they want to do depends on having really good technology. Particularly the advice stuff, where the only way you can make advice affordable is through heavy use of AI and computers. And they have historically had terrible technology, like famously bad technology. Part of the cheap and cheerful was like, we don’t invest in this stuff and it was just dreadful.

Michela Tindera
Brooke, I’m curious, because here at the Financial Times, we have Vanguard as our retirement provider now. Actually, I started at the FT in 2022, and I thought that the platform, I thought was pretty snazzy, actually. But what’s your take on that?

Brooke Masters
I mean, I would say you’re lucky in that you arrived in the middle of a transformation. They started spending big money on technology about six years ago because they realised they had to do more. And they started spending 1bn a year back then, they now spend 3bn a year. And so they have been in the process of improving their technology. It wouldn’t surprise me that if you happen to hit the right pocket, that you got the good technology because they definitely are much better.

I have been using Vanguard for decades because my first 401k plan at my first employer was at Vanguard. And I will say it is radically different than it was when I started. I mean, one of my single most frustrating experiences with Vanguard was I had a 401k retirement plan from my old employer, which was at Vanguard, and I had a 401k retirement plan from the FT, which was also with Vanguard. And I wanted to combine them because if you put things together, they obviously, you cut your fees and it’s much easier to manage.

And so I called Vanguard and said like, can I just squash them together? And they said, well, yes you can. But the way you have to do that is you have to close your old account, we have to mail you the check, and then you have to mail it back to us in order to do it. And I was like, but you have my money. And they’re like, no, can’t do it any other way. And that was, I think three years ago, two and a half.

Michela Tindera
Wow.

Brooke Masters
I mean, that’s insane! Like I’m already depositing checks in my bank off of my phone, and Vanguard can’t combine two accounts? I mean, that’s outrageous.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Michela Tindera
OK, so the new CEO has some obstacles that he has to figure out. He’s an outsider. They’ve got to improve their tech. Now I gotta make at least one more nautical reference here. But how does Ramji navigate all this? Which way does he steer the ship?

Brooke Masters
Well, I think the first thing he’s done since arriving last summer, was to really be respectful of Vanguard’s traditions and talk a lot about Jack Bogle and how much he respects him. And in one sort of telling gesture, when he redecorated his office, he thought back to Vanguard, the ship. He asked them to find the painting of the ship that had once hung in a prominent place, and they pulled it out of a basement, and he’s now got it hanging behind his desk in his office.

Michela Tindera
Yeah, that’s a big gesture.

Brooke Masters
That’s a big gesture. Like, it’s like, I respect this and I understand your heritage. And so I think that’s a big start. And he has to continue to do that kind of thing. He also has to hope that the woman he brought in from Fidelity to run the advice arm is similarly able to change the way they do advice and lead this big push without alienating people. I mean, she pushed through big changes at Fidelity but also lasted less than two years. So she is definitely a change agent and how well that goes, who knows.

On the tech side, I think they have been investing. And the real issue for them on the tech side, I think, is assuming that if it is as they claim that their technology really is much better, they have a perception problem more than anything. Because any website, anywhere has days. I mean, you know, the FT periodically doesn’t work. But because they have this reputation, any time it wobbles even a little bit, everyone’s like, oh look, it’s them again. And so stuff that they would completely tolerate from Walmart, they’re like, oh my god, Vanguard’s terrible tech. So that’s gonna be a matter of just proving that they can handle busy trading days, that they’ll be there, that it all works. And I think that takes time.

Michela Tindera
So if Vanguard, you know, succeeds and does manage to push forward on these three areas they’re trying to work on, how does that impact the rest of the investment industry?

Brooke Masters
I think it could be really scary for . . . particularly for the people who are known as wealth managers, who are the ones who give advice. Some asset managers have wealth management arms and give advice like Fidelity. But lots of places like private banks and you know, independent financial advisers who, you know, you go to them in their little office and they do stuff. If Vanguard’s actually out there offering a good product for a good price and frankly, Vanguard has a tremendous brand. I mean, people may get annoyed at their technology, but everybody believes they are doing their best, and what they offer is cheap and it’s in your interest.

So basically, if you’re willing to take all computer advice, no human beings, they’ll give you an advice for one-fifth as much money. And if you have at least $10,000, which isn’t very much considering most Americans have retirement money, they’ll do it for basically a third of what the pay for wealth managers are doing. I mean, they are coming in and seriously undercutting the industry. And if people are comfortable with that and decide that they want that, that could really upend the business models of all of these companies.

Michela Tindera
So what happens if Vanguard fails in any of these areas? I mean, does it have much to lose?

Brooke Masters
I mean, I think what Vanguard would say is everything they invest is money they could have given back to their investors. So I think they can easily cancel things and stop. But that’s, I mean, that’s an admission of failure. And when you’re owned by your investors, you don’t want to be wasting their money. So I think it’s embarrassing. Or do I think it will undermine Vanguard’s success? Probably not.

Michela Tindera
So as you mentioned, you know, for several decades, talking about Vanguard, their strategy has been cheap and cheerful, do you see that changing in the future? Do we give it a new name or is it more of the same?

Brooke Masters
I think it’s still cheap for sure, but they are trying to use things like AI and behavioural economics to nudge people into doing all this stuff, rather than just laying their wares out and saying come if you want. They are actively trying to push you. Cheap and clever is what they would like to be. I’m not sure they’re gonna get there, but I think their hope is to someday be both cheap and clever.

Michela Tindera
OK, so Vanguard led the charge for so long and they’re taking aim at new areas of financial services. I mean, what’s the lesson here, just don’t get complacent?

Brooke Masters
I mean, the investment industry has been, you know, spent many years being fat and happy. They made a lot of money, they made some money for their customers because customers don’t know what they’re doing. Compare the profit margins in financial advice to the profit margins in, say, supermarkets, where people understand what they’re buying. Vanguard’s lesson is just because you’re selling a complicated product does not mean you can take an unfair share of the take. And what they have said is what people were used to paying, they don’t have to pay any more. And that’s a big change.

Michela Tindera
And that’ll kind of continue as they move into these other areas to . . . 

Brooke Masters
And they’re not the only ones. I mean, that’s the thing . . . I mean, Vanguard is big and famous and does this stuff but there are other cheaper alternatives. And I think that is pressing the advantage on that, that any part of the industry that has still got fabulous profit margins and is not having to compete for customers in the same way, should be on notice that you know, somebody is coming to get them.

Michela Tindera

Now there’s plans to tackle some other areas of financial services, too. And a new CEO — an outsider — is tasked with leading the charge. But do they have to move beyond their old founder’s mantra in order to achieve their goals? [MUSIC PLAYING] Brooke, welcome to the show. It’s great to have you here. Brooke Masters
Thanks for having me. Michela Tindera
So this whole disruption that Vanguard achieved in asset management, it really begins with the firm’s founder, right, Jack Bogle. Tell me more about him. Brooke Masters
He was a longtime investor, and he became obsessed with the idea of low cost — of finding ways to make it more affordable, particularly for small investors who can’t buy their way to cheaper fees, making it more affordable for them to invest in the markets. Michela Tindera
Key point here — and you’re gonna hear this a lot going forward — Jack Bogle was all about keeping Vanguard’s costs low, low, low for their customers. I asked Brooke what kind of a name she might give this strategy. Brooke Masters
I think you could think of it as cheap and cheerful. Michela Tindera
So early on inside Vanguard, Bogle pulls off this cheap and cheerful strategy in two important ways. The first has to do with how the firm would invest clients’ money. At the time, the dominant style of investing was something called active management. That’s where stockpicking experts and researchers are pulling together baskets of securities that they think will perform well. And then charging you — the customer — higher fees to make all that happen. Bogle thought this was essentially nonsense. Jack Bogle voice clip
Yeah, the fees in the mutual fund industry, I’m sorry to say, are generally pretty outrageous. I think the industry has got to adjust to a different era. The fees are too high and that’s all there is to that. Michela Tindera
Bogle had a different plan. Brooke Masters
He was a pioneer and a very important one of the idea of really cheap equity investing. The best way to do it is to not pay for experts. You just map what the markets do, it’s called index investing. Michela Tindera
Index investing or passive investing pretty much just mimics a certain stock index like the S&P 500. That’s the 500 biggest publicly traded US companies by market cap. And so if the S&P 500 is up, you’re up. Brooke Masters
It’s much, much cheaper because you don’t need anybody to do any research. You don’t have to think about what you’re buying. And so his whole view was like, how can we make it as cheap as possible for people to invest in the markets for the long term? If you don’t have access to some schnazzy money person and you don’t need white glove service, it’s great. It’s absolutely a fundamental way that a small investor can profit from the markets over the long term. Michela Tindera
So there’s the passive investing piece of this. But remember I said there’s something else that Bogle does too — he also set up Vanguard with a very unique ownership structure. Brooke Masters
Vanguard is pretty much the only big company where the ownership of the fund management company is actually the funds themselves, which sounds . . . it’s very circular, but basically what that means is there aren’t any outside shareholders. Like, BlackRock has outside shareholders. So if it has leftover money, it’s supposed to pay dividends or buy back shares and make life happy for its shareholders. Michela Tindera
Like most companies that you think of. Brooke Masters
And that’s just . . . That’s how modern stock investing works. Vanguard has this weird structure where there are no outside shareholders, there’s no founding family, there’s no partnership. Whatever money is left is supposed to go back to the people who also invest in the funds. Michela Tindera
So what that means is any leftover money that would typically go to shareholders, instead, at Vanguard turns into even more cuts, pushing the firm’s fees lower and lower. Now these efforts — the passive investing and the ownership structure sent the industry spiralling. Brooke Masters
It just squeezed the heck out of the industry. It forced everyone to think of ways to bring their costs down, and it really completely cut a swath through particularly active investment funds, but just the industry more broadly that it absolutely said like, you, investor, don’t have to be paying these fees. You can pay less and you can walk home with more money. Michela Tindera
Yeah, I mean, the appeal is just kind of undeniable. Brooke Masters
Absolutely. And it also . . . this is a period when Americans in particular are shifting to what are called 401k plans, which are retirement plans. So they are investing their long-term, their 30-year money, their 50-year money into the stock market and into the bond market. And so you really could see over time how much it matters. Like, over two or three years, it’s, you know, 2 per cent versus 3 per cent or 3 per cent versus 5 per cent. But you compound that, and we’re talking millions and millions of dollars and staggeringly better results. [MUSIC PLAYING] Michela Tindera
Now, Jack Bogle retired from Vanguard way back in the 1990s. But his cheap and cheerful strategy kept the firm sailing with the wind at its back for decades. Lately, though, the competitive landscape has changed. Brooke Masters
I think the thing that’s happened in recent years is many, many other providers are also doing index funds and also doing cheap. So fees have come down dramatically, both for active and passive funds. And so Vanguard — while it remains the cheapest, pretty much — has found itself, you know, it’s less unusual. The other thing that’s happened is other companies, particularly upstarts and fintechs, have been offering new ways to trade and, you know, the whole meme stock phenomenon where lots of retail investors got excited about being able to trade shares. So there is another way for small investors to get involved in the market now. Michela Tindera
What Brooke’s talking about here are companies like Robinhood and Betterment. They offer trading without the big fees. They have investment advice and they also have these sleek apps. Brooke Masters
As a little investor, you buy derivatives, you buy wacky stuff and you can do it on your phone. Vanguard, meanwhile — with his little cheap and cheerful theory of the universe — so they didn’t offer all that, all the bells and whistles. They weren’t gonna give you confetti when you made a trade or any of that stuff. And so it’s not that they ever shrunk, they continue to grow dramatically, but they were losing out on some investors who wanted something different. Michela Tindera
Now let me zero in here on the last thing that Brooke said — it’s important. Vanguard’s still cruising comfortably, being cheap and cheerful, but they are missing out on a whole new crop of investors, particularly young ones. And so Vanguard in recent years decided to lean into three new offerings to expand their reach. Brooke Masters
About five years ago, they decided to make a push into active fixed income. That puts them into conflict with active bond managers who pick bonds rather than just following an index. They are also making a push into high-yield savings accounts, which puts them on a collision course with banks and wealth managers. Michela Tindera
But Vanguard is pushing in another direction, too. And this could be the effort that shakes things up the most. Brooke Masters
The third thing, which is perhaps the most revolutionary and the one that really is gonna cause all kinds of ructions, is they’re offering financial advice, with the idea . . . advice is how much of your money should you put in stocks versus bonds? You know, when should you shift the balance because you’re getting old and you can’t afford to lose things? These are really confusing issues, and lots of people want advice. Advice, traditionally, has been something that only rich people get because it’s expensive to provide advice, Like, you know, some guy sitting and looking at my finances telling me, look, Brooke, you want a house in five years, so, therefore, you should do this with your money. That takes time and energy and they charge for it. And so what Vanguard’s trying to do is use, particularly computers, but also just their huge size, as always, to offer lower-cost advice to people who probably couldn’t afford to buy any advice elsewhere. Michela Tindera
Vanguard wants to offer each of these things — the bond investing, the cash accounts, the investment advice for, you guessed it, cheap, cheap, cheap. That is their mantra, after all. And here’s the thing. They’ve got a new CEO who’s in charge of making those a reality. His name is Salim Ramji. I asked Brooke about him. What else should we know about him? You’ve interviewed him a couple of times now, right? Brooke Masters
I’ve actually . . . I know him pretty well because he was a McKinsey consultant. And then he went to BlackRock. At BlackRock, he ran their index funds. So he is an expert in this sort of passive investing stuff. So what’s interesting is he is the first external CEO Vanguard has ever had. That’s a bit of a shocker, you know. And so there’s an interesting question, like where will he take them? They obviously felt they didn’t have what they needed internally. And so obviously they’re trying to do something different. You don’t bring in an outsider if everything’s perfect. Michela Tindera
Yeah, that’s a big deal considering Vanguard’s never hired a CEO directly from an outside firm before. So then what’s Ramji’s plan to tackle this stuff? Brooke Masters
I mean, Vanguard had already — under the previous CEO — started thinking about going into advice, it had actually done quite a bit. But he is out there spearheading it, telling the story to the world, pushing it. He brought in another outsider, interestingly, to run the financial advice stuff. Somebody who had been at Fidelity, which is one of Vanguard’s big, big rivals and way, way ahead on advice. They do a lot of advice. It’s kind of like, I mean, they were definitely working on it quietly. They’re now seriously full speed ahead, and they’ve got a guy who’s out there cheerleading but also leading it. I mean, he’s the guy who says, damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead. Michela Tindera
OK, so Ramji’s pushing into these new areas — investment advice, but also the bonds and the cash accounts. So what challenges do you see ahead? Brooke Masters
He’s an outsider. You know, there could easily be organ rejection. You know, Vanguard is proud of being different from everybody else. You know, they’re based in suburban Pennsylvania. They’re, you know, far from Wall Street. Lots and lots of people spend, if not their entire career, the vast bulk of their career at Vanguard. You know, if he is seen as pushing too far too fast or he’s seen as sort of too slick or not respectful enough of something that many of them have put their lives into. You know, he has to take the people with him. The people that they call crew — remember, going to Jack Bogle and his ship fascination — they’re called crew and the executives are called officers. And so, you know, if they decide, you know, they could easily throw him overboard. Mutiny on the Vanguard. That’s the first big challenge, as he has to convince people that this is the right thing to do, and he’s the right person to lead it. Michela Tindera
Yeah. So that’s the first thing. What, aside from that, is he gonna face? Brooke Masters
The second huge challenge is much of what they want to do depends on having really good technology. Particularly the advice stuff, where the only way you can make advice affordable is through heavy use of AI and computers. And they have historically had terrible technology, like famously bad technology. Part of the cheap and cheerful was like, we don’t invest in this stuff and it was just dreadful. Michela Tindera
Brooke, I’m curious, because here at the Financial Times, we have Vanguard as our retirement provider now. Actually, I started at the FT in 2022, and I thought that the platform, I thought was pretty snazzy, actually. But what’s your take on that? Brooke Masters
I mean, I would say you’re lucky in that you arrived in the middle of a transformation. They started spending big money on technology about six years ago because they realised they had to do more. And they started spending 1bn a year back then, they now spend 3bn a year. And so they have been in the process of improving their technology. It wouldn’t surprise me that if you happen to hit the right pocket, that you got the good technology because they definitely are much better. I have been using Vanguard for decades because my first 401k plan at my first employer was at Vanguard. And I will say it is radically different than it was when I started. I mean, one of my single most frustrating experiences with Vanguard was I had a 401k retirement plan from my old employer, which was at Vanguard, and I had a 401k retirement plan from the FT, which was also with Vanguard. And I wanted to combine them because if you put things together, they obviously, you cut your fees and it’s much easier to manage. And so I called Vanguard and said like, can I just squash them together? And they said, well, yes you can. But the way you have to do that is you have to close your old account, we have to mail you the check, and then you have to mail it back to us in order to do it. And I was like, but you have my money. And they’re like, no, can’t do it any other way. And that was, I think three years ago, two and a half. Michela Tindera
Wow. Brooke Masters
I mean, that’s insane! Like I’m already depositing checks in my bank off of my phone, and Vanguard can’t combine two accounts? I mean, that’s outrageous. [MUSIC PLAYING] Michela Tindera
OK, so the new CEO has some obstacles that he has to figure out. He’s an outsider. They’ve got to improve their tech. Now I gotta make at least one more nautical reference here. But how does Ramji navigate all this? Which way does he steer the ship? Brooke Masters
Well, I think the first thing he’s done since arriving last summer, was to really be respectful of Vanguard’s traditions and talk a lot about Jack Bogle and how much he respects him. And in one sort of telling gesture, when he redecorated his office, he thought back to Vanguard, the ship. He asked them to find the painting of the ship that had once hung in a prominent place, and they pulled it out of a basement, and he’s now got it hanging behind his desk in his office. Michela Tindera
Yeah, that’s a big gesture. Brooke Masters
That’s a big gesture. Like, it’s like, I respect this and I understand your heritage. And so I think that’s a big start. And he has to continue to do that kind of thing. He also has to hope that the woman he brought in from Fidelity to run the advice arm is similarly able to change the way they do advice and lead this big push without alienating people. I mean, she pushed through big changes at Fidelity but also lasted less than two years. So she is definitely a change agent and how well that goes, who knows. On the tech side, I think they have been investing. And the real issue for them on the tech side, I think, is assuming that if it is as they claim that their technology really is much better, they have a perception problem more than anything. Because any website, anywhere has days. I mean, you know, the FT periodically doesn’t work. But because they have this reputation, any time it wobbles even a little bit, everyone’s like, oh look, it’s them again. And so stuff that they would completely tolerate from Walmart, they’re like, oh my god, Vanguard’s terrible tech. So that’s gonna be a matter of just proving that they can handle busy trading days, that they’ll be there, that it all works. And I think that takes time. Michela Tindera
So if Vanguard, you know, succeeds and does manage to push forward on these three areas they’re trying to work on, how does that impact the rest of the investment industry? Brooke Masters
I think it could be really scary for . . . particularly for the people who are known as wealth managers, who are the ones who give advice. Some asset managers have wealth management arms and give advice like Fidelity. But lots of places like private banks and you know, independent financial advisers who, you know, you go to them in their little office and they do stuff. If Vanguard’s actually out there offering a good product for a good price and frankly, Vanguard has a tremendous brand. I mean, people may get annoyed at their technology, but everybody believes they are doing their best, and what they offer is cheap and it’s in your interest. So basically, if you’re willing to take all computer advice, no human beings, they’ll give you an advice for one-fifth as much money. And if you have at least $10,000, which isn’t very much considering most Americans have retirement money, they’ll do it for basically a third of what the pay for wealth managers are doing. I mean, they are coming in and seriously undercutting the industry. And if people are comfortable with that and decide that they want that, that could really upend the business models of all of these companies. Michela Tindera
So what happens if Vanguard fails in any of these areas? I mean, does it have much to lose? Brooke Masters
I mean, I think what Vanguard would say is everything they invest is money they could have given back to their investors. So I think they can easily cancel things and stop. But that’s, I mean, that’s an admission of failure. And when you’re owned by your investors, you don’t want to be wasting their money. So I think it’s embarrassing. Or do I think it will undermine Vanguard’s success? Probably not. Michela Tindera
So as you mentioned, you know, for several decades, talking about Vanguard, their strategy has been cheap and cheerful, do you see that changing in the future? Do we give it a new name or is it more of the same? Brooke Masters
I think it’s still cheap for sure, but they are trying to use things like AI and behavioural economics to nudge people into doing all this stuff, rather than just laying their wares out and saying come if you want. They are actively trying to push you. Cheap and clever is what they would like to be. I’m not sure they’re gonna get there, but I think their hope is to someday be both cheap and clever. Michela Tindera
OK, so Vanguard led the charge for so long and they’re taking aim at new areas of financial services. I mean, what’s the lesson here, just don’t get complacent? Brooke Masters
I mean, the investment industry has been, you know, spent many years being fat and happy. They made a lot of money, they made some money for their customers because customers don’t know what they’re doing. Compare the profit margins in financial advice to the profit margins in, say, supermarkets, where people understand what they’re buying. Vanguard’s lesson is just because you’re selling a complicated product does not mean you can take an unfair share of the take. And what they have said is what people were used to paying, they don’t have to pay any more. And that’s a big change. Michela Tindera
And that’ll kind of continue as they move into these other areas to . . .  Brooke Masters
And they’re not the only ones. I mean, that’s the thing . . . I mean, Vanguard is big and famous and does this stuff but there are other cheaper alternatives. And I think that is pressing the advantage on that, that any part of the industry that has still got fabulous profit margins and is not having to compete for customers in the same way, should be on notice that you know, somebody is coming to get them.

Original music is by Hannis Brown. Topher Forhecz and Manuela Saragosa are our executive producers. Cheryl Brumley is the global head of audio. Thanks for listening. See you next week.",2025-02-25,This is an audio transcript of the Behind the Money podcast episode,"In a recent episode of the Financial Times podcast ""Behind the Money,"" hosts Michela Tindera and Brooke Masters discussed Vanguard, a major asset management company founded by Jack Bogle, who emphasized low-cost investing. Vanguard is known for its unique structure where investors own the company, allowing it to push fees lower. This ""cheap and cheerful"" approach transformed retail investing by promoting index funds—investments that mimic stock market indices instead of relying on expensive stock-picking experts.

Recently, Vanguard appointed Salim Ramji, its first external CEO, to lead new initiatives, including active bond management, high-yield savings accounts, and affordable financial advice, aiming to attract younger investors. However, Vanguard faces challenges, including improving technology and ensuring its traditional workforce adapts to new strategies.

If successful, Vanguard’s new offerings could disrupt the financial advice market, leading to significant competition for traditional wealth managers. Conversely, failure to execute could embarrass the firm without severely harming its overall stability. The key lesson from Vanguard's journey is to remain innovative and avoid complacency in an evolving market."

Michela Tindera
Recently, my colleague Eleanor Alcott took a trip to China’s southern Guangdong province. She travelled to a tiny farming village to visit the childhood home of Liang Wenfeng, the founder of the artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek.

Eleanor Olcott
We’ve just arrived in Liang Wenfeng’s village of Mililing. And there are lots of signs welcoming him home, lots of red banners saying that we celebrate your success. You can probably hear . . . 

Michela Tindera
That success Eleanor is talking about has to do with something very big that happened last month. You probably recall, this start-up DeepSeek shocked the world by proving that China could be competitive on AI. They showed they could potentially compete with the likes of American companies such as OpenAI or Meta.

Eleanor Olcott
We’ve just walked past Liang Wenfeng’s house. You can hear firecrackers going off in the background because it’s Chinese New Year and people singing karaoke as well. Liang and his parents left yesterday, apparently escorted by a bunch of security guards because they are being inundated by visitors from all over Guangdong coming to pay their respects.

Michela Tindera
Liang Wenfeng became a celebrity practically overnight, so much so that on Eleanor’s visit to Liang’s hometown, she found people who had travelled there just to see where this new hero of China had been raised.

Eleanor Olcott
(Conversation in foreign language)

So I spoke to this young teenager who travelled from Guangzhou to Mililing, this village. And I asked him what he thought of Liang Wenfeng. His response was really revealing and I think speaks to a broader attitude of the Chinese towards Liang.

(Conversation in foreign language)

He said that he’s a pragmatic technologist and actually because of him that China has been able to do something which, you know, they haven’t been able to do before, which is not only compete but also surpass the likes of OpenAI.

(Conversation in foreign language)

He’s become this kind of rallying call for Chinese pride, for Chinese sense of confidence in technology. And he said that Liang has made a big contribution to the country, a big contribution to China.

Michela Tindera
Now, all of this excitement around DeepSeek says a lot about the health of China’s tech sector. For years now, it’s been in a tough place.

Eleanor Olcott
Overall, the conditions are very difficult, especially for people in that kind of traditional internet space. We’ve seen structural changes to the economy, geopolitics and also Xi Jinping’s reforms. All of these have combined to dampen the entrepreneurial animal spirit in China.

Michela Tindera
So with the odds stacked against him, how did Liang Wenfeng do it?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

I’m Michela Tindera from the Financial Times. And this is Behind the Money.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

If you’ve been watching the tech sector for a while, you might remember a different era in China.

Eleanor Olcott
When internet giants like Alibaba and Tencent appeared unassailable, when their market cap was larger than tech giants like Facebook and Amazon, and foreign investors piled in to get a slice of these companies . . . 

Michela Tindera
But by the time that Eleanor joined the FT as our China tech correspondent in 2021, she told me that thinking back on it, her start date on her beat felt a little bit late to the party.

Eleanor Olcott
I think the starting point was really the end of 2020. We’ve seen a number of reforms that have basically made it less profitable to run some of these tech companies. In reaction to this, right, we saw foreign investors retreating from China because it became very clear that regulatory power in China was very strong and that you couldn’t be assured that your investments wouldn’t be vulnerable to kind of sudden change in winds on the regulatory side.

Michela Tindera
Beijing cracked down on tech companies that were considered to control too much of their market or to be not aligned with Communist party values. This led to a series of anti-monopoly investigations and restrictions on certain businesses like gaming and edtech. No surprise, this all hampered business, and all that intervention has been only part of the problem for China’s tech sector.

Eleanor Olcott
We obviously had the pandemic, which shut down large swaths of the country for several months on end. And this one in many ways is the most important when it comes to the perspective of the entrepreneurial environment, is that as foreign investors have retreated, we’ve really seen state investors, so those are local governments and state-owned enterprises in China, stepping in and playing a much bigger role in bankrolling innovation.

Michela Tindera
Here’s the thing. Funding from the state has sort of always been there for start-ups in China. But as Eleanor said, it’s taken on a bigger role as foreign investors have pulled back and that comes with some strings attached. State entities will, in essence, make you pay back the money they gave you if your company doesn’t succeed. This obviously makes starting a business feel riskier and way less appealing.

Eleanor Olcott
And this is really detrimental to the overall entrepreneurial environment because you’re suddenly asking a founder who’s, you know, launching a risky company that if they are unable to exit that investment, they are personally liable for that. It’s kind of a form of debt, as it were. So we’ve seen this kind of wave of founders go on the debtors’ blacklist and many, many really tragic stories of founders who, you know, have lost everything and have basically been forced to kind of put their house on the line, etc, because of this trend.

Michela Tindera
Which brings us back to the question: how did Liang Wenfeng do it? How did he create DeepSeek?

Could you just tell me very briefly, in a sentence or two, what is DeepSeek?

Eleanor Olcott
DeepSeek is a small AI start-up based in Hangzhou. It was formed out of a quant hedge fund by this mysterious billionaire, Liang Wenfeng, and they’ve been quietly plugging away, releasing more and more impressive models since late 2023. But really, the world finally woke up to them at the start of this year.

Michela Tindera
And why did the world wake up to them this year?

Eleanor Olcott
So they released a series of models that were on par with leading ones from the US rivals. So that was surprising, first of all, from a Chinese company. But it was doubly surprising, and this is really crucial, because they appear to be trained on a far fewer number of chips.

Michela Tindera
So tell me a bit more about the founder of DeepSeek. We know that he’s from this tiny village. But what about his professional life?

Eleanor Olcott
Liang Wenfeng is a quant trader by background. He’s a true engineer, someone who’s really obsessed with the technology. He really believes in the power of machines and believes that humans are fallible and that we should be trying to replace, you know, human fallibility with machines. So at the hedge fund, that means using algorithms instead of human decision-making. At DeepSeek, that means trying to achieve AGI, that is artificial general intelligence, ie, the point at which machines will be capable of human-level critical thinking.

Michela Tindera
So Liang Wenfeng is a math nerd. He’s been running a quant hedge fund called High-Flyer for about a decade in China. But around 2021, he became obsessed with the potential of AI to build something larger than his trading shop. And he started buying Nvidia chips in bulk for that purpose. They’re needed to train advanced AI models and all that turned out to be really good timing. That’s because by 2023, when Liang launches DeepSeek, the US has imposed really tough restrictions against selling Nvidia chips to China.

Eleanor Olcott
People at the time just thought he was this weird, eccentric billionaire who was pouring money into vanity projects. But it turned out that that was actually a really prescient bet because once the race to kind of replicate OpenAI started in China, DeepSeek and Liang were in a really good position vis-à-vis some of the competitors.

Michela Tindera
Now there’s a few things that Liang does to get DeepSeek off the ground. The first is that he stays far, far away from that state-backed, strings-attached financing that I mentioned earlier.

Eleanor Olcott
So this is an incredibly expensive endeavour. Not everyone has money to buy these expensive AI chips to build models. Liang Wenfeng is uniquely positioned to be able to do this. He’s incredibly wealthy from his quant trading days. So he’s kind of been channelling these resources into what was initially somewhat of a side project, but has now become his, like, his full-term focus.

Michela Tindera
So since he kind of self-funded this thing, Liang has the luxury of modelling DeepSeek in a way that’s similar to the early days of some of the AI giants like OpenAI and DeepMind, which is basically like a pure AI research lab. That means they’re not really worried about generating revenue right off the bat. It’s just experimenting.

Eleanor Olcott
So everything I said previously about the entrepreneurial environment being difficult because of the funding constraints doesn’t really apply to this company. And actually, part of the reason for that success, part of the reason why they’ve been pushing out such innovative models and have been able to open-source those is because they’ve been under no pressure to commercialise.

Michela Tindera
Liang also has something else that’s unique: the manpower from his quant fund to use and put toward this AI research.

Eleanor Olcott
High-Flyer had a group of extremely talented so-called systems engineers. These are guys who basically set up the computing infrastructure to do these trades. And it turns out that actually this kind of talent, the ability to construct the computing infrastructure, to execute these trades is actually very, very helpful when you’re also trying to squeeze as much computing power out of these chips in order to train large language models.

Michela Tindera
So, Eleanor, what else do we know about Liang Wenfeng?

Eleanor Olcott
He, like, really gets into the weeds of how the technology is developing and by all accounts, is someone who is really kind of obsessed with the detail and is like actively involved in the process of developing DeepSeek’s technology.

Michela Tindera
The result: a model that’s being hailed as China’s answer to Silicon Valley’s AI prowess.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Eleanor wrote her first story about DeepSeek back in June of last year, way before all of this attention from the west popped up. I asked her what it’s been like to watch the story unfold in China and what she thought it all meant.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Eleanor, so how did he end up on your radar so many months before this came out into the forefront of most people’s awareness?

Eleanor Olcott
I first actually heard of DeepSeek a couple of years ago. One of my contacts said that a very mysterious quant fund had gathered one of China’s largest cluster of Nvidia GPUs. I didn’t think much of it until this company started releasing their models. So they released their first one at the end of 2023. But they became more and more competitive.

Michela Tindera
Yeah. And so I guess how surprising was it to be writing about a tech start-up like this in the middle of 2024?

Eleanor Olcott
It wasn’t so surprising because actually generative AI has been one area where there’s been quite a bit of financing, nowhere near the scale of the US players, but has received a lot of money and explicit kind of government support. So it wasn’t really surprising in the bigger context, right? Like this is a complicated picture. It’s not the same in every single one of these sectors. But actually, you could also argue, aside from that, that DeepSeek is kind of the exception that proves the rule, right? It hasn’t raised any external financing. They haven’t been under pressure from the state investors or VCs to show that they can make money.

Michela Tindera
So, did you have the chance to interview Liang while you were working on that reporting last year? I mean, have you ever met him?

Eleanor Olcott
No, I did not interview him then. I’ve seen a whole bunch of western media since this has come out asking for interview requests. And I found that quite funny because that’s just not how things work in China. Right? Like if you’re a tech executive under such intense scrutiny, given the kind of heightened geopolitical environment, like they’re not going round giving interviews to the western media. He has given a couple of interviews to the Chinese press a year or so ago. And basically what’s been happening since then is people have just been, you know, trying to extract as much information from the very, very limited amount of public information there is out there on this guy.

Michela Tindera
And why is that? Is the pressure you’re talking about something that’s internal or external?

Eleanor Olcott
They’re worried about both. They’re worried about the Washington reaction because DC has put a lot of limits on Chinese companies that they view as making too many strides in certain areas of high-end technology. And they’re also worried about the Chinese reaction because we’re just kind of emerging out of this era where Big Tech companies that were making lots of money have been under intense scrutiny in China. So it’s kind of a lose-lose situation if you go out and you’re very loud about your successes.

Michela Tindera
Eleanor, they made this big splash, DeepSeek made this big splash. Obviously, Liang is getting all of this attention in China. But what is next for this company? What is on the near horizon for DeepSeek and for Liang?

Eleanor Olcott
So DeepSeek is really in growth mode right now. They’re going to be continuing to plug away and releasing more and more competitive models. It’s unclear, like precisely what their commercial plans are, if they have any. I’ve been hearing that they’re on a big hiring spree at the moment. And actually, this is a really good moment for DeepSeek because, you know, previously they might have found it difficult to court the best AI talent because they were somewhat of an unknown. But right now, like, they are the hottest company. They are the OpenAI of late 2022. Like, everyone wants to be a part of this organisation. It’s not entirely clear where they go from here or whether or not they’re going to commercialise their technology. But what is clear already is that they’ve sparked off a kind of chain reaction in China, where all of the other generative AI players are trying to absorb and replicate some of their learnings and really focus on some of the techniques that DeepSeek has been pioneering to drive down the cost of training and running these models.

Michela Tindera
So do you think there’s a scenario in which Liang gets kind of too big for himself? I mean, is that something that you’d worry about if you were him?

Eleanor Olcott
That is a very good question. Right? One thing that will be interesting to watch and I think potentially is a bit of an issue for companies like DeepSeek is Beijing has thus far been supportive of generative AI companies. But, you know, he’s looking to build AGI. He’s looking to build machines that are capable of human-level critical thinking. What will that mean for Beijing once they start seeing, you know, this technology becoming more and more competent? I do foresee there being some tensions between, you know, the way the technology is evolving and actually the political response to that. Something to keep an eye on for the future.

Recently, my colleague Eleanor Alcott took a trip to China’s southern Guangdong province. She travelled to a tiny farming village to visit the childhood home of Liang Wenfeng, the founder of the artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek. Eleanor Olcott
We’ve just arrived in Liang Wenfeng’s village of Mililing. And there are lots of signs welcoming him home, lots of red banners saying that we celebrate your success. You can probably hear . . .  Michela Tindera
That success Eleanor is talking about has to do with something very big that happened last month. You probably recall, this start-up DeepSeek shocked the world by proving that China could be competitive on AI. They showed they could potentially compete with the likes of American companies such as OpenAI or Meta. Eleanor Olcott
We’ve just walked past Liang Wenfeng’s house. You can hear firecrackers going off in the background because it’s Chinese New Year and people singing karaoke as well. Liang and his parents left yesterday, apparently escorted by a bunch of security guards because they are being inundated by visitors from all over Guangdong coming to pay their respects. Michela Tindera Liang Wenfeng became a celebrity practically overnight, so much so that on Eleanor’s visit to Liang’s hometown, she found people who had travelled there just to see where this new hero of China had been raised.  Eleanor Olcott (Conversation in foreign language)  So I spoke to this young teenager who travelled from Guangzhou to Mililing, this village. And I asked him what he thought of Liang Wenfeng. His response was really revealing and I think speaks to a broader attitude of the Chinese towards Liang.  (Conversation in foreign language) He said that he’s a pragmatic technologist and actually because of him that China has been able to do something which, you know, they haven’t been able to do before, which is not only compete but also surpass the likes of OpenAI.  (Conversation in foreign language) He’s become this kind of rallying call for Chinese pride, for Chinese sense of confidence in technology. And he said that Liang has made a big contribution to the country, a big contribution to China. Michela Tindera
Now, all of this excitement around DeepSeek says a lot about the health of China’s tech sector. For years now, it’s been in a tough place. Eleanor Olcott
Overall, the conditions are very difficult, especially for people in that kind of traditional internet space. We’ve seen structural changes to the economy, geopolitics and also Xi Jinping’s reforms. All of these have combined to dampen the entrepreneurial animal spirit in China. Michela Tindera So with the odds stacked against him, how did Liang Wenfeng do it?  [MUSIC PLAYING] I’m Michela Tindera from the Financial Times. And this is Behind the Money.  [MUSIC PLAYING] If you’ve been watching the tech sector for a while, you might remember a different era in China. Eleanor Olcott
When internet giants like Alibaba and Tencent appeared unassailable, when their market cap was larger than tech giants like Facebook and Amazon, and foreign investors piled in to get a slice of these companies . . .  Michela Tindera
But by the time that Eleanor joined the FT as our China tech correspondent in 2021, she told me that thinking back on it, her start date on her beat felt a little bit late to the party. Eleanor Olcott
I think the starting point was really the end of 2020. We’ve seen a number of reforms that have basically made it less profitable to run some of these tech companies. In reaction to this, right, we saw foreign investors retreating from China because it became very clear that regulatory power in China was very strong and that you couldn’t be assured that your investments wouldn’t be vulnerable to kind of sudden change in winds on the regulatory side. Michela Tindera
Beijing cracked down on tech companies that were considered to control too much of their market or to be not aligned with Communist party values. This led to a series of anti-monopoly investigations and restrictions on certain businesses like gaming and edtech. No surprise, this all hampered business, and all that intervention has been only part of the problem for China’s tech sector. Eleanor Olcott
We obviously had the pandemic, which shut down large swaths of the country for several months on end. And this one in many ways is the most important when it comes to the perspective of the entrepreneurial environment, is that as foreign investors have retreated, we’ve really seen state investors, so those are local governments and state-owned enterprises in China, stepping in and playing a much bigger role in bankrolling innovation. Michela Tindera
Here’s the thing. Funding from the state has sort of always been there for start-ups in China. But as Eleanor said, it’s taken on a bigger role as foreign investors have pulled back and that comes with some strings attached. State entities will, in essence, make you pay back the money they gave you if your company doesn’t succeed. This obviously makes starting a business feel riskier and way less appealing. Eleanor Olcott
And this is really detrimental to the overall entrepreneurial environment because you’re suddenly asking a founder who’s, you know, launching a risky company that if they are unable to exit that investment, they are personally liable for that. It’s kind of a form of debt, as it were. So we’ve seen this kind of wave of founders go on the debtors’ blacklist and many, many really tragic stories of founders who, you know, have lost everything and have basically been forced to kind of put their house on the line, etc, because of this trend. Michela Tindera
Which brings us back to the question: how did Liang Wenfeng do it? How did he create DeepSeek? Could you just tell me very briefly, in a sentence or two, what is DeepSeek? Eleanor Olcott
DeepSeek is a small AI start-up based in Hangzhou. It was formed out of a quant hedge fund by this mysterious billionaire, Liang Wenfeng, and they’ve been quietly plugging away, releasing more and more impressive models since late 2023. But really, the world finally woke up to them at the start of this year. Michela Tindera
And why did the world wake up to them this year? Eleanor Olcott
So they released a series of models that were on par with leading ones from the US rivals. So that was surprising, first of all, from a Chinese company. But it was doubly surprising, and this is really crucial, because they appear to be trained on a far fewer number of chips. Michela Tindera
So tell me a bit more about the founder of DeepSeek. We know that he’s from this tiny village. But what about his professional life? Eleanor Olcott
Liang Wenfeng is a quant trader by background. He’s a true engineer, someone who’s really obsessed with the technology. He really believes in the power of machines and believes that humans are fallible and that we should be trying to replace, you know, human fallibility with machines. So at the hedge fund, that means using algorithms instead of human decision-making. At DeepSeek, that means trying to achieve AGI, that is artificial general intelligence, ie, the point at which machines will be capable of human-level critical thinking. Michela Tindera
So Liang Wenfeng is a math nerd. He’s been running a quant hedge fund called High-Flyer for about a decade in China. But around 2021, he became obsessed with the potential of AI to build something larger than his trading shop. And he started buying Nvidia chips in bulk for that purpose. They’re needed to train advanced AI models and all that turned out to be really good timing. That’s because by 2023, when Liang launches DeepSeek, the US has imposed really tough restrictions against selling Nvidia chips to China. Eleanor Olcott
People at the time just thought he was this weird, eccentric billionaire who was pouring money into vanity projects. But it turned out that that was actually a really prescient bet because once the race to kind of replicate OpenAI started in China, DeepSeek and Liang were in a really good position vis-à-vis some of the competitors. Michela Tindera
Now there’s a few things that Liang does to get DeepSeek off the ground. The first is that he stays far, far away from that state-backed, strings-attached financing that I mentioned earlier. Eleanor Olcott
So this is an incredibly expensive endeavour. Not everyone has money to buy these expensive AI chips to build models. Liang Wenfeng is uniquely positioned to be able to do this. He’s incredibly wealthy from his quant trading days. So he’s kind of been channelling these resources into what was initially somewhat of a side project, but has now become his, like, his full-term focus. Michela Tindera
So since he kind of self-funded this thing, Liang has the luxury of modelling DeepSeek in a way that’s similar to the early days of some of the AI giants like OpenAI and DeepMind, which is basically like a pure AI research lab. That means they’re not really worried about generating revenue right off the bat. It’s just experimenting. Eleanor Olcott
So everything I said previously about the entrepreneurial environment being difficult because of the funding constraints doesn’t really apply to this company. And actually, part of the reason for that success, part of the reason why they’ve been pushing out such innovative models and have been able to open-source those is because they’ve been under no pressure to commercialise. Michela Tindera
Liang also has something else that’s unique: the manpower from his quant fund to use and put toward this AI research. Eleanor Olcott
High-Flyer had a group of extremely talented so-called systems engineers. These are guys who basically set up the computing infrastructure to do these trades. And it turns out that actually this kind of talent, the ability to construct the computing infrastructure, to execute these trades is actually very, very helpful when you’re also trying to squeeze as much computing power out of these chips in order to train large language models. Michela Tindera
So, Eleanor, what else do we know about Liang Wenfeng? Eleanor Olcott
He, like, really gets into the weeds of how the technology is developing and by all accounts, is someone who is really kind of obsessed with the detail and is like actively involved in the process of developing DeepSeek’s technology. Michela Tindera The result: a model that’s being hailed as China’s answer to Silicon Valley’s AI prowess.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Eleanor wrote her first story about DeepSeek back in June of last year, way before all of this attention from the west popped up. I asked her what it’s been like to watch the story unfold in China and what she thought it all meant.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Eleanor, so how did he end up on your radar so many months before this came out into the forefront of most people’s awareness? Eleanor Olcott
I first actually heard of DeepSeek a couple of years ago. One of my contacts said that a very mysterious quant fund had gathered one of China’s largest cluster of Nvidia GPUs. I didn’t think much of it until this company started releasing their models. So they released their first one at the end of 2023. But they became more and more competitive. Michela Tindera
Yeah. And so I guess how surprising was it to be writing about a tech start-up like this in the middle of 2024? Eleanor Olcott
It wasn’t so surprising because actually generative AI has been one area where there’s been quite a bit of financing, nowhere near the scale of the US players, but has received a lot of money and explicit kind of government support. So it wasn’t really surprising in the bigger context, right? Like this is a complicated picture. It’s not the same in every single one of these sectors. But actually, you could also argue, aside from that, that DeepSeek is kind of the exception that proves the rule, right? It hasn’t raised any external financing.

DeepSeek gained international attention after demonstrating AI capabilities that could rival major U.S. firms like OpenAI and Meta.

Liang, a skilled quant trader with a passion for AI, self-funded DeepSeek, allowing him more freedom than other start-ups that rely on state-backed financing, which comes with significant risks. His wealth from quant trading enabled him to invest heavily in necessary technology. DeepSeek aims to develop Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), meaning machines that can perform tasks requiring human-level thinking.

The podcast highlights the challenges faced by China's tech sector, including regulatory pressures and fluctuating foreign investment. Nevertheless, Liang's innovative approach and strategic timing, especially his advance purchase of Nvidia chips, positioned DeepSeek well in the competitive AI landscape. As DeepSeek continues to grow, its success may influence other generative AI companies in China. However, tensions might arise with the Chinese government as technology advances, particularly concerning the implications of AGI development."

Michela Tindera
The New York Stock Exchange is an institution.

Jennifer Hughes
It is one of the most famous exchanges in the world. It’s got this long history. It’s got this big building downtown.

Michela Tindera
And of course, it’s got that bell. (Sound of bell ringing)

Every weekday, Monday to Friday at 9.30am, a bell rings to mark the start of the main trading day.

Jennifer Hughes
It signals that the market is open. Stocks begin trading, companies like Coke, Apple and investors from big institutions to tiny retail traders, sitting on the couch at home — they’re all connected to this.

Michela Tindera
Each day, around $130bn worth of stock is traded on the NYSE. It’s the largest exchange in the world. And to mark the end of the main trading day, the bell rings again at 4 o’clock in the afternoon. These bells, they’ve been ringing like this for a long time.

Jennifer Hughes
So company executives who love their history, they dream about standing on that balcony over that trading floor and ringing the opening bell of this institution, which basically helped form corporate America.

Michela Tindera
Recently, though, the people who run the exchange have been considering making a big change. They proposed extending that day of trading stocks late into the night. But actually making overnight trading a reality is gonna be quite the challenge.

Jennifer Hughes
It’s just a massive undertaking. Think about the computers, the systems, the complexities of all these trades. There’s a lot that could go wrong.

Michela Tindera
So why does the New York Stock Exchange want to stay up all night?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

I’m Michela Tindera from the Financial Times. Today on Behind the Money, we’re looking at where this idea of overnight stock trading is coming from and how it’s affecting the decisions of major public marketplaces like the New York Stock Exchange.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Trading stocks overnight is pretty new in the scheme of things. But as US markets editor, it’s a trend that my colleague Jennifer Hughes has been watching with a lot of interest.

Jennifer Hughes
It’s about less than two years, really, 18 months ago, I think, is when a couple of the leading brokers started offering this. Most people like . . . want to sit on the sofa in the evening, they buy stuff on Amazon, they don’t trade Amazon shares. But there is this growing group that will do this, and the main overnight trading venue has volumes of about 40mn shares a night. It’s still a tiny fraction of what the New York Stock Exchange would do on any day, but it has grown rapidly.

Michela Tindera
Brokers like Robinhood that cater to retail traders are leading the charge into overnight trading. And that’s for a few reasons.

Jennifer Hughes
One of them is crypto trading. Crypto trading goes on 24/7. That showed everyone that there is interest in trading around the clock. We also had the growth of retail trading in the US during the pandemic. So you’ve got this sort of group of people who are more keen to trade at different hours. And we’ve also got Asian retail traders. There’s just so much retail trading in Asia and they’re very keen to trade US stocks. They want to trade Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft just like we do.

Michela Tindera
Jenn, isn’t it kind of interesting that such an established, renowned exchange like the NYSE is following the lead of retail traders? I mean, I’ve noticed that typically big financial institutions don’t really seem to care what retail traders are up to.

Jennifer Hughes
You’re right. Normally there’s retail trading and there’s sort of institutional big market trading. And the two of them go side by side, but they don’t necessarily affect each other. One of the things that interested me was the idea that suddenly all these Wall Street types might have their work patterns and flows and habits changed by, you know, a bunch of people trading Amazon at 10pm sitting on their sofa.

Michela Tindera
So as overnight trading has grown in popularity, it’s left the NYSE feeling a bit of Fomo.

Jennifer Hughes
If you’re the New York Stock Exchange, you are one of the most storied and most pre-eminent stock exchanges in the world. And here we have this market that’s growing up, in US stocks, which is what you’re known for. Would you really want somebody else to get that before you?

Michela Tindera
So that’s why the NYSE recently submitted a proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission that would offer trading during most of the night time. To be clear, those bells that I mentioned earlier are largely symbolic. The NYSE currently has before and after-hours trading sessions that are tacked on to the main trading day. The big change in this new proposal is that they want to have a full 22 hours of trading, Monday to Friday. This would mean starting at 1.30am eastern time and finishing at 11.30pm eastern time. Now, how they pull this all off comes with a lot of questions.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Now, Jenn, let’s get down to it here. I mean, so what if the New York exchange wants to tack on some extra hours of trading? Can’t they just hire some other staff to come in and do this and work a third shift or something?

Jennifer Hughes
Financial staff can be quite expensive, especially if you want them to work overnight. The issue is really that behind every trade there’s a whole lot of stuff that goes on. This is what we tend to call mid-office and back-office work. So you and I have hit the button, we’ve bought and sold our Amazon stock between us. But there’s two brokers — your broker, my broker — they have to agree the price and the size of the trade. They have to check their systems are all correct. And then they actually have to swap the shares and the money. And bear in mind, there are hundreds of millions of trades done just in US stocks every single day. And now think of how many times your phone or your laptop asks you to do a software update. Right?

Michela Tindera
A lot. All the time.

Jennifer Hughes
Mine, too — drives me nuts. But think how many times we need to do this. And then you think of these really massive, complex systems and suddenly we’re asking them to run basically 24 hours a day with very little downtime.

Michela Tindera
Yeah, that sounds like a lot. But what’s the worst that could happen?

Jennifer Hughes
The risk is that nobody would know quite where the music had stopped. So, for example, you went and put your order in for your Amazon shares and your broker told you it’s done. But the shares get transferred the next day. So have you actually got those shares? And if you haven’t, do you still have your money? Or have you lost your money and your shares? And think of that happening for like a million different trades every day.

Michela Tindera
So it’s pretty crucial to make sure that everything runs smoothly. Say a glitch in a trading system pops up overnight, figuring out who owns what could get very messy. Now, one of the biggest obstacles that the New York exchange would have to figure out is something that’s called the “tape”.

Jennifer Hughes
What exchanges do, because they are public marketplaces, they publish the best price all day long. This is consolidated into something known colloquially as the “tape”.

Michela Tindera
Picture essentially an old-fashioned typewriter, clickety clacking out constant updates to stock price information on long strips of paper. Now, picture that today but it’s happening electronically and a gazillion times faster.

Jennifer Hughes
If you bought Coca-Cola during the New York market daytime, there’s a price every second. Every millisecond, that price is adjusting and moving. Now your broker is required to get you the best price. Behind all of the trading infrastructure, there’s a lot of regulation designed to protect investors. So your broker has to get you the best price available. Exchanges have to publish that best price available all day. Your broker’s computer systems are talking to all the exchanges and finding that best price.

Michela Tindera
Publishing the tape is something that the NYSE has to do during trading hours. It’s an exchange, and that means it has to follow loads of regulations.

Jennifer Hughes
Exchanges are really like marketplaces. They’re where people have got together and establish rules for buying and selling. So everything is fair. The most important principle is that trading is fair and transparent. Exchanges are the important bit for the purposes of 24-hour trading because they come with all the infrastructure to make sure the people got the best price. They publish the records of trading prices, that sort of thing.

Michela Tindera
But Jenn says that transitioning that tape to tick around the clock will be the New York Exchange’s biggest hurdle to jump.

Jennifer Hughes
That’s just going to take time. And someone’s gonna have to decide whether they’re prepared to spend the money. Do they need to overhaul the system? Do they just need to upgrade the system? What does it require to run reliably for all this time?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Michela Tindera
Jenn, so we’ve talked about the so-called tape and the obstacles that come with that in an overnight trading environment. But are there any other concerns that we should be thinking about or other big steps that the New York exchange or other exchanges need to take?

Jennifer Hughes
It’s not just the exchanges, it’s the brokers as well. It’s making sure that everybody’s systems have enough time to do this. I mean, over the years, the trading systems have become so much more sophisticated. The amount of trading they can handle now versus a few years ago is incredible. But you still need time to test things to make sure things work. And we’re not sure just how much, at the moment, how much time that takes.

Michela Tindera
OK. So whose jobs or lives are likely to change the most with moving overnight? Is it mostly the traders?

Jennifer Hughes
It’s probably going to be more. To begin with, it would be the operations people, the people who have to deal with that reconciling of the trade behind the scene — the market plumbing, if you like that analogy. Those are the guys that are probably going to have to work on a tighter timetable to make sure things are done, when there is downtime, there’s going to have to be some human oversight of that. And almost certainly in the US as well. You can’t just hand it all over to a few extra staff in Asia, most likely, certainly not to begin with.

What you might get for the traders and the investors, the front office staff, I mean, what they fear is they will get more calls out of hours. It’s not often that a trader . . . you know, they act for other people a lot of the time. So it could be the trader goes, hey, this price has moved, did you want to trade at this price? And what if that call comes through at 11pm? That’s not going to be brilliant for your quality of life as an investor if you’re answering calls at 11pm as well as first thing in the morning.

Michela Tindera
Yeah, it’s just a job that kind of never ends in that scenario.

Jennifer Hughes
A bit like being a journalist.

Michela Tindera
Yeah, that’s . . . I’m sure plenty of people already feel that way. But another group to be included in that.

Jennifer Hughes
Yes, we can tell them that we feel their pain.

Michela Tindera
So if the New York Stock Exchange goes ahead with overnight trading and this gets approved, what do they stand to win?

Jennifer Hughes
It could be a lucrative market, should it turn into that. It could be prestige. It could be just keeping their place as the pre-eminent exchange. It could be marketing to the Asian day traders. It could be a bit of all of that. But clearly they felt it’s worth their while to go into something quite unproven, certainly in terms of trading volume and likely profitability, but get in there first and see where it’s going and probably, because they’re so big, direct how it goes as well, or help steer the direction in which this heads.

Michela Tindera
Are there any losers in this scenario?

Jennifer Hughes
People with sleep problems or people who will develop sleep problems? There aren’t necessarily losers. It depends how the trading goes. It could be that the other exchanges that don’t move as fast as the New York Stock Exchange may lose out, but I don’t have any massive losers.

Michela Tindera
So when should we expect to kind of understand if this is actually happening? What’s next?

Jennifer Hughes
There are a few steps to go. First of all, the New York Stock Exchange proposal, it’s currently before the Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC. So it needs approval. We’ll see how that goes. The SEC could come back with questions. That could be a longer process. We’ll just have to see how that plays out.

Cboe, the Chicago exchange, has also said they’re putting in a proposal. Now, we might get to a point, which some other people have already called for the market where instead of just saying yes to this exchange and yes to the next one, the SEC calls a bit of a pause on the whole thing and says, OK, OK, let’s consider this holistically. What do we want this market to look like? Do we want to go from 8pm in the evening? Do we want to have a break for two hours at the change of the day and come up with a single structure? Because what’s been notable about our conversation and all the conversations I’ve had about this is the amount of unknowns, the amount of ifs in all of this still. You get traders like what if this and what if this? We just don’t have the answers. And I mean, sometimes traders feed off volatility and the unknowns, but not when it comes to the market structure they trade upon.

Michela Tindera
Yeah, you can have the volatility and chaos within the structure.

Jennifer Hughes
You need two people with a different view of the price of Coca-Cola shares to make a market. Because you and I, you know, we might both be trying to buy at this price and it will push it higher. But yeah, if you’re not sure of the structure you’re trading on or the rules around trading, then this could all go horribly wrong.

Michela Tindera
So I know this is quite forward-looking, but we spent a good amount of time discussing all these different complications that could come up. So I’m just wondering, is all this effort gonna be worth it for the New York Stock Exchange, you know, at the end of the day?

Jennifer Hughes
At the moment, I would say there was more pride than profit in this. But down the line, who knows? If overnight trading really grows and really becomes a thing and the US stock market is effectively open 24 hours a day, the exchange that was the first mover in this space may well have an advantage and may well make more money out of it.

Michela Tindera
So final question, if the New York exchange does switch to overnight trading, what happens to the closing bell?

Jennifer Hughes
There will still be a closing bell, of that, I’m pretty sure, and it will still be 4pm. I mean, there’s a lot of technical reasons to keep it at that time, but let’s face it, most of us still prefer to work in the daytime.

The New York Stock Exchange is an institution. Jennifer Hughes
It is one of the most famous exchanges in the world. It’s got this long history. It’s got this big building downtown. Michela Tindera
And of course, it’s got that bell. (Sound of bell ringing) Every weekday, Monday to Friday at 9.30am, a bell rings to mark the start of the main trading day. Jennifer Hughes
It signals that the market is open. Stocks begin trading, companies like Coke, Apple and investors from big institutions to tiny retail traders, sitting on the couch at home — they’re all connected to this. Michela Tindera
Each day, around $130bn worth of stock is traded on the NYSE. It’s the largest exchange in the world. And to mark the end of the main trading day, the bell rings again at 4 o’clock in the afternoon. These bells, they’ve been ringing like this for a long time. Jennifer Hughes
So company executives who love their history, they dream about standing on that balcony over that trading floor and ringing the opening bell of this institution, which basically helped form corporate America. Michela Tindera
Recently, though, the people who run the exchange have been considering making a big change. They proposed extending that day of trading stocks late into the night. But actually making overnight trading a reality is gonna be quite the challenge. Jennifer Hughes
It’s just a massive undertaking. Think about the computers, the systems, the complexities of all these trades. There’s a lot that could go wrong. Michela Tindera
So why does the New York Stock Exchange want to stay up all night? [MUSIC PLAYING] I’m Michela Tindera from the Financial Times. Today on Behind the Money, we’re looking at where this idea of overnight stock trading is coming from and how it’s affecting the decisions of major public marketplaces like the New York Stock Exchange. [MUSIC PLAYING] Trading stocks overnight is pretty new in the scheme of things. But as US markets editor, it’s a trend that my colleague Jennifer Hughes has been watching with a lot of interest. Jennifer Hughes
It’s about less than two years, really, 18 months ago, I think, is when a couple of the leading brokers started offering this. Most people like . . . want to sit on the sofa in the evening, they buy stuff on Amazon, they don’t trade Amazon shares. But there is this growing group that will do this, and the main overnight trading venue has volumes of about 40mn shares a night. It’s still a tiny fraction of what the New York Stock Exchange would do on any day, but it has grown rapidly. Michela Tindera
Brokers like Robinhood that cater to retail traders are leading the charge into overnight trading. And that’s for a few reasons. Jennifer Hughes
One of them is crypto trading. Crypto trading goes on 24/7. That showed everyone that there is interest in trading around the clock. We also had the growth of retail trading in the US during the pandemic. So you’ve got this sort of group of people who are more keen to trade at different hours. And we’ve also got Asian retail traders. There’s just so much retail trading in Asia and they’re very keen to trade US stocks. They want to trade Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft just like we do. Michela Tindera
Jenn, isn’t it kind of interesting that such an established, renowned exchange like the NYSE is following the lead of retail traders? I mean, I’ve noticed that typically big financial institutions don’t really seem to care what retail traders are up to. Jennifer Hughes
You’re right. Normally there’s retail trading and there’s sort of institutional big market trading. And the two of them go side by side, but they don’t necessarily affect each other. One of the things that interested me was the idea that suddenly all these Wall Street types might have their work patterns and flows and habits changed by, you know, a bunch of people trading Amazon at 10pm sitting on their sofa. Michela Tindera
So as overnight trading has grown in popularity, it’s left the NYSE feeling a bit of Fomo. Jennifer Hughes
If you’re the New York Stock Exchange, you are one of the most storied and most pre-eminent stock exchanges in the world. And here we have this market that’s growing up, in US stocks, which is what you’re known for. Would you really want somebody else to get that before you? Michela Tindera
So that’s why the NYSE recently submitted a proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission that would offer trading during most of the night time. To be clear, those bells that I mentioned earlier are largely symbolic. The NYSE currently has before and after-hours trading sessions that are tacked on to the main trading day. The big change in this new proposal is that they want to have a full 22 hours of trading, Monday to Friday. This would mean starting at 1.30am eastern time and finishing at 11.30pm eastern time. Now, how they pull this all off comes with a lot of questions. [MUSIC PLAYING] Now, Jenn, let’s get down to it here. I mean, so what if the New York exchange wants to tack on some extra hours of trading? Can’t they just hire some other staff to come in and do this and work a third shift or something? Jennifer Hughes
Financial staff can be quite expensive, especially if you want them to work overnight. The issue is really that behind every trade there’s a whole lot of stuff that goes on. This is what we tend to call mid-office and back-office work. So you and I have hit the button, we’ve bought and sold our Amazon stock between us. But there’s two brokers — your broker, my broker — they have to agree the price and the size of the trade. They have to check their systems are all correct. And then they actually have to swap the shares and the money. And bear in mind, there are hundreds of millions of trades done just in US stocks every single day. And now think of how many times your phone or your laptop asks you to do a software update. Right? Michela Tindera
A lot. All the time. Jennifer Hughes
Mine, too — drives me nuts. But think how many times we need to do this. And then you think of these really massive, complex systems and suddenly we’re asking them to run basically 24 hours a day with very little downtime. Michela Tindera
Yeah, that sounds like a lot. But what’s the worst that could happen? Jennifer Hughes
The risk is that nobody would know quite where the music had stopped. So, for example, you went and put your order in for your Amazon shares and your broker told you it’s done. But the shares get transferred the next day. So have you actually got those shares? And if you haven’t, do you still have your money? Or have you lost your money and your shares? And think of that happening for like a million different trades every day. Michela Tindera
So it’s pretty crucial to make sure that everything runs smoothly. Say a glitch in a trading system pops up overnight, figuring out who owns what could get very messy. Now, one of the biggest obstacles that the New York exchange would have to figure out is something that’s called the “tape”. Jennifer Hughes
What exchanges do, because they are public marketplaces, they publish the best price all day long. This is consolidated into something known colloquially as the “tape”. Michela Tindera
Picture essentially an old-fashioned typewriter, clickety clacking out constant updates to stock price information on long strips of paper. Now, picture that today but it’s happening electronically and a gazillion times faster. Jennifer Hughes
If you bought Coca-Cola during the New York market daytime, there’s a price every second. Every millisecond, that price is adjusting and moving. Now your broker is required to get you the best price. Behind all of the trading infrastructure, there’s a lot of regulation designed to protect investors. So your broker has to get you the best price available. Exchanges have to publish that best price available all day. Your broker’s computer systems are talking to all the exchanges and finding that best price. Michela Tindera
Publishing the tape is something that the NYSE has to do during trading hours. It’s an exchange, and that means it has to follow loads of regulations. Jennifer Hughes
Exchanges are really like marketplaces. They’re where people have got together and establish rules for buying and selling. So everything is fair. The most important principle is that trading is fair and transparent. Exchanges are the important bit for the purposes of 24-hour trading because they come with all the infrastructure to make sure the people got the best price. They publish the records of trading prices, that sort of thing. Michela Tindera
But Jenn says that transitioning that tape to tick around the clock will be the New York Exchange’s biggest hurdle to jump. Jennifer Hughes
That’s just going to take time. And someone’s gonna have to decide whether they’re prepared to spend the money. Do they need to overhaul the system? Do they just need to upgrade the system? What does it require to run reliably for all this time? [MUSIC PLAYING] Michela Tindera
Jenn, so we’ve talked about the so-called tape and the obstacles that come with that in an overnight trading environment. But are there any other concerns that we should be thinking about or other big steps that the New York exchange or other exchanges need to take? Jennifer Hughes
It’s not just the exchanges, it’s the brokers as well. It’s making sure that everybody’s systems have enough time to do this. I mean, over the years, the trading systems have become so much more sophisticated. The amount of trading they can handle now versus a few years ago is incredible. But you still need time to test things to make sure things work. And we’re not sure just how much, at the moment, how much time that takes. Michela Tindera
OK. So whose jobs or lives are likely to change the most with moving overnight? Is it mostly the traders? Jennifer Hughes
It’s probably going to be more. To begin with, it would be the operations people, the people who have to deal with that reconciling of the trade behind the scene — the market plumbing, if you like that analogy. Those are the guys that are probably going to have to work on a tighter timetable to make sure things are done, when there is downtime, there’s going to have to be some human oversight of that. And almost certainly in the US as well. You can’t just hand it all over to a few extra staff in Asia, most likely, certainly not to begin with. What you might get for the traders and the investors, the front office staff, I mean, what they fear is they will get more calls out of hours. It’s not often that a trader . . . you know, they act for other people a lot of the time. So it could be the trader goes, hey, this price has moved, did you want to trade at this price? And what if that call comes through at 11pm? That’s not going to be brilliant for your quality of life as an investor if you’re answering calls at 11pm as well as first thing in the morning. Michela Tindera
Yeah, it’s just a job that kind of never ends in that scenario. Jennifer Hughes
A bit like being a journalist. Michela Tindera
Yeah, that’s . . . I’m sure plenty of people already feel that way. But another group to be included in that. Jennifer Hughes
Yes, we can tell them that we feel their pain. Michela Tindera
So if the New York Stock Exchange goes ahead with overnight trading and this gets approved, what do they stand to win? Jennifer Hughes
It could be a lucrative market, should it turn into that. It could be prestige. It could be just keeping their place as the pre-eminent exchange. It could be marketing to the Asian day traders. It could be a bit of all of that. But clearly they felt it’s worth their while to go into something quite unproven, certainly in terms of trading volume and likely profitability, but get in there first and see where it’s going and probably, because they’re so big, direct how it goes as well, or help steer the direction in which this heads.

See you next week.",2025-02-11,This is an audio transcript of the Behind the Money podcast episode,"In the ""Behind the Money"" podcast episode titled ""Can NYSE Stay Up All Night?"", hosts Michela Tindera and Jennifer Hughes discuss the proposal by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to extend its trading hours into the night. Currently, the NYSE opens at 9:30 AM and closes at 4 PM, trading approximately $130 billion daily. Overnight trading is a growing trend, partly spurred by the 24/7 nature of cryptocurrency markets and a rise in retail trading during the pandemic. 

Hughes notes that while other trading venues manage overnight volumes, the NYSE is keen to avoid losing market share, especially to companies like Robinhood that cater to retail traders. The NYSE's proposal seeks to offer 22 hours of trading from 1:30 AM to 11:30 PM, significantly increasing access to trading.

However, implementing this change is complex and costly. Each trade involves intricate back-office work to ensure accuracy, and the necessary systems must be able to handle constant trading without glitches. A critical concern is ""the tape,"" which records and publishes stock prices in real-time; adapting this for around-the-clock operation presents significant challenges.

If approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the NYSE could gain a competitive edge and enhance its prestige, but it must navigate many uncertainties and technical hurdles. The hosts conclude that while there may be pride in this ambitious move, profitability remains uncertain until overnight trading becomes more established. The traditional closing bell at 4 PM is expected to remain, emphasizing the enduring value of daytime trading."

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Michela Tindera
Recently, the United States has been far outpacing the rest of the world when it comes to producing one very important commodity. 

Amanda Chu
So every single day the US pumps more than 13mn barrels a day of oil. 

Michela Tindera
Thirteen million barrels of oil. That’s filling up 800 Olympic-sized swimming pools every day since 2023. 

Amanda Chu
That is the most the US has produced in its history and the most that any country has ever produced. 

Michela Tindera
The US is in first place for oil production ahead of Saudi Arabia, China, Russia. But for a while now, President Donald Trump has been saying that that isn’t enough. He said it on the campaign trail. 

Donald Trump voice clip
And now we’ve got to turn this country around and we’re going to turn it around fast and we’re going to drill, baby, drill.

Michela Tindera
He said it at the Republican National Convention. 

Donald Trump voice clip
We will drill, baby, drill. 

Michela Tindera
And in his inauguration speech last month. 

Donald Trump voice clip
That is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill. 

Michela Tindera
But as much as Trump wants to crank up oil production, there’s well, just one problem. 

Jamie Smyth
One of the ironic things about the oil industry’s close relationship with Trump is that he’s asking them to drill, baby, drill. But actually, the oil industry does not want to do that. 

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Michela Tindera
I’m Michela Tindera from the Financial Times. Today on Behind the Money, why Donald Trump’s calls for ramping up domestic oil production aren’t lining up with the reality of the current market.

I’m here with the FT US energy team. That’s editor Jamie Smyth and reporter Amanda Chu. Hey, guys. Welcome to the show. 

Jamie Smyth
Hi, Michela. 

Amanda Chu
Thanks very much for having us. 

Michela Tindera
So as we’ve established, the US has a lot of oil right now. So how did we get here? You know, thinking back, roughly 15 years ago, wasn’t everyone worried that we were going to run out of oil? 

Amanda Chu
Well, it’s all thanks to the shale revolution. So around 2010, we suddenly advanced in drilling technology and we were able to tap into these shale formations that we couldn’t before. And that really unleashed a lot of oil and gas production and completely transformed the US into the largest producer in the world right now. 

Michela Tindera
Right. So we’ve talked about the shale revolution on this show before, but let’s do a quick refresher. What is shale exactly? 

Jamie Smyth
Yeah, it’s a type of sedimentary rock which holds oil and gas within it. And the amazing thing about the shale revolution was fracking was invented and it was a technology that was able to split open the rock and extract the oil and gas. It just opened up huge extra reservoirs of gas. 

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Michela Tindera
Across the US, from Texas to North Dakota to Pennsylvania, oil companies started using this unique technology to unlock shale oil. Now, fracking, no surprise, is expensive. But funding wasn’t a problem when it came to shale. This way of accessing oil was super popular on Wall Street. 

Jamie Smyth
I think investors at the time were really willing to jump on board what was seen as a technological revolution. So hundreds of billions of dollars were raised, you know, from capital markets, IPOs. You got private equity getting involved. All different types of investors were rushing into the sector. 

Michela Tindera
And as a result, oil companies unlocked troves of liquid gold. That’s been a key reason that the US is in this number one spot in the global oil market today. So now we’re at the point where essentially we’re in this oil glut. So I asked Jamie, why does Trump want more drilling? 

Jamie Smyth
During the campaign, Trump said that he was going to slash energy prices in half if he was elected to office. So I think one thing he’s tapped into is the fact that inflation has really taken off in the US. Over recent years, it’s become a huge issue. And one way to bring prices down across the economy is to reduce energy prices. You’re thinking of transportation, you’re thinking of heating. You’re thinking of all these different parts, electricity in the economy. So if you can tackle the oil price, you get it done, well then he thinks he can control inflation. 

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Michela Tindera
Traditionally, Trump’s been a champion of the oil and gas industry and they’ve rallied behind him. Here’s the CEO of the American Petroleum Institute talking about the US election at a recent press briefing that Amanda attended. 

Mike Sommers voice clip
This past November, American energy was on the ballot, and American energy won. Whether it was EV mandates in Michigan or fracking in Pennsylvania, voters across the country and on both sides of the aisle sent a clear message to policymakers on what America’s energy future should look like. 

Michela Tindera
But now that Trump’s actually returned to the presidency, things seem different.

OK. And so how have oil companies been responding to this messaging from Trump, especially now that he is in office? What are they saying and doing? 

Amanda Chu
I mean, oil and gas companies are not following his marching orders when it comes to drill, baby, drill. And so what we see is that, you know, many of the large oil and gas producers, they’re keeping capital spending, which is, you know, spending on drilling. They’re keeping that either steady or they’re actually lowering their spending for this year. Chevron, at the end of last year announced that they were lowering their capital spending for 2025. And so this is the second-largest oil and gas producer in the US. And we also have Occidental Petroleum. They anticipate activity to remain steady. We have ConocoPhillips. I think they’re planning to reduce spending by around 500mn. So a lot of the largest players here are not planning on ramping up activity. 

Michela Tindera
Right. So that is completely at odds with what Trump is saying he wants from these companies. So why are oil companies against doing this right now? Why are they cutting spending and why are they against continuing to drill right now? 

Amanda Chu
Well, it’s because, you know, oil and gas companies, they respond to their investor interests. And, you know, we’re in an oil glut right now, as you mentioned. And that’s not really good for company profits. For the past couple of years, oil and gas investors have been really pushing for companies to keep spending flat and reward them with, you know, dividends and share buybacks. And so it’s not in the interest of Wall Street for these companies to all of a sudden spend a bunch of money to expand drilling and get a lot of oil for the price to be very low. And so oil and gas companies and Trump have different interests in mind. 

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Michela Tindera
So I want to talk a little bit more about how Trump and the oil companies are actually at odds here. Trump wants oil to be cheaper. He says that that’s going to bring down the cost of everyday goods. But oil companies actually want the price to go up. That’s what would make it worth it for them to drill more. 

Amanda Chu
Right now, the US oil price, it’s in the low $70 a barrel. It’s about $10 below the price of what producers say it needs to be for them to substantially boost drilling. 

Michela Tindera
And investors are eager for returns. They’ve been burnt before. 

Jamie Smyth
The shale industry has gone through two massive booms and busts over the last 15 years in the US. One of them was back in 2014 when we’d had a commodity supercycle driven by China, huge demand for oil and other minerals, and that came crashing to a halt as the Chinese economy stuttered. So that was the start of one big slowdown. And then we had the Covid pandemic where oil collapsed to minus prices, and that brought a shuddering halt to the whole industry and really cost, you know, thousands of jobs were lost, was huge pain across the sector. And that’s really coloured investors thinking and how they put dollars into the industry. 

Michela Tindera
Now, investors are right to be a little nervous. Global demand for oil is also weakening. And the reason is similar to 2014. 

Jamie Smyth
But this particular moment, the Chinese economy, which has been driving oil demand over the last couple of decades, is tapering off. You know, we’ve got a weak economy in China. You’ve also got an energy transition in China where there is a huge take up in electric vehicles, which is denting demand for gasoline in that country. And you’ve got quite a lot of supply, you know, held in reserve. Opec+ has something like 6mn barrels waiting to put back on the market. So we’ve got too much supply. We’ve got weakening demand. So in this case, investors are saying there’s no way we’re going to put loads more money into the sector because that’ll just cost us a lot of money. 

Michela Tindera
So oil companies have basically said that drilling more right now isn’t going to happen. So, Amanda, how is Trump trying to change their minds? 

Amanda Chu
Yeah. So on his first day in office, he signed a couple of executive orders declaring a national energy emergency. You know, even though production’s at record highs, he said he would call on agencies to consider the removal of electric vehicle subsidies and favourable regulations for that industry that would, you know, impact oil demand. He’s also lifted the Biden ban on offshore drilling leases. So he’s lifted a lot of the red tape. But, you know, as we see from companies’ earnings calls and from analysts, it’s not the red tape that’s impacting short-term oil production. It’s the price of oil and investors. And so Trump can ease policies, but they’re not going to drill more. 

Michela Tindera
So is there anything then that could change oil executives’ minds that would spark more drilling? What factors might come into play for companies to want to drill more? 

Jamie Smyth
Demand is the key, and the oil price is the key. So what we got to look for are things happening probably overseas, for example, the Middle East. If you had, as we have over the last year seen, there’s been tensions in the Middle East, if there was a risk of a conflict, that could push up prices into that level of somewhere between $80 and $100. That’s the sort of target area where you might see shale producers saying there’s money to be made. Let’s rush into the market. So we’re really looking to see events overseas. 

Michela Tindera
Amanda, what do you think? 

Amanda Chu
I mean, I think if we ever see a pivot away from this current, you know, we’re not going to drill, baby, drill strategy, I think we’re going to need a really long-term structural change in oil consumption. And it just doesn’t seem like we’re heading down that path. I mean, even if there is like a black swan scenario in the Middle East that triggers a spike in oil prices, we would really need something that would change oil market prices for the long term for drillers to change their strategy. And so it seems very unlikely that, you know, we’re going to see a change of course in the next four years. 

Michela Tindera
Now, we’ve been discussing President Trump’s various wishes for things that he wants to have happen during his administration. One of the biggest and most recent examples of that are the tariffs he said that he’d like to put on Mexico and Canada. What does the oil industry think of these? 

Jamie Smyth
The oil industry and, in particular, the multinational companies within the oil industry, are very concerned about tariffs because they work in a global industry. They’re selling their product to countries like China, Europe. And these are countries which are really in the crosshairs of Trump and his tariff plans. 

Michela Tindera
Now, at the time of this recording, we’re in a bit of a holding pattern with the tariffs on Mexico and Canada. But if these do come into effect, what impact would that have on the oil market? 

Jamie Smyth
Yeah. So we’ve seen that basically whenever you get uncertainty and this sort of talk about whether we’re going to get tariffs against Canada, Mexico, and we have actually got tariffs on China. So what that does is it brings uncertainty and that would push up the price of oil temporarily. But if tariffs get imposed and it hits global growth, then over the longer term, you could see the oil price falling and this glut increasing. You know, it could cause a lot of economic damage and that could push demand for oil down. And it will make producers even more nervous about investing further and drilling more to create more product. 

Michela Tindera
Where do you guys see the relationship between big oil companies and Trump going over the next four years? Will they turn on him? 

Jamie Smyth
I think the question could be more will Trump turn on them? I think that could be the issue. If they don’t deliver an increase in production, which brings down the price of oil and gas, then I think Trump tends to switch his positions rather quickly and he could well turn his fire on the big energy companies. And I think any company is quite wary of President Trump. And I think one of the reasons is it’s because of his personality and his willingness to attack people who are seen as critics. So that nervousness means that people are very willing to talk off the record and they’ll give you a good view of their real and valid concerns, particularly about issues like tariffs. But they’re not prepared to go on the record and speak out about that. 

Michela Tindera
So in the end, how should we think about these executive orders that Trump’s been signing? I assume there’s got to still be some good news in them for the oil industry, right? 

Jamie Smyth
I think this blizzard of executive orders, they’re not going to have a short-term impact on the US market. What they might do is they probably help oil producers over the medium to longer term because it really sends a signal that you’re going to be able to drill in the Gulf of Mexico or in other parts of the country. You’re going to be able to obtain these leases, which you will then be able to use in four, five, six years as long as there’s demand there.

But another point to think about is that oil companies consider their policies over the longer term. They invest over decades, whereas politics is very much a four-year cycle here in the US. So the companies are concerned that if there’s a wholesale changeover in environmental policies during this Trump presidency, that when his presidency comes to an end, we’ll get potentially a Democrat administration which will overturn all those policies again and they’ll have to race to catch up. What multinational companies in particular want is they want stability in policy. They want to know that they can invest their money now and in 10 years’ time, they can get a return. And that’s something that they’re going to find very difficult under President Trump.

Recently, the United States has been far outpacing the rest of the world when it comes to producing one very important commodity.  Amanda Chu
So every single day the US pumps more than 13mn barrels a day of oil.  Michela Tindera
Thirteen million barrels of oil. That’s filling up 800 Olympic-sized swimming pools every day since 2023.  Amanda Chu
That is the most the US has produced in its history and the most that any country has ever produced.  Michela Tindera
The US is in first place for oil production ahead of Saudi Arabia, China, Russia. But for a while now, President Donald Trump has been saying that that isn’t enough. He said it on the campaign trail.  Donald Trump voice clip
And now we’ve got to turn this country around and we’re going to turn it around fast and we’re going to drill, baby, drill. Michela Tindera
He said it at the Republican National Convention.  Donald Trump voice clip
We will drill, baby, drill.  Michela Tindera
And in his inauguration speech last month.  Donald Trump voice clip
That is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.  Michela Tindera
But as much as Trump wants to crank up oil production, there’s well, just one problem.  Jamie Smyth
One of the ironic things about the oil industry’s close relationship with Trump is that he’s asking them to drill, baby, drill. But actually, the oil industry does not want to do that.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Michela Tindera
I’m Michela Tindera from the Financial Times. Today on Behind the Money, why Donald Trump’s calls for ramping up domestic oil production aren’t lining up with the reality of the current market. I’m here with the FT US energy team. That’s editor Jamie Smyth and reporter Amanda Chu. Hey, guys. Welcome to the show.  Jamie Smyth
Hi, Michela.  Amanda Chu
Thanks very much for having us.  Michela Tindera
So as we’ve established, the US has a lot of oil right now. So how did we get here? You know, thinking back, roughly 15 years ago, wasn’t everyone worried that we were going to run out of oil?  Amanda Chu
Well, it’s all thanks to the shale revolution. So around 2010, we suddenly advanced in drilling technology and we were able to tap into these shale formations that we couldn’t before. And that really unleashed a lot of oil and gas production and completely transformed the US into the largest producer in the world right now.  Michela Tindera
Right. So we’ve talked about the shale revolution on this show before, but let’s do a quick refresher. What is shale exactly?  Jamie Smyth
Yeah, it’s a type of sedimentary rock which holds oil and gas within it. And the amazing thing about the shale revolution was fracking was invented and it was a technology that was able to split open the rock and extract the oil and gas. It just opened up huge extra reservoirs of gas.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Michela Tindera
Across the US, from Texas to North Dakota to Pennsylvania, oil companies started using this unique technology to unlock shale oil. Now, fracking, no surprise, is expensive. But funding wasn’t a problem when it came to shale. This way of accessing oil was super popular on Wall Street.  Jamie Smyth
I think investors at the time were really willing to jump on board what was seen as a technological revolution. So hundreds of billions of dollars were raised, you know, from capital markets, IPOs. You got private equity getting involved. All different types of investors were rushing into the sector.  Michela Tindera
And as a result, oil companies unlocked troves of liquid gold. That’s been a key reason that the US is in this number one spot in the global oil market today. So now we’re at the point where essentially we’re in this oil glut. So I asked Jamie, why does Trump want more drilling?  Jamie Smyth
During the campaign, Trump said that he was going to slash energy prices in half if he was elected to office. So I think one thing he’s tapped into is the fact that inflation has really taken off in the US. Over recent years, it’s become a huge issue. And one way to bring prices down across the economy is to reduce energy prices. You’re thinking of transportation, you’re thinking of heating. You’re thinking of all these different parts, electricity in the economy. So if you can tackle the oil price, you get it done, well then he thinks he can control inflation.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Michela Tindera
Traditionally, Trump’s been a champion of the oil and gas industry and they’ve rallied behind him. Here’s the CEO of the American Petroleum Institute talking about the US election at a recent press briefing that Amanda attended.  Mike Sommers voice clip
This past November, American energy was on the ballot, and American energy won. Whether it was EV mandates in Michigan or fracking in Pennsylvania, voters across the country and on both sides of the aisle sent a clear message to policymakers on what America’s energy future should look like.  Michela Tindera
But now that Trump’s actually returned to the presidency, things seem different. OK. And so how have oil companies been responding to this messaging from Trump, especially now that he is in office? What are they saying and doing?  Amanda Chu
I mean, oil and gas companies are not following his marching orders when it comes to drill, baby, drill. And so what we see is that, you know, many of the large oil and gas producers, they’re keeping capital spending, which is, you know, spending on drilling. They’re keeping that either steady or they’re actually lowering their spending for this year. Chevron, at the end of last year announced that they were lowering their capital spending for 2025. And so this is the second-largest oil and gas producer in the US. And we also have Occidental Petroleum. They anticipate activity to remain steady. We have ConocoPhillips. I think they’re planning to reduce spending by around 500mn. So a lot of the largest players here are not planning on ramping up activity.  Michela Tindera
Right. So that is completely at odds with what Trump is saying he wants from these companies. So why are oil companies against doing this right now? Why are they cutting spending and why are they against continuing to drill right now?  Amanda Chu
Well, it’s because, you know, oil and gas companies, they respond to their investor interests. And, you know, we’re in an oil glut right now, as you mentioned. And that’s not really good for company profits. For the past couple of years, oil and gas investors have been really pushing for companies to keep spending flat and reward them with, you know, dividends and share buybacks. And so it’s not in the interest of Wall Street for these companies to all of a sudden spend a bunch of money to expand drilling and get a lot of oil for the price to be very low. And so oil and gas companies and Trump have different interests in mind.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Michela Tindera
So I want to talk a little bit more about how Trump and the oil companies are actually at odds here. Trump wants oil to be cheaper. He says that that’s going to bring down the cost of everyday goods. But oil companies actually want the price to go up. That’s what would make it worth it for them to drill more.  Amanda Chu
Right now, the US oil price, it’s in the low $70 a barrel. It’s about $10 below the price of what producers say it needs to be for them to substantially boost drilling.  Michela Tindera
And investors are eager for returns. They’ve been burnt before.  Jamie Smyth
The shale industry has gone through two massive booms and busts over the last 15 years in the US. One of them was back in 2014 when we’d had a commodity supercycle driven by China, huge demand for oil and other minerals, and that came crashing to a halt as the Chinese economy stuttered. So that was the start of one big slowdown. And then we had the Covid pandemic where oil collapsed to minus prices, and that brought a shuddering halt to the whole industry and really cost, you know, thousands of jobs were lost, was huge pain across the sector. And that’s really coloured investors thinking and how they put dollars into the industry.  Michela Tindera
Now, investors are right to be a little nervous. Global demand for oil is also weakening. And the reason is similar to 2014.  Jamie Smyth
But this particular moment, the Chinese economy, which has been driving oil demand over the last couple of decades, is tapering off. You know, we’ve got a weak economy in China. You’ve also got an energy transition in China where there is a huge take up in electric vehicles, which is denting demand for gasoline in that country. And you’ve got quite a lot of supply, you know, held in reserve. Opec+ has something like 6mn barrels waiting to put back on the market. So we’ve got too much supply. We’ve got weakening demand. So in this case, investors are saying there’s no way we’re going to put loads more money into the sector because that’ll just cost us a lot of money.  Michela Tindera
So oil companies have basically said that drilling more right now isn’t going to happen. So, Amanda, how is Trump trying to change their minds?  Amanda Chu
Yeah. So on his first day in office, he signed a couple of executive orders declaring a national energy emergency. You know, even though production’s at record highs, he said he would call on agencies to consider the removal of electric vehicle subsidies and favourable regulations for that industry that would, you know, impact oil demand. He’s also lifted the Biden ban on offshore drilling leases. So he’s lifted a lot of the red tape. But, you know, as we see from companies’ earnings calls and from analysts, it’s not the red tape that’s impacting short-term oil production. It’s the price of oil and investors. And so Trump can ease policies, but they’re not going to drill more.  Michela Tindera
So is there anything then that could change oil executives’ minds that would spark more drilling? What factors might come into play for companies to want to drill more?  Jamie Smyth
Demand is the key, and the oil price is the key. So what we got to look for are things happening probably overseas, for example, the Middle East. If you had, as we have over the last year seen, there’s been tensions in the Middle East, if there was a risk of a conflict, that could push up prices into that level of somewhere between $80 and $100. That’s the sort of target area where you might see shale producers saying there’s money to be made. Let’s rush into the market. So we’re really looking to see events overseas.  Michela Tindera
Amanda, what do you think?  Amanda Chu
I mean, I think if we ever see a pivot away from this current, you know, we’re not going to drill, baby, drill strategy, I think we’re going to need a really long-term structural change in oil consumption. And it just doesn’t seem like we’re heading down that path. I mean, even if there is like a black swan scenario in the Middle East that triggers a spike in oil prices, we would really need something that would change oil market prices for the long term for drillers to change their strategy. And so it seems very unlikely that, you know, we’re going to see a change of course in the next four years.  Michela Tindera
Now, we’ve been discussing President Trump’s various wishes for things that he wants to have happen during his administration.

See you next week. ",2025-02-04,This is an audio transcript of the Behind the Money podcast episode,"In this Financial Times podcast episode, hosts Michela Tindera, Jamie Smyth, and Amanda Chu discuss why President Trump’s push for increased U.S. oil production is not aligning with the oil industry’s current strategies. The U.S. is experiencing record oil production, surpassing 13 million barrels per day, largely due to advancements in drilling technology, particularly the shale revolution which involves fracking to extract oil from sedimentary rock.

Despite Trump’s calls to “drill, baby, drill,” oil companies are hesitant to ramp up production due to several factors: there is an oil glut, prices are lower than what producers need to increase drilling, and investors are cautioning against expanding spending after previous market instabilities. Companies like Chevron and Occidental are either maintaining or reducing their capital spending. The investors' focus on maintaining profits and dividends further complicates the situation, as they prefer stable returns over aggressive drilling expansions.

Trump’s administration has attempted to influence oil production through executive orders and easing regulations, but industry leaders indicate that fundamental issues such as oil prices and global demand—currently impacted by a weakened Chinese economy and the rise of electric vehicles—are the true barriers to increasing drilling activity. Moreover, if geopolitical tensions lead to a potential spike in oil prices, there could be a shift in drilling strategies, but this remains uncertain.

Overall, the ongoing tension reflects differing priorities between the oil industry and the Trump administration, as companies seek stable long-term policies while Trump's short-term focus may clash with their financial interests."

Marc Filippino
President Donald Trump’s return to office has brought back his signature phrase in response to the news media — fake news. But this week, we saw the White House take things a step further. Trump will now be handpicking journalists for the White House press pool. Meanwhile, Jeff Bezos wants the Washington Post’s opinion section to steer clear of political takes.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

This is Swamp Notes, the weekly podcast from the FT News Briefing, where we talk about all the things happening in US politics. I’m Marc Filippino, and this week we’re asking: Can news outlets keep doing their jobs in the current political climate? Here with me now to discuss is James Politi. He’s the FT’s Washington bureau chief. Hi, James.

James Politi
Hi, Marc. Nice to be with you.

Marc Filippino
Good to have you. And we’ve also got Chris Grimes, who covers the business of media for the FT. Hi, Chris.

Christopher Grimes
Hi there. How are you?

Marc Filippino
Good. James, let’s start with you. For those who may not know, what is the White House press pool?

James Politi
So the White House press pool is a system, really, that’s set up by the correspondents who cover the White House for various news organisations to cover presidents in intimate settings. So when they’re in the Oval Office, when they’re on Air Force One, when they’re travelling to events. And who gets to go into those intimate settings is decided by the White House Correspondents’ Association, which is a group of journalists from various media organisations.

Marc Filippino
Right, and they make sure that different outlets get a turn. So one week it’ll be Politico, one week it’ll be another news organisation. And whoever is that day’s pooler distributes the information that they get to other news outlets. So, then what was the announcement this week made by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt? And why does it matter?

James Politi
The announcement made by the White House press secretary was that they would have control over who participates in the White House press pool, so they will get to decide who will be in those intimate settings with the president. It’s really about the idea that the government gets to choose who has close access to the White House and to the president in particular. And if that means that it’s, you know, specific reporters with ideological affinity or just generally sort of friendliness to the president, there won’t be as independent as other voices, then I think that’s where the, you know, concern comes in.

Marc Filippino
Chris, this is definitely not the first thing Trump has done that’s raising eyebrows with the press. You co-wrote a feature about this a couple of weeks back. What else are we looking at?

Christopher Grimes
Right, so even before the inauguration, Trump was already feuding with the press. He went after ABC News. He sued ABC News over the interview that he did with George Stephanopoulos and ABC and its parent company, Walt Disney, settled with Trump on that. And then there’s also been this ongoing dispute with CBS over the interview that 60 Minutes did with Kamala Harris. Trump has called this the biggest scandal in broadcasting history for the way that the 60 Minutes editors edited a promo for the interview, which was pithier than the actual longer interview.

And I’ve been talking to a lot of people over the last few weeks about this, and really, a lot of these lawsuits are pretty legally flimsy, but that doesn’t really matter. The point is to exert pressure on the media, keep them on the back foot. And I think Richard Nixon did this kind of thing, too. Not with the lawsuits, necessarily, but he was constantly attacking the press. The difference now from back in the Watergate days, when there was all that antagonism, is that a lot of these media organisations are no longer as financially secure as they were back then. Whether it’s newspapers or traditional broadcast companies, they aren’t the big beasts that they were in previous eras of this, you know, antagonism with the White House.

Marc Filippino
It’s a different world, right? And speaking of which, we now live in a world where one of our biggest tech moguls owns a major national newspaper. I’m, of course, talking about Jeff Bezos, who is both the owner of Amazon and The Washington Post. And Bezos this week instructed the outlet to basically write opinion pieces on just two topics: personal liberties and free markets. Chris, why are people talking about this as a piece of political news and, you know, not just an editorial policy?

Christopher Grimes
Well, I think the reason people are jumping to that is that, you know, one of the things that Bezos said in his memo about this was that, you know, that there was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, you know, had some kind of a responsibility to give opinions on lots of things. But he said, you know, all that stuff belongs on the internet now. Now, most people would think it’s an abdication of responsibility in a way to say that the Washington Post’s opinion page doesn’t have any role in or doesn’t have any interest in giving opinions about politics in Washington, right. It’s the capital, the centre of power of the Western world, blah blah blah.

James Politi
I mean, I think what’s especially interesting about the, you know, the Washington Post’s shift is that their editorial page has traditionally been fairly centrist, reflecting the Washington establishment, which generally takes moderate positions, sort of on both sides of the political spectrum and on many issues. And now it seems to be focused on sort of the pet projects of the owner, Jeff Bezos, rather than sort of the consensus of Washington, which has been, of course, overthrown by Donald Trump.

Christopher Grimes
So and I guess the elephant in the room here that we didn’t really address is why there’s scepticism about this. And you have to go back to the first Trump term to answer that. Trump didn’t like the coverage he was getting in The Washington Post, he started labelling it as the Amazon Washington Post. He said that Bezos’s ownership of the Washington Post was, quote, protection against an antitrust suit, which would probably seem pretty threatening if you run a company the size of Amazon. Trump also said that Amazon was getting away with murder tax-wise, which I guess you would also interpret as something of a threat.

Amazon later sued, claiming that the company had been denied a $10bn defence contract for cloud computing services because of, quote, escalating and overt pressure from the president. So, you know, Amazon does have a lot of business with the government. And you know, they don’t want policies that would go against their corporate interests. So, this is the reason that a lot of people are interpreting Bezos as what feels like a change in position since around the election.

Marc Filippino
I wanna go back to Donald Trump and this administration for a second and mention a couple of other things that I’ve read about that seem to encroach on the news media. So, you have the Pentagon, it’s asked legacy news organisations to vacate the spaces they’ve had reserved there as part of their coverage. The new head of the Federal Communications Commission Brendan Carr has asked about pulling funding from public radio and public television. What does Trump’s relationship during this administration look like versus his first time around as president? And also, you know, compared to other presidents?

James Politi
So I think what’s different now, compared to the first Trump administration and compared to previous administrations, is that to a certain extent, you know, all presidents want to exert some control over the media that covers them, tries to make their case, tries to spin them in every possible way. You know, Trump traditionally has attacked the media. He did that during his first presidency. And there was an adversarial relationship with some outlets in particular. I think what’s different now is that there are measures being taken, for instance, to restrict or to take control over who has access to the pool or who has offices in places like the Pentagon or other agencies that they hadn’t done before. So to that extent, it looks like the main difference is that they’re taking actions and not just sort of verbally attacking the media.

Christopher Grimes
Yeah. So I agree, I think presidents always complain about their coverage, right? But I think Trump is exceeding the pressure. This has just been a bazooka of action in the second term. It feels like he’s just trying to keep constant pressure on the mainstream press to keep them on the back foot and to try to tame them.

Marc Filippino
Guys, what do you make of this week in journalism and media as journalists? I mean, does it impact about the way you think about your jobs or you know, how you think of, you know, the industry generally? How are you approaching the next four years?

James Politi
I mean, this is certainly a changed backdrop. Especially, you know, these changes about, you know, that are coming from the White House and the way that they give access to the president through the pool. But I think from a reporting point of view, nothing really, you know, changes for us. You know, we continue to report factually and independently and try to tell the story of this, you know, kind of extraordinary upheaval that Trump is bringing to, you know, American politics, the world’s society in the best way that we can. And we sort of press ahead with that.

Christopher Grimes
Yeah, I would agree with that . . . When James and I got into this business, we knew that it was a really competitive one, and it’s been as long as I’ve been at it, which is quite some time now. There’s been new media pressure. The business model has changed like 10 times. And I think James is absolutely right. It doesn’t change anything about how we do this. I guess the worry that I have is making sure that the type of journalism that we do, and so many other people do so well, which is fact-based, fact-checked work that seeks to represent two sides of a story — that gets crowded out in a media landscape that is increasingly its influencers and its people who make no bones about having a viewpoint and a strong viewpoint, often an affiliation.

Marc Filippino
All right, guys, I wanna thank you both for a really interesting conversation. Chris Grimes covers the business of media from Los Angeles for the FT. Thanks, Chris.

Christopher Grimes
Thank you.

Marc Filippino
And James Politi is the FT’s Washington bureau chief. Thank you so much, James.

[MUSIC PLAYING] This is Swamp Notes, the weekly podcast from the FT News Briefing, where we talk about all the things happening in US politics. I’m Marc Filippino, and this week we’re asking: Can news outlets keep doing their jobs in the current political climate? Here with me now to discuss is James Politi. He’s the FT’s Washington bureau chief. Hi, James. James Politi
Hi, Marc. Nice to be with you. Marc Filippino
Good to have you. And we’ve also got Chris Grimes, who covers the business of media for the FT. Hi, Chris. Christopher Grimes
Hi there. How are you? Marc Filippino
Good. James, let’s start with you. For those who may not know, what is the White House press pool? James Politi
So the White House press pool is a system, really, that’s set up by the correspondents who cover the White House for various news organisations to cover presidents in intimate settings. So when they’re in the Oval Office, when they’re on Air Force One, when they’re travelling to events. And who gets to go into those intimate settings is decided by the White House Correspondents’ Association, which is a group of journalists from various media organisations. Marc Filippino
Right, and they make sure that different outlets get a turn. So one week it’ll be Politico, one week it’ll be another news organisation. And whoever is that day’s pooler distributes the information that they get to other news outlets. So, then what was the announcement this week made by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt? And why does it matter? James Politi
The announcement made by the White House press secretary was that they would have control over who participates in the White House press pool, so they will get to decide who will be in those intimate settings with the president. It’s really about the idea that the government gets to choose who has close access to the White House and to the president in particular. And if that means that it’s, you know, specific reporters with ideological affinity or just generally sort of friendliness to the president, there won’t be as independent as other voices, then I think that’s where the, you know, concern comes in. Marc Filippino
Chris, this is definitely not the first thing Trump has done that’s raising eyebrows with the press. You co-wrote a feature about this a couple of weeks back. What else are we looking at? Christopher Grimes Right, so even before the inauguration, Trump was already feuding with the press. He went after ABC News. He sued ABC News over the interview that he did with George Stephanopoulos and ABC and its parent company, Walt Disney, settled with Trump on that. And then there’s also been this ongoing dispute with CBS over the interview that 60 Minutes did with Kamala Harris. Trump has called this the biggest scandal in broadcasting history for the way that the 60 Minutes editors edited a promo for the interview, which was pithier than the actual longer interview.  And I’ve been talking to a lot of people over the last few weeks about this, and really, a lot of these lawsuits are pretty legally flimsy, but that doesn’t really matter. The point is to exert pressure on the media, keep them on the back foot. And I think Richard Nixon did this kind of thing, too. Not with the lawsuits, necessarily, but he was constantly attacking the press. The difference now from back in the Watergate days, when there was all that antagonism, is that a lot of these media organisations are no longer as financially secure as they were back then. Whether it’s newspapers or traditional broadcast companies, they aren’t the big beasts that they were in previous eras of this, you know, antagonism with the White House. Marc Filippino
It’s a different world, right? And speaking of which, we now live in a world where one of our biggest tech moguls owns a major national newspaper. I’m, of course, talking about Jeff Bezos, who is both the owner of Amazon and The Washington Post. And Bezos this week instructed the outlet to basically write opinion pieces on just two topics: personal liberties and free markets. Chris, why are people talking about this as a piece of political news and, you know, not just an editorial policy? Christopher Grimes
Well, I think the reason people are jumping to that is that, you know, one of the things that Bezos said in his memo about this was that, you know, that there was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, you know, had some kind of a responsibility to give opinions on lots of things. But he said, you know, all that stuff belongs on the internet now. Now, most people would think it’s an abdication of responsibility in a way to say that the Washington Post’s opinion page doesn’t have any role in or doesn’t have any interest in giving opinions about politics in Washington, right. It’s the capital, the centre of power of the Western world, blah blah blah. James Politi
I mean, I think what’s especially interesting about the, you know, the Washington Post’s shift is that their editorial page has traditionally been fairly centrist, reflecting the Washington establishment, which generally takes moderate positions, sort of on both sides of the political spectrum and on many issues. And now it seems to be focused on sort of the pet projects of the owner, Jeff Bezos, rather than sort of the consensus of Washington, which has been, of course, overthrown by Donald Trump. Christopher Grimes So and I guess the elephant in the room here that we didn’t really address is why there’s scepticism about this. And you have to go back to the first Trump term to answer that. Trump didn’t like the coverage he was getting in The Washington Post, he started labelling it as the Amazon Washington Post. He said that Bezos’s ownership of the Washington Post was, quote, protection against an antitrust suit, which would probably seem pretty threatening if you run a company the size of Amazon. Trump also said that Amazon was getting away with murder tax-wise, which I guess you would also interpret as something of a threat.  Amazon later sued, claiming that the company had been denied a $10bn defence contract for cloud computing services because of, quote, escalating and overt pressure from the president. So, you know, Amazon does have a lot of business with the government. And you know, they don’t want policies that would go against their corporate interests. So, this is the reason that a lot of people are interpreting Bezos as what feels like a change in position since around the election. Marc Filippino
I wanna go back to Donald Trump and this administration for a second and mention a couple of other things that I’ve read about that seem to encroach on the news media. So, you have the Pentagon, it’s asked legacy news organisations to vacate the spaces they’ve had reserved there as part of their coverage. The new head of the Federal Communications Commission Brendan Carr has asked about pulling funding from public radio and public television. What does Trump’s relationship during this administration look like versus his first time around as president? And also, you know, compared to other presidents? James Politi
So I think what’s different now, compared to the first Trump administration and compared to previous administrations, is that to a certain extent, you know, all presidents want to exert some control over the media that covers them, tries to make their case, tries to spin them in every possible way. You know, Trump traditionally has attacked the media. He did that during his first presidency. And there was an adversarial relationship with some outlets in particular. I think what’s different now is that there are measures being taken, for instance, to restrict or to take control over who has access to the pool or who has offices in places like the Pentagon or other agencies that they hadn’t done before. So to that extent, it looks like the main difference is that they’re taking actions and not just sort of verbally attacking the media. Christopher Grimes
Yeah. So I agree, I think presidents always complain about their coverage, right? But I think Trump is exceeding the pressure. This has just been a bazooka of action in the second term. It feels like he’s just trying to keep constant pressure on the mainstream press to keep them on the back foot and to try to tame them. Marc Filippino
Guys, what do you make of this week in journalism and media as journalists? I mean, does it impact about the way you think about your jobs or you know, how you think of, you know, the industry generally? How are you approaching the next four years? James Politi
I mean, this is certainly a changed backdrop. Especially, you know, these changes about, you know, that are coming from the White House and the way that they give access to the president through the pool. But I think from a reporting point of view, nothing really, you know, changes for us. You know, we continue to report factually and independently and try to tell the story of this, you know, kind of extraordinary upheaval that Trump is bringing to, you know, American politics, the world’s society in the best way that we can. And we sort of press ahead with that. Christopher Grimes
Yeah, I would agree with that . . . When James and I got into this business, we knew that it was a really competitive one, and it’s been as long as I’ve been at it, which is quite some time now. There’s been new media pressure. The business model has changed like 10 times. And I think James is absolutely right. It doesn’t change anything about how we do this. I guess the worry that I have is making sure that the type of journalism that we do, and so many other people do so well, which is fact-based, fact-checked work that seeks to represent two sides of a story — that gets crowded out in a media landscape that is increasingly its influencers and its people who make no bones about having a viewpoint and a strong viewpoint, often an affiliation. Marc Filippino
All right, guys, I wanna thank you both for a really interesting conversation. Chris Grimes covers the business of media from Los Angeles for the FT. Thanks, Chris. Christopher Grimes
Thank you. Marc Filippino And James Politi is the FT’s Washington bureau chief. Thank you so much, James.  James Politi Thanks, Marc.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Marc Filippino

Check back next week for more US political analysis from the Financial Times.",2025-02-28,This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode,"In a recent FT News Briefing podcast, discussions centered on President Donald Trump's approach to the media as he returns to office. Trump plans to select journalists for the White House press pool, allowing him to control who has close access to him. This raises concerns about media independence and the potential for biased reporting, as the selected journalists may align ideologically with Trump.

White House Correspondents’ Association typically manages press access for various news organizations, ensuring a rotation among reporters. However, Trump's direct involvement signals an attempt to exert more control over media coverage, differing from past administrations which mostly relied on verbal critiques.

The podcast also addressed Jeff Bezos's directive for The Washington Post to focus on opinions about personal liberties and free markets, ignoring broader political issues. Critics argue that this represents a retreat from the newspaper's traditional role in political discourse, particularly since it may reflect Bezos's personal interests.

Overall, the podcast highlights a shift in the media landscape where journalists face increasing pressure from political leaders as well as external forces affecting the stability of media organizations. Despite these challenges, the journalists emphasized their commitment to factual reporting and maintaining journalistic integrity."

Marc Filippino
Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Friday, February 28th and this is your FT News Briefing. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the White House and the pound is headed toward its best run in months. Plus, the AI Start-Up DeepSeek is pretty much everywhere you look in China these days.

Eleanor Olcott
The hype around DeepSeek is just unbelievable. And the pace at which DeepSeek is being spread across China is nothing short of extraordinary.

Marc Filippino
I’m Marc Filippino and here’s the news you need to start your day.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Keir Starmer met with US President Donald Trump yesterday. The topics ranged from trade with Europe to the economy. But the highlight was how the UK and the US will approach Russia, Ukraine and European security. Here to talk about Starmer’s visit is the FT’s Whitehall editor, Lucy Fisher. Hi, Lucy.

Lucy Fisher
Hi, Marc. Great to join you.

Marc Filippino
Good to have you back. So tell me, what did you make of Starmer’s visit?

Lucy Fisher
Well, I think Keir Starmer and Downing Street will be heaving a great sigh of relief this weekend as the trip went off without a hitch. You know, it felt very high stakes. And the two men in front of the cameras, in front of reporters largely presented quite a convivial projection. They did disagree on several matters. I think it’s important for Keir Starmer that he stood his ground in rebuffing Donald Trump in areas where he thought he was wrong.

But overall, Keir Starmer will be very happy with the work that is now underway for a UK-US trade deal focusing on the technology sector. And he will be more concerned about Donald Trump’s refusal and failure to confirm that Washington will provide a security backstop in Ukraine if we get to a ceasefire and any peace deal after that.

Marc Filippino
Yeah, I noticed that. And to that end, I want to play what Trump said about America’s military role in Europe when it came to the situation in Ukraine.

Donald Trump’s voice clip
If the British people are in Ukraine and they get attacked . . . You know, I’ve always found about the British, they don’t need much help. They can take care of themselves very well.

Marc Filippino|
And here’s what Starmer said in response.

Keir Starmer’s voice clip
But we’ve also always been there backing each other up between our two countries. That is why this is the greatest alliance for prosperity and security I think the world has ever seen.

Marc Filippino
Lucy, what did you glean from that interaction?

Lucy Fisher
Well, it’s quite worrying for, I think, the UK, which is at the forefront with France of European plans still at an early stage to provide a reassurance force in Ukraine after any ceasefire. But Keir Starmer has said repeatedly that this would need to be predicated on a fulsome US security backstop that would probably involve something like air cover and certainly access to satellites.

And what Trump said on Thursday was, you know, the US will be a backstop because we’ll be working in Ukraine. But really, when he was talking about that, he was referring to a minerals deal that he plans to sign with Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday. And I think this idea that the US will have a kind of vested interest in Ukraine on an economic front is just not enough to European leaders’ minds to reassure them that they can risk putting their own military personnel in Ukraine and that being sufficient to deter Russia from coming back and attacking the country, or indeed European forces inside it once again.

Marc Filippino
Let’s turn back to one of what’s considered the brighter spots from Starmer’s visit, which was the economic relationship between the two countries. You had mentioned a trade deal, what do we learn there?

Lucy Fisher
Well, not much detail on that front. It’s a deal that now has senior members of the US administration working on it, and we know that it will have technology at its core. Keir Starmer was very keen to stress that Britain and the US have worked together on technology in the past. And that the UK is going to swerve an approach of overregulation, which was clearly a bit of an oblique dig at Europe and the US concerns about Europe’s or the EU’s approach to the technology sector.

We also learned — which is good news, potentially for the UK — that Britain may receive carve-outs from Donald Trump’s tariff plans if indeed this trade deal can be agreed. So that will be a big win on the economic front for London if that comes off.

Marc Filippino
Lucy, what did this meeting tell you about how the relationship between the two leaders might continue to shake out during Trump’s second term?

Lucy Fisher
Well, it was very warm. Donald Trump said repeatedly that Starmer was a special man, and clearly his sort of soft spot for the UK was clear. He talked about his investments in Scotland, several golf courses he owns there. He said he was looking forward to coming soon. And Starmer rolled out a pretty smooth gimmick in saying he had a letter from the King that he wanted Trump to read right there in front of all the reporters in the Oval Office. And of course, it was the long-expected, unprecedented invitation for Donald Trump to undertake a second state visit to the UK. And I think it’s a clever move. So it feels like the wheels have been greased for quite a positive relationship between the two men so far.

Marc Filippino
That’s the FT’s Lucy Fisher. Thanks so much, Lucy.

Lucy Fisher
Thanks, Marc.

The pound is bouncing back. The British currency has climbed almost 2 per cent against the dollar in February. It’s on track for its best month since September. There are two things going on here: one, investors are unwinding their so-called Trump trades, which means they’re not so confident anymore that Trump’s return to the White House will fuel inflation and push up the dollar. The other reason for the boost in sterling is domestic. We’ve seen some surprisingly positive economic data out of the UK lately. Even though inflation is still above target, retail sales and GDP data were better than expected. Plus, the Bank of England is in a rate-cutting cycle, so investors are less worried about growth.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

The AI Start-Up DeepSeek rocked global markets in January when it released a new large language model. Now China is embracing it with open arms and it’s happening at lightning speed. Here to talk about it is the FT’s Eleanor Olcott. Hey, Eleanor.

Eleanor Olcott
Hi.

Marc Filippino
So to start off, just tell us what we’re seeing in China.

Eleanor Olcott
It’s only been a month since DeepSeek launched it’s R1 model — that’s its latest, most advanced model. And the pace at which DeepSeek is being spread across China is nothing short of extraordinary. We’ve seen just a huge rash of announcements from local governments, state-owned enterprises, private companies, from automobile makers to internet giants and also, you know, hospitals and educational institutions all rushing out these announcements saying that they’ve deployed DeepSeek.

Marc Filippino
OK, so what does that look like in practice? What are some specific examples?

Eleanor Olcott
I’ve heard examples of hospitals, doctors using DeepSeek models as a kind of diagnostic tool. So the model wouldn’t necessarily act as the primary tool for providing a prognosis and treatment plan for the doctors, but they might input that treatment plan and check whether or not that aligns with the model, or if two doctors have different opinions about a treatment plan, they will kind of use the DeepSeek models — the third-party arbiter — to resolve those differences.

There are also instances of police stations or law enforcement agencies using DeepSeek as a drafting tool for administrative reports. And financial institutions using it as an analytical tool as well. So there’s just many, many different settings for DeepSeek models here.

Marc Filippino
All right, so it sounds like it’s everywhere in China. How did it get that way?

Eleanor Olcott
There’s two things really, DeepSeek has made it much cheaper and easier to kind of deploy their models. They’ve open-sourced the technology, which has massively lowered the bar for people to kind of adapt to this. The other thing is, DeepSeek has been very openly embraced by Beijing. Liang Wenfeng — the founder — has been invited to various high-level public meetings. And really, this has filtered down into this top-down message to go ahead and deploy DeepSeek to kind of capitalise on the gains that it’s made in generative AI.

Marc Filippino
So DeepSeek’s Large Language Models or LLMs are incredibly popular. What’s next for the Start-Up?

Eleanor Olcott
Much of this is happening completely without DeepSeek’s involvement. It’s an open-source model, so anyone can just download the model and train it for its own application. It’s not a cloud provider. It doesn’t have like huge computing infrastructure to support this mass deployment. So really the beneficiaries of that would be the cloud providers like Huawei or Alibaba Cloud.

DeepSeek continues to be extremely focussed on research, ensuring that it’s pushing forward the frontiers of LLM research and getting to a situation where these models are even more capable and even more powerful and that continues to be its focus for now.

Marc Filippino
Do you think that DeepSeek can keep up the strong streak that it’s on?

Eleanor Olcott
The hype around DeepSeek is just unbelievable. It seems like every single Tom, Dick and Harry is deploying DeepSeek in some way. Now, there are reasons to treat some of these announcements with a very, very healthy dose of scepticism, right? Like, some companies definitely want to pile into this DeepSeek hype to boost their stock price. I’ve also been told on the government’s side that actually there’s a lot of internal pressure on state-owned enterprises or local governments to be seen to be aligning with China’s AI darlings.

So that doesn’t necessarily mean that the models are being, like, meaningfully deployed in actual kind of real-life settings. But I do think it represents a step change. The vibe has just completely changed here. You’re seeing this willingness to test out the technology to deploy it in so many different ways. And I think that will have a really long-term impact on China’s adoption and acceleration of AI.

They discussed trade, the economy, and particularly the ongoing situations in Russia, Ukraine, and European security. Starmer stood firm on issues where he disagreed with Trump, especially regarding US military support for Ukraine. Trump remarked on the UK's capability to manage its own security, which raised concerns for Starmer about a lack of a solid US security guarantee for Ukraine.

Starmer emphasized the importance of an upcoming UK-US trade deal focused on technology and hinted that the UK might receive exemptions from US tariffs if the deal is finalized. The meeting established a positive rapport between the two leaders, suggesting an amicable relationship as Trump enters his second term.

In economic news, the British pound has strengthened against the dollar, buoyed by positive UK economic data and a decrease in investors' confidence regarding Trump’s potential to spark inflation. 

Separately, the AI start-up DeepSeek has made significant inroads in China since its recent model launch, being rapidly adopted by various sectors including healthcare and law enforcement due to its open-source accessibility. This quick integration has been supported by government backing, although the extent of meaningful deployment remains to be seen."

Marc Filippino
Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Thursday, February 27th, and this is your FT News Briefing. Nvidia saw its revenues soar last quarter and the high cost of healthcare in China is hurting the country’s economy. Plus, US investors are kicking a lot of cash into UK football, and a lot of smaller clubs are seeing the benefits. 

Josh Noble
If you’re a billionaire and you want to dabble in owning a football club, it’s quite cheap, pretty low-risk, but you can have some fun along the way. 

Marc Filippino
I’m Mark Filipino and here’s the news you need to start your day.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Nvidia reported quarterly earnings yesterday and the chipmaker really outdid itself. The company said its sales increased 78 per cent year over year to more than $39bn. That blew Wall Street expectations out of the water. Nvidia expects that it will bring in around 43bn in revenue this quarter, which is what analysts more or less expect. Investors were happy with what they saw. Nvidia’s share price rose around 2.5 per cent in after-hours trading.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Over the past two decades. China has expanded its healthcare coverage to about 95 per cent of its population. Healthcare coverage for children, pregnant women and infectious diseases isn’t too far off what you might see in high-income countries. But the system still lags in some ways, and it’s taking a toll on China’s economy. Joe Leahy is the FT’s Beijing bureau chief, and he joins me now. Hi, Joe. 

Joe Leahy
Hi. 

Marc Filippino
So, Joe, what’s the problem with China’s healthcare coverage? It seems pretty expensive. 

Joe Leahy
You know, China’s invested a lot over the past few decades in healthcare, and it really has expanded the coverage. And in some areas, like you mentioned, it’s become quite advanced. But the problem really lies in some of these more chronic diseases and in the sort of quality of the coverage in different parts of the country, and in particular coverage of catastrophic healthcare expenditure is a problem. And what that means is, you know, when a family has someone who suffers a very serious illness, quite often the insurance does not cover the entire cost of that treatment, so they end up becoming impoverished from spending on medical care. That’s still a very big problem in China. 

Marc Filippino
Yeah. Can you give me a sense of just how big this problem is? 

Joe Leahy
A Lancet study found that 21.7 per cent of households suffered from this problem in 2018, which is the most recent figures available. When you compare it to other countries, it’s actually very high. And because healthcare is administered by region. When you get out into some of the poorer provinces, which tend to be in the interior or north-east of China, you do see a big difference. Quite often the incidence of catastrophic healthcare is higher. 

Marc Filippino
OK, so this is bad for these families. But what impact is this having on the broader economy? 

Joe Leahy
This is a major problem for families in terms of expenditure. So let’s say you’re a young couple. You have your parents and you have a child. You have to plan for every sort of contingency. So as your parents get older, you have to save more and more money just in case they suffer a problem like this, because you know that your health insurance may not cover it. So when you’re in that situation, you sort of save more and more and spend less. So in terms of the wider Chinese economy, these kinds of problems are often cited as reasons that Chinese consumers save a lot and don’t spend as much as in other countries. You know, China’s producing at its factories probably more than it needs, but people don’t have the funds to buy that or that they need to sort of maintain their savings to prepare for a rainy day. 

Marc Filippino
Right. And that rainy day could be a huge health scare that they would have to pay for. Joe, what are the authorities in Beijing doing about this? 

Joe Leahy
So next week, actually, at the annual meeting of China’s rubber stamp parliament, the National People’s Congress, we should see some stimulus measures from the government and the government has been talking about increasing social welfare expenditure. China has been increasing spending on its medical insurance faster than GDP for some time. But the problem here is that the cost of treatment has also risen rapidly over the years. So it’s more complex than just simply pouring more money into the problem. You won’t see this in the headlines of what they call the work report, which is presented at the start of the meeting, but it will be there in the fine print. It’s very hard for China to anticipate that kind of transformation from an economy that’s very export-oriented and very production-oriented towards a social welfare model like you might see in Europe. And Xi Jinping himself has said in the past that he doesn’t like welfarism. So I think we will see some language in this direction, but not wholesale reform that is probably needed.

BP is giving up on its role as a leader in the energy transition. Instead, it’ll make fossil fuels its top priority. CEO Murray Auchincloss said yesterday BP had been too optimistic when it decided to pivot towards green energy. Activist investors pressured BP to return to its oil roots. One of those activists being Elliott Management, which has built a nearly 5 per cent stake in the company. All right, so what does this plan look like? BP says it will increase oil and gas spending to $10bn a year, and cut expenditures on renewables by 70 per cent. Now, investors weren’t particularly psyched by the news. BP’s share price fell a little bit more than 2 per cent when the company published its strategy update on Wednesday.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Football, or you know soccer for us Americans, is known as the beautiful game. And UK football is looking very attractive to investors. International owners are pouring big bucks into clubs, including teams that are lower down the leagues. And that kind of money could change the state of football. The FT’s Josh Noble has written about this and he joins me now. Hi, Josh. 

Josh Noble
Hi. How are you doing? 

Marc Filippino
I’m doing well. This is an interesting story. So first off, can you set the scene for us? Big English soccer teams have had foreign owners for a while now. But we’re not talking about these million dollar giants like Chelsea or Man City. So what’s different about what’s going on now? 

Josh Noble
Well, what we’ve seen in recent years, not just in English football, but actually across European football, is a sort of steady flow of interest from investors from all over the world. In smaller football teams, we’re seeing some really rich people and rich companies come in and start to take an interest here. 

Marc Filippino
Yeah. Tell me about these lower league teams with overseas investors who are some of the more notable clubs we’re talking about and who owns them. 

Josh Noble
Recently we’ve seen a lot of activity in League One where you’ve got a really exciting top of the table clash between three clubs, one who will be well known around the world. Wrexham, owned by Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney. 

Marc Filippino
McElhenney is the the actor from Always Sunny in Philadelphia, right? 

Josh Noble
Yes, yes. So the little Hollywood sort of power duo behind Wrexham, then you’ve got Birmingham City, which is owned by Knight Head Capital, which is a US hedge fund, and then Wycombe Wanderers, not particularly glamorous side owned by a Kazakh billionaire. These three teams are vying for promotion at the top of the well it’s the third-tier of English football, so you’re quite a long way away from the Premier League, but there’s a lot of money flowing around in this league and everybody’s competing for those all important promotion spots. 

Marc Filippino
OK, but why would these wealthy investors go after the smaller teams we’re talking about instead of the bigger, more well-known teams? 

Josh Noble
Well, one is a question of opportunity. Big teams don’t come up for sale very often, and when they do, the price tags can be enormous. Wrexham as an example. The two Hollywood guys, they spent £2mn to buy that club. So your cost of entry is nothing compared to trying to buy into the Premier League. That also means that your risk is greatly reduced because you’re not buying a club that on day one, you’re having to fork out hundreds of millions of pounds a year on wages for players. And also you don’t have that same sort of media focus. So I think if you were in it to have a bit of fun, frankly, if you’re a billionaire and you want to dabble in owning a football club, it’s quite cheap, pretty low risk, but you can have some fun along the way. 

Marc Filippino
So looking forward, how is the investment in lower leagues going to impact soccer in the UK? Is it going to change the state of the game at all? 

Josh Noble
Well, I guess we’ve already seen it change the game because of this money flowing around in the lower leagues means that the quality of players at the top clubs moving around between the leagues is changing. So, you know, Wrexham, because of its wealthy owners, was able to attract players to the team when it was playing in the fifth tier. That would normally have expected to be in maybe the third tier. So you’ve now got increased competition for top players because you’ve got wealthy owners willing to spend. It also just means there’s intense competition at the top of these divisions. You’ve now got owners who are sort of wealthy and really want to win. So if you’re a club that doesn’t have a wealthy owner, things could get even harder. And we’ve seen that across European football for years now, but we haven’t seen it happen lower down the divisions before. 

Marc Filippino
So Josh, is this the new norm? Should we expect this kind of spending from here on out? 

Josh Noble
Well, I think the spending of this year will be a one-off. There is a push, a sort of regulatory push, to rein in some of this spending to stop wealthy owners with big pockets from outspending by such a degree, their rivals. So there’ll be new rules coming in in the summer, which basically means if you’re super-rich, if you put $100, £100 to your club, you’re only allowed to spend 60 of it on players. Those are relatively new ideas to football, and I think as that kind of gathers momentum, we should see things calm down a bit. 

Marc Filippino
Josh Noble is the FT’s sports editor. Thanks, Josh.

Thanks, Marc.

2. **China's Healthcare Crisis**: Although China has expanded healthcare coverage to 95% of its population, the high costs of chronic disease treatment still burden families, often leading to financial distress. This has resulted in reduced consumer spending as families save more for potential healthcare emergencies. The government may introduce some stimulus measures to address these issues during the upcoming National People’s Congress meeting, though significant reforms are not expected.

3. **Shifts in Football Investment**: US investors are increasingly buying into smaller UK football clubs, attracted by lower costs and reduced risks compared to larger teams. This trend is changing the competitive landscape in lower leagues, enhancing the quality of players and raising competition as wealthier owners invest in these clubs. However, future regulations may limit this spending to ensure fair competition.

Marc Filippino
Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Wednesday, February 26th and this is your FT News Briefing.

The US and Ukraine have struck a deal on minerals. And Unilever’s chief executive is headed towards the exit. Plus, Silicon Valley used to be a bastion of liberal ideals. Today, not so much. 

Hannah Murphy
You’ve certainly seen most, if not all, of those tech titans come out and support Trump in a way that they did not do during his previous term. 

Marc Filippino
I’m Marc Filippino and here’s the news you need to start your day.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Ukraine has agreed to a minerals deal with the US. The specifics are kind of vague, but a final version says that it would create a fund where Ukraine would contribute earnings from the future development of mineral resources, including oil and gas. The fund would then invest in Ukrainian projects. The US has also committed to backing Ukraine’s economy. The one big thing missing from the agreement, however, is any sort of US security guarantee. Officials in Kyiv hope this deal will be a first step towards that and help smooth over ties with Washington. Now, there are still a few details that need to be ironed out before the deal is signed. US President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy plan to meet on Friday.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Unilever’s boss, Hein Schumacher, was ousted on Monday. He’d been chief executive for less than two years and will now be replaced by chief financial officer Fernando Fernandez. The consumer goods company is known for brands like Ben & Jerry’s and Marmite, and is in the middle of a high-stakes restructuring plan. To talk all about it, I’m joined by the FT’s Madeleine Speed. Hi, Maddie.

Madeleine Speed
Hi, Marc. 

Marc Filippino
All right. So just to start us off, how are folks reacting to the news? 

Madeleine Speed
So the reaction to the news was one of shock by investors and by analysts. The share price dropped about 2 per cent in early trading, since recovered a little bit. But one analyst called it a bolt from the blue. The last basically 18 months since Schumacher has been chief executive of Unilever have been pretty successful. The share price is up about 10 per cent since he took helm of the company, so it’s been a massive surprise that this has happened. 

Marc Filippino
So, Maddie, can you give some background on the lead-up to this decision? 

Madeleine Speed
Yes. So Hein Schumacher was actually brought in himself to turn around the business. So Unilever had suffered from lacklustre performance for probably about a decade, number of mis-step, changes at the top, other chief executives ousted. And he’d come in really with a plan to revive growth and get things back on track. And he had a mandate from the US activist investor Nelson Peltz, who joined the board back in 2022, who had really been agitating for change at the company.

So in the time that Schumacher has been chief executive, he’s actually moved quite fast. I mean, contrary to what the board seems to think, he’s announced a wide-ranging restructuring plan. He made moves to cut 7,500 jobs from the company. He hived off the ice-cream business, which is known for brands like Ben & Jerry’s. But it’s obviously not been enough for the board. 

Marc Filippino
Clearly. Unilever said that Schumacher’s replacement, Fernando Fernandez, is, quote, better suited for the job. Why is that? 

Madeleine Speed
So Fernando Fernandez, who has been chief financial officer since January last year, is sort of seen as a go-getter. He’s seen as very results-oriented, a little bit more aggressive. One person described him to us as abrasive sometimes, and he kind of cuts a bit of a contrast to Schumacher, who’s seen as a little bit more conciliatory. One person said, cuddly, in fact. So I think the board, when comparing the two of them, thinks that Fernando Fernandez is really the guy to push for change at pace. 

Marc Filippino
All right, so Fernandez is on deck. What can we expect from him and Unilever from here on out? 

Madeleine Speed
I think the real question now from investors will be what Fernandez is going to do. Is he going to follow the program that Schumacher set out? Is he gonna continue selling off smaller food brands like Schumacher was and boosting growth with cost savings? Or is he going to do something more drastic?

There’s always a question mark with Unilever about whether they’re gonna sell off the entire food business, for example, and just be a beauty and personal and homecare business. So it would be really exciting to see what he decides to do. 

Marc Filippino
Madeleine Speed is the FT’s consumer industries reporter. Thanks, Maddie. 

Madeleine Speed
Thanks for having me, Marc.

The G20 isn’t getting a ton of love from finance ministers these days. They’re supposed to meet in South Africa this week. But sources tell the FT that a lot of them aren’t expected to come. That includes those from major economies like China and the US, but also from Brazil and India and Mexico. The G20 has struggled for relevance recently. The rivalry between the US and China hasn’t helped. And members are split over the response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent is staying close to home. Japan’s finance minister is sticking around Tokyo for state budget talks. And the EU’s economics commissioner will be in Brussels.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Silicon Valley used to be a hotbed of liberal activism, but not any more. Following the re-election of US President Donald Trump, Big Tech leaders have shifted to the conservative right, and their left-leaning employees aren’t exactly protesting. So is this the slow death of Silicon Valley activism? The FT’s Hannah Murphy has been looking into it, and she joins me now. Hey, Hannah. 

Hannah Murphy
Hey. Hi. 

Marc Filippino
One example of this turnaround, Hannah, is Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Can you tell me a little bit about his trajectory from liberal ally to Trump supporter? 

Hannah Murphy
Sure. As a start-up in the 2010s, Silicon Valley companies, including Facebook, now Meta, would attract workers with this promise of a culture of openness and transparency. Staff were told their views mattered and could sort of help shape the company, and Mark Zuckerberg would hold weekly, very open Q&A sessions with staff. They’re encouraged to speak out. Zuckerberg also embraced the more liberal values quite openly. We saw him marching about a decade ago at San Francisco’s gay pride parade, waving from a float that had a rainbow flag on the top.

This is a very far cry from the Mark Zuckerberg of 2025, which we saw go on the Joe Rogan podcast and call for more masculine energy in the workplace. And he’s also announced these big policy changes, sort of a weakening and undoing some hate speech policies, as well as doing away with the fact-checking programme. So, all in all, a very dramatic reversal from some of those more liberal pushes that we saw in the past. 

Marc Filippino
Yeah, and it was really striking to see him and other tech titans sitting front and centre at Trump’s inauguration a month ago. So to what extent does Zuckerberg reflect a larger change in Silicon Valley? 

Hannah Murphy
You’ve certainly seen most, if not all, of those tech titans come out and support Trump in a way that they did not do during his previous term. There’s a couple of reasons for this. One might be simply that from an idealistic point of view, they are more aligned with conservative values, particularly after you’ve seen the Biden administration go after the tech companies for areas like competition and antitrust, and perhaps have more testy relationships with some of those companies. It also can be seen as a sort of good business move if you are Meta and Mark Zuckerberg. Donald Trump has previously said that the company was censoring Americans and even threatened to jail Mark Zuckerberg. So obviously he will do everything to try and protect himself and his company from those threats. And I think as well, you’ve got to consider that perhaps rolling back some of these initiatives like DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — may be saving the company money. So there’s a possible business element here as well as the ideals side. 

Marc Filippino
How are employees at these companies responding? I mean, a lot of them are young and they probably lean left or they leaned left. Are they afraid to speak out? 

Hannah Murphy
I would say they’ve been put on notice by the companies essentially. So you’re seeing even sort of minor acts of defiance being stifled. You’ve got this issue of job security now, much more saturated jobs market in tech, given the rounds of lay-offs in recent years and a market downturn. So the possibility that you are let go and cannot find a job is very real and unnerving. And so you’re seeing a much quieter response from most Silicon Valley staff who may have in the past spoken up than previously. 

Marc Filippino
Hannah, do you think the cultural pendulum in Silicon Valley will swing back? 

Hannah Murphy
I think it’s more than a possibility. Often these companies will be very opportunistic in trying to make the most of whatever government is in power at the time and make sure they’re on the side of power. But I think the swing has been so dramatic this time that companies that do that will risk accusations of deep hypocrisy in a way that they haven’t previously. But I think it’s more than possible.

Today is Wednesday, February 26th and this is your FT News Briefing.  The US and Ukraine have struck a deal on minerals. And Unilever’s chief executive is headed towards the exit. Plus, Silicon Valley used to be a bastion of liberal ideals. Today, not so much.  Hannah Murphy
You’ve certainly seen most, if not all, of those tech titans come out and support Trump in a way that they did not do during his previous term.  Marc Filippino I’m Marc Filippino and here’s the news you need to start your day.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Ukraine has agreed to a minerals deal with the US. The specifics are kind of vague, but a final version says that it would create a fund where Ukraine would contribute earnings from the future development of mineral resources, including oil and gas. The fund would then invest in Ukrainian projects. The US has also committed to backing Ukraine’s economy. The one big thing missing from the agreement, however, is any sort of US security guarantee. Officials in Kyiv hope this deal will be a first step towards that and help smooth over ties with Washington. Now, there are still a few details that need to be ironed out before the deal is signed. US President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy plan to meet on Friday.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Unilever’s boss, Hein Schumacher, was ousted on Monday. He’d been chief executive for less than two years and will now be replaced by chief financial officer Fernando Fernandez. The consumer goods company is known for brands like Ben & Jerry’s and Marmite, and is in the middle of a high-stakes restructuring plan. To talk all about it, I’m joined by the FT’s Madeleine Speed. Hi, Maddie.  Madeleine Speed
Hi, Marc.  Marc Filippino
All right. So just to start us off, how are folks reacting to the news?  Madeleine Speed
So the reaction to the news was one of shock by investors and by analysts. The share price dropped about 2 per cent in early trading, since recovered a little bit. But one analyst called it a bolt from the blue. The last basically 18 months since Schumacher has been chief executive of Unilever have been pretty successful. The share price is up about 10 per cent since he took helm of the company, so it’s been a massive surprise that this has happened.  Marc Filippino
So, Maddie, can you give some background on the lead-up to this decision?  Madeleine Speed Yes. So Hein Schumacher was actually brought in himself to turn around the business. So Unilever had suffered from lacklustre performance for probably about a decade, number of mis-step, changes at the top, other chief executives ousted. And he’d come in really with a plan to revive growth and get things back on track. And he had a mandate from the US activist investor Nelson Peltz, who joined the board back in 2022, who had really been agitating for change at the company.  So in the time that Schumacher has been chief executive, he’s actually moved quite fast. I mean, contrary to what the board seems to think, he’s announced a wide-ranging restructuring plan. He made moves to cut 7,500 jobs from the company. He hived off the ice-cream business, which is known for brands like Ben & Jerry’s. But it’s obviously not been enough for the board.  Marc Filippino
Clearly. Unilever said that Schumacher’s replacement, Fernando Fernandez, is, quote, better suited for the job. Why is that?  Madeleine Speed
So Fernando Fernandez, who has been chief financial officer since January last year, is sort of seen as a go-getter. He’s seen as very results-oriented, a little bit more aggressive. One person described him to us as abrasive sometimes, and he kind of cuts a bit of a contrast to Schumacher, who’s seen as a little bit more conciliatory. One person said, cuddly, in fact. So I think the board, when comparing the two of them, thinks that Fernando Fernandez is really the guy to push for change at pace.  Marc Filippino
All right, so Fernandez is on deck. What can we expect from him and Unilever from here on out?  Madeleine Speed I think the real question now from investors will be what Fernandez is going to do. Is he going to follow the program that Schumacher set out? Is he gonna continue selling off smaller food brands like Schumacher was and boosting growth with cost savings? Or is he going to do something more drastic?  There’s always a question mark with Unilever about whether they’re gonna sell off the entire food business, for example, and just be a beauty and personal and homecare business. So it would be really exciting to see what he decides to do.  Marc Filippino
Madeleine Speed is the FT’s consumer industries reporter. Thanks, Maddie.  Madeleine Speed
Thanks for having me, Marc.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Marc Filippino The G20 isn’t getting a ton of love from finance ministers these days. They’re supposed to meet in South Africa this week. But sources tell the FT that a lot of them aren’t expected to come. That includes those from major economies like China and the US, but also from Brazil and India and Mexico. The G20 has struggled for relevance recently. The rivalry between the US and China hasn’t helped. And members are split over the response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent is staying close to home. Japan’s finance minister is sticking around Tokyo for state budget talks. And the EU’s economics commissioner will be in Brussels.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Silicon Valley used to be a hotbed of liberal activism, but not any more. Following the re-election of US President Donald Trump, Big Tech leaders have shifted to the conservative right, and their left-leaning employees aren’t exactly protesting. So is this the slow death of Silicon Valley activism? The FT’s Hannah Murphy has been looking into it, and she joins me now. Hey, Hannah.  Hannah Murphy

Marc Filippino
Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Tuesday, February 25th and this is your FT News Briefing. 

The US and Europe squared off at the UN yesterday. And Germany’s incoming leader has a pretty big to-do list. Plus, lots of US companies are putting their sustainability projects on the back burner, but not the commodities giant ADM. I’m Marc Filippino, and here’s the news you need to start your day.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

The US voted against a UN resolution condemning Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine yesterday. Since Donald Trump returned to the White House, the US has almost done a complete 180 on its stance on the conflict. Yesterday’s vote was the latest move in that turnaround. Trump has been trying to negotiate with Moscow to end the war. He said yesterday that he was open to forging an economic deal with Russia.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Friedrich Merz might have just won Germany’s high-stakes election, but he won’t have a ton of time to celebrate. The leader of the Christian Democrats has a lot on his plate. He needs to pull his country out of its economic slump, wrangle a divided Europe and figure out how to support Ukraine. But in order to do all of that, Merz will first have to tackle something called the debt break. The FT’s Laura Pitel joins me now from Berlin to explain. Hey, Laura. 

Laura Pitel
Hey, Marc. 

Marc Filippino
OK, so first things first. Just explain this whole debt break thing. What is it exactly? And why is it so important? 

Laura Pitel
So the debt break has become a kind of national institution, or as its critics call it, a fetish. It was enshrined in the constitution after the financial crisis, and it basically limits the amount that the German government can borrow to 0.35 per cent of GDP. So basically, it ties the hands of any government and really seriously limits how much they can borrow. Germans are very funny about taking on debt, and they’ve spent many years preaching to others in Europe about how they mustn’t take on too much debt. But the problem is that Germany badly needs all kinds of different investments, and a lot of economists just think they can’t do that without reforming this rule. 

Marc Filippino
And what sort of role has the debt brake played in German politics up until this point? 

Laura Pitel
Well, it became a huge bone of contention during the government that is on its way out, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The government had huge challenges because its period was dominated by Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which created an energy crisis and also massively increased the country’s defence spending needs. So after the invasion, Scholz announced a special €100bn fund to support the German armed forces. That required a change in the constitution to allow that to happen. But it didn’t stop the three parties and his coalition government from constantly bickering about spending and ultimately it triggered their downfall. Scholz fired his finance minister in November, and that triggered early elections, which finally happened this weekend. 

Marc Filippino
So if this €100bn fund couldn’t get approved without bickering, that means any additional spending by Merz is definitely going to be contentious. The problem is, Laura, he needs to push through these changes on the debt break. Can he do it? 

Laura Pitel
Well, the first thing to say is that Merz’s CDU has always been very fiscally hawkish, and their manifesto says that they are opposed to changing the debt brake in any way. That has changed pretty dramatically less than 24 hours after the election result.

The configuration of the new German Bundestag is such that it means that parties opposed to changing the debt brake to fund higher defence spending control a third of the seats in parliament. It matters because to alter the debt brake, you need a supermajority of two-thirds of the Bundestag because it’s constitutional change, and Merz doesn’t have that. And yesterday, he suggested that he might be open to doing something really quite unusual, which is using the old Bundestag majority, the one that’s about to be a thing of the past, to vote through a change in the debt brake because he’d have the votes in the old parliament, but not in the new one. 

Marc Filippino
But how can he do that if Merz is not yet chancellor? 

Laura Pitel
So there’s a slow transition of power. Merz has to try now to form a government, almost certainly with Scholz’s Social Democrats as the junior partner. That’s gonna take some time. And there’s a 30-day window where the old German Bundestag can still be convened and vote on any urgent matters. 

Marc Filippino
OK, so there’s this narrow window where Merz, with the help of Scholz, might be able to just push this debt brake change through. But I guess I’m wondering, what’s at stake more broadly if Merz isn’t able to do it? 

Laura Pitel
So I think there’s two sets of consequences. One is for Germany itself, the country badly needs investment in its infrastructure. At the same time, this incredibly challenging geopolitical environment, with basically the threat that decades-long security guarantees provided by the US to Europe are not gonna exist any more. Both of those challenges require money, billions and billions of euros. And although Merz has said in the past that he can find the money through savings, and also by boosting economic growth and thus generating more revenues, not many experts actually think that he can pull that off. Just the entire future of the continent of Europe is at stake here. 

Marc Filippino
Yeah, no big deal. That’s the FT’s Laura Pitel in Berlin. Thank you, Laura. 

Laura Pitel
Thank you, Marc.

Marc Filippino
President Donald Trump is all about bringing more manufacturing back to the US. And it looks like Apple is trying to tap into that. The company said yesterday it would hire 20,000 people in the US over the next four years and invest at least $500bn domestically. That includes spending on American suppliers and data centres, plus new initiatives like a training academy in Michigan. But Apple still relies heavily on suppliers and manufacturers in China to produce iPhones and other devices. That means the company is particularly vulnerable to Trump’s additional 10 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

The US commodities trader Archer Daniels Midland, or ADM, is doing something . . . well, it’s kind of doing something unusual these days. It’s sticking to its climate commitments. Now, a lot of companies have been doing the opposite. There’s been a lot of backlash against the green transition. And now we’re seeing looser regulations under President Donald Trump. The FT’s Susannah Savage is here to tell me what it means and why ADM is bucking the trend. Hi, Susannah. 

Susannah Savage
Hey. 

Marc Filippino
All right, so tell me more about ADM’s thinking here. What sort of sustainability commitments is it sticking to and why? 

Susannah Savage
The main way it’s doing this is with regenerative agriculture. So this is a farming approach which is designed to improve soil health and also capture and store carbon in the soil. So according to ADM, so far, they’ve rolled out regenerative programs in around 3mn acres, which has captured about 500,000 metric tons of CO₂ annually, the equivalent of taking 135,000 cars off the road. And they’re going to extend this to a further 2mn acres. So this is the main way that they’re cutting CO₂.

I was speaking to Ismael Roig, ADM’s president for Europe, Middle East and Africa. He said that, you know, climate change is here to stay. He said he doesn’t think it’s a thing that you can just shrug off and forget about. So I think the thinking there is that companies are going to be affected by climate change. It’s not going to go away. And so they have to continue to take action on it. 

Marc Filippino
And how unusual is ADM’s move here? I mean, to what extent are other companies walking back some of their green targets? 

Susannah Savage
So we have seen some companies sort of deprioritise sustainability and climate change, or say that it’s no longer a focus for them. Now this is all happening in the wake of the Trump administration rolling back a lot of green commitments. The major part of this is that the US is now no longer part of the Paris climate accord, and that makes the environment a lot more relaxed for companies operating in this space to ease off on their sustainability commitments. There have also been other things, like the halting of the IRA funding, which was funding things like sustainable agriculture programs.

Now, the agrifood industry is a really big contributor to global emissions, one of the largest. If you take it as a whole, you know, including farming and transport, from farm to fork, then it accounts for up to 37 per cent of global emissions, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. That’s a huge contribution as a whole. 

Marc Filippino
And ADM is a big part of that industry. To be clear, it is a massive company. But is what it’s doing enough to offset other companies backtracking from their climate goals? I mean, where can environmental advocates look for help? 

Susannah Savage
So one thing that Ismael did point out in our discussion was that where there have been companies looking at stepping back their commitments, that tends to be in the US. So somewhere you might look for hope is Europe. Europe has seen a political shift as well. But I think generally companies based in Europe or have a significant footprint in Europe are going to remain committed to their sustainability goals, or at least according to those who I’ve spoken to.

I mean, to what extent are other companies walking back some of their green targets?  Susannah Savage So we have seen some companies sort of deprioritise sustainability and climate change, or say that it’s no longer a focus for them. Now this is all happening in the wake of the Trump administration rolling back a lot of green commitments. The major part of this is that the US is now no longer part of the Paris climate accord, and that makes the environment a lot more relaxed for companies operating in this space to ease off on their sustainability commitments. There have also been other things, like the halting of the IRA funding, which was funding things like sustainable agriculture programs.  Now, the agrifood industry is a really big contributor to global emissions, one of the largest. If you take it as a whole, you know, including farming and transport, from farm to fork, then it accounts for up to 37 per cent of global emissions, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. That’s a huge contribution as a whole.  Marc Filippino
And ADM is a big part of that industry. To be clear, it is a massive company. But is what it’s doing enough to offset other companies backtracking from their climate goals? I mean, where can environmental advocates look for help?  Susannah Savage
So one thing that Ismael did point out in our discussion was that where there have been companies looking at stepping back their commitments, that tends to be in the US. So somewhere you might look for hope is Europe. Europe has seen a political shift as well. But I think generally companies based in Europe or have a significant footprint in Europe are going to remain committed to their sustainability goals, or at least according to those who I’ve spoken to.  Marc Filippino

Check back tomorrow for the latest business news. ",2025-02-24,This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode,"In the latest FT News Briefing podcast, Marc Filippino discusses key topics, including a UN vote where the US opposed a resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the electoral challenges faced by Germany's new leader, Friedrich Merz.

A significant focus is on Germany's ""debt brake,"" a constitutional rule limiting government borrowing to 0.35% of GDP. This rule restricts Germany's ability to invest, which is critical amid current economic pressures related to energy costs and defense spending needs following Russia's actions in Ukraine. Merz faces a tough task: modifying this rule to increase defense funding and support necessary investments, particularly as he leads a fiscally conservative party that has traditionally opposed such changes. To amend the debt brake, he requires a supermajority in parliament, which he currently lacks but may try to bypass using a transitional voting window.

Additional segments highlight Apple's plans to invest heavily in US manufacturing amidst rising tariffs, and Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) standing out for maintaining its sustainability commitments while many companies retreat from climate goals due to looser regulations under the Trump administration. ADM's approach emphasizes regenerative agriculture, which helps improve soil health and reduce carbon emissions. Overall, the podcast signals significant economic and political dynamics in both Europe and the US."

Kasia Broussalian
Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Monday, February 24th and this is your FT News Briefing.

Germany’s centre right came out on top in yesterday’s election. And all the political uncertainty in the US is starting to take a toll on Wall Street. Plus, we’ll take a look at how Beijing is getting creative at hiding its US Treasury holdings. I’m Kasia Broussalian and here’s the news you need to start your day. 

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Germany’s Christian Democratic Union or the CDU won the most votes in yesterday’s federal elections. Early results show the centre-right party winning just below 30 per cent of the ballots. 

[NEWS CLIP PLAYING]

That means the CDU’s leader, Friedrich Merz is set to become Germany’s next chancellor. But he’ll need to team up with at least one other party for a working majority. 

[NEWS CLIP PLAYING]

Merz has said he won’t govern with the number-two party. The far-right Alternative for Deutschland, or AfD, had its best night ever, came in with about 20 per cent of the vote. Instead, Merz will probably look to the centre-left Social Democrats, who finished third.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

US stocks had their worst day in two months on Friday. It came on the back of some pretty gloomy economic data, and the move cuts into the perceptions that Wall Street has been doing great ever since Donald Trump won the presidential election. Here to explain what’s going on is the FT’s Jennifer Hughes. Hey, Jenn. 

Jennifer Hughes
Hey, there. 

Kasia Broussalian
All right, so give me the rundown on the numbers here. What sort of decline are we seeing among US equities? 

Jennifer Hughes
So Friday, we saw the S&P down 1.7 per cent. That’s the biggest decline in two months. We are still up for the year. We did have a record high earlier last week, so we’re still near those kind of high levels, but we haven’t been going very far in recent weeks. So this perception, as we said, of a sort of a Trump rally, since the inauguration, the S&P is up 0.2 per cent. 

Kasia Broussalian
Yes, so that’s not like a huge jump. But I guess, what’s behind this most recent slump? Which economic indicators are making investors jittery? 

Jennifer Hughes
It’s really consumer sentiment and the inflation figures. These are the things we’re worrying about most at the moment. So inflation, we had stronger numbers for January than we thought we would. We’d had a . . . I call it a cautious outlook from Walmart. Then we had existing home sales data which showed a fall in existing home sales, people who just can’t really afford to move because rates are so high. And we also saw this big drop in another sentiment indicator. So this kind of suggests that the consumer might be reaching the end of the tether. And that’s something that would really worry people looking for growth. 

Kasia Broussalian
Well, that’s interesting because, you know, we’ve talked a lot on the show about how the Trump bump has really boosted markets ever since the election. So I guess, to what extent is this slump also maybe Trump-induced now? 

Jennifer Hughes
So far, I’d call it more of a Trump slide or a Trump hesitation in the markets. We’re looking at this barrage of executive orders and policies and plans and all sorts of actions that are going on, but we’re not quite sure what’s going to come out of it. For example, tariffs is a classic one for stocks because if you have a tariff, then we can start calculating what it might do to a certain company’s profits depending on the supply chain. But we don’t know at the moment. Everything is still likely to happen, possibly gonna happen, might get negotiated. It’s very hard for investors to make decisions on this. All this uncertainty sort of adds up to a Wall Street on hold at the moment. So I call it a Trump hesitation, although that doesn’t sound quite as good as a Trump slump. 

Kasia Broussalian
And as we know, markets hate uncertainty. So I guess what should we expect in the week ahead? 

Jennifer Hughes
Today should be interesting. We’ve had this pattern in recent months, well, recent years, frankly, of having a market wobble like we did on Friday. And then we get this surge of people buying on the dip. This is an opportunity to buy their favourite company a bit more cheaply. So if we see more of that, then we know that there’s still a lot of goodwill towards the market and the chance of more buying. If we do see a further sell-off, we might be in for a deeper correction. There’ll be lots of people who say that’s long overdue, but it could be a bit of a shock for people.

Jennifer Hughes

Kasia Broussalian
India and the UK are relaunching negotiations today on a new trade deal. Officials are meeting in New Delhi for two days of long-awaited talks. They first started back in 2022 but stalled out last year while both countries held elections. The hope now is that any agreement would kick-start investment, especially in sectors like advanced manufacturing, clean energy and financial services. A lot of the major details for a future deal have actually already been ironed out, but there are some sticking points. Among other things, New Delhi wants the UK to give its short-term workers visas.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

China isn’t holding as many US Treasury bonds as it used to. In fact, investors there have cut back to levels last seen in 2009. For years now, Beijing has been trying to diversify its assets, but its trend could also be a bit of a Jedi mind trick. My colleague Arjun Neil Alim has been looking into what’s going on. Hey, Arjun. 

Arjun Neil Alim
Hey. Thanks for having me on. 

Kasia Broussalian
Yeah, thanks for being here. So before we unpack my Star Wars reference, can you just give me a bit of background on China’s relationship with US Treasuries? I mean, how big of a player has the country been in this space? 

Arjun Neil Alim
The basic story over the last 25 years has been that China has sold more to the US than it’s bought. That’s left it with a store of dollars that it needs to put somewhere. It’s traditionally put those in US Treasury bonds, basically US debt. China is being one of the two largest sovereign holders of Treasury bonds, along with Japan. Now, China over the last 10 years or so has been actively moving to reduce its Treasury holdings. I think since 2011, it’s reduced the total value of its Treasury holdings by more than half a trillion US dollars. 

Kasia Broussalian
Got it. So back to my Jedi comment, can you explain how exactly China has been dumping these Treasury bonds? 

Arjun Neil Alim
Well, you’ve got to take the numbers with a pinch of salt. China is still holding a lot of Treasuries. It couldn’t sell down its Treasuries in a large way very quickly, unless it wanted to tank the price and lose money itself. So it’s not like it’s getting out of the Treasury market. But China’s financial authorities prefer to operate in the dark. What that means is China has been transferring some of its Treasury holdings to other accounts held in other countries, like Belgium or Luxembourg. So these will show up as Belgian holdings or holdings in Luxembourg, which don’t directly show up as Chinese holdings of US Treasuries. 

Kasia Broussalian
But I guess, why has China been trying to limit its exposure? 

Arjun Neil Alim
So analysts told us that China made a policy decision around 2010. Tensions between the US and China was starting to grow, and it became clear that the US and China were in an economic competition. And so if you are one of the largest holders of the sovereign debt of your biggest economic and geopolitical rival, it’s not a good look and it might leave you at risk. 

Kasia Broussalian
Right. And China kind of sat up at this point and realised that holding so much US debt probably wasn’t a great strategy any more? 

Arjun Neil Alim
Yeah. It is the intersection of geopolitics and finance. Like, China’s purchases of US Treasury bonds, ie allowing the US to have cheap debt in order to buy Chinese goods, is like the core of global finance. And the fact that that number is going down either shows that China is trying to decouple from the US financial system, or it shows that China is trying to hide the true extent of its Treasury holdings. And that’s very interesting. 

Kasia Broussalian
OK, so China is getting rid of some of its US Treasury holdings, but it’s also kind of just hiding some of what it owns. So how big of a deal are China’s moves here? 

Arjun Neil Alim
On a global level, this is a big deal. The yield on US Treasuries forms what we call the risk-free rate, which is the benchmark against which trillions of dollars of other assets are compared. If China’s getting out of the Treasury market, even marginally, this could reduce demand for Treasuries and hence push up yields, which in turn, it will make US debt more expensive. This poses a challenge to future US governments that want to spend more than they earn.

And finally, if you’re heading to a friend’s house in Brazil . . . 

[AUDIO CLIP PLAYING]

Don’t expect them to serve any coffee. 

[AUDIO CLIP PLAYING]

Videos have gone viral on social media. They’re showing people hiding cups of Joe as soon as the doorbell rings, and that hoarding is due to sky-high coffee prices. In Brazil, which is the world’s biggest producer, it’s up 40 per cent from last year. And under-caffeinated Brazilians aren’t happy about it. The increasing cost of the brew has become a symbol of wider frustration over inflation. Now that could spell trouble for President Lula da Silva. He’s up for re-election next year.

Marc Filippino
Donald Trump campaigned as the deregulation candidate. This week as president, he took more action to rein in financial watchdogs by issuing an executive order taking them under his control.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

This is Swamp Notes, the weekly podcast from the FT News Briefing, where we talk about all the things happening in US politics. I’m your host, Marc Filippino, and this week we’re asking: what does Trump’s grip on regulators mean for the business community? Here with me to discuss is Brooke Masters, the FT’s new US managing editor. Hi, Brooke.

Brooke Masters
Hi.

Marc Filippino
And we’ve also got Stefania Palma here with me in the DC studio. She’s the FT’s legal and enforcement correspondent. Hey, Stefania.

Stefania Palma
Hi, Marc.

Marc Filippino
All right Stefania, so let’s start with what happened this week. What was in the executive order that Trump issued on Tuesday?

Stefania Palma
So Trump essentially signed an executive order that, quote, reins in independent agencies. Some would argue that is a bit of an oxymoron, given that these agencies are in fact meant to be independent. But in practical terms, Trump essentially said the White House would be establishing performance standards for the federal agencies that they now must consult with the White House on things like their priorities or sort of broader strategic plans.

The order made a point of sort of highlighting that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy functions would not be captured by this new measure. That essentially means that presumably its supervisory functions would be captured by this. But the key kind of regulators that this applies to are things like the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is obviously sort of a top Wall Street watchdog, as well as the Federal Trade Commission, which is a key antitrust regulator.

Marc Filippino
Yeah, and also budgets will be adjusted, which kind of goes hand in hand with what’s going on at the Department of Government Efficiency with Elon Musk. So the big ones here are the Securities and Exchange Commission, as you mentioned, Stefania, and the Federal Trade Commission, the FTC. Brooke, why is Trump trying to rein them in? What is he troubleshooting for?

Brooke Masters
He’s following up on the general view of the business community that under President Joe Biden, Gary Gensler, who ran the SEC, and Lina Khan at the FTC, were both using regulation and enforcement cases to do things that were too constricting to business, that they have made it too hard to do business in America, and they wanna sort of unleash capitalism and, you know, generate more growth.

Marc Filippino
Is there anything in particular that the Trump administration might be targeting?

Brooke Masters
I think one of the obvious places where we’ve seen action is around crypto, where, for example, the SEC actually reversed guidance that the Gensler SEC had issued that made it hard for banks and asset managers to hold crypto. And they’ve said it’s fine. They did that within the regulatory framework, but I think they can also use this executive order to get rid of things. Similarly, they’ve been dropping cases involving crypto, which will therefore make it much easier for folks to keep pushing forward and bringing crypto more within the standard financial markets.

Marc Filippino
Guys, I wanna play a clip of the announcement of this executive order for you because it raises some questions for me. This is White House staff secretary Will Scharf speaking.

Will Scharf voice clip
Relating to independent agencies: This executive order would establish important oversight functions in the Office of Management and Budget and its subsidiary office, OIRA, supervising independent agencies and many of their actions, and also re-establishes the long-standing norm that only the president or the attorney-general can speak for the United States when stating an opinion as to what the law is.

Marc Filippino
Stefania, what do you make of that?

Stefania Palma
I mean, honestly, this really does kick off, I think, quite a fraught legal debate, in that, sure, the president does have oversight over the executive branch and federal agencies, but at the same time, federal agencies originate, some of them from Congress that essentially not only sometimes sort of create them, but also give them authority via legislation.

The whole point, some would argue, of regulators is their independence. In a sense, also because of levels of expertise, regulators like the SEC or the FTC really deal with very, at times, complex, dark corners of securities law and antitrust law that only specific experts, some would argue, would be able to look at and also enforce the law in these areas. But also, I think a statement like this kind of runs counter to the setup that — and perhaps a norm that has been followed for many years — which is that ultimately the regulators are the ones who think through things like regulation, who make decisions around enforcement without necessarily being encroached upon by the office of the president.

Marc Filippino
I just wanna mention that this definitely isn’t Trump’s first move towards deregulation since he’s come into office. You know, we talked a little bit about some of this stuff, but there have been stop-work orders, there have been mass firings and litigation. Regulations are being gutted from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Trump is actually, you know, he’s expected to do away with that bureau altogether. We don’t have time for all of it. But like, Brooke, these are meant to be business-friendly changes. What are you seeing on that front? Are they making businesses happy?

Brooke Masters
I think certainly you can see that bank stocks are doing really well. So, you know, investors in financial services think that the reining in of the SEC and the banking regulators is gonna be good for them.

There’s a lot more concern at places such as, like, in the pharmaceuticals industry, which is like, if you fire all the people at the FDA, who is going to approve the drugs? And ultimately, you know, drug companies make money through innovation and they do need someone to, you know, review their drugs.

So I think it’s one thing to, like, remove some of the rules, which, at least in the short term, does seem like it will boost business. It’s something completely different to remove the people who approve new things, because those are crucial functions of the government as well.

Marc Filippino
If you’re a business, I guess, what are some of the the pros and cons of operating in this environment, Brooke?

Brooke Masters
The rules of the road will be a lot more open. You probably can try more stuff. The chances that something could go terribly wrong go up. You know, when banks are less supervised and markets are free and easy, people push the boundaries. You know, they take big bets. They do interesting things. If the regulators are very disempowered, they can’t intervene early, which means the risk of a significant problem, either in like a mis-selling crisis or in some sort of systemic crisis, become higher.

Stefania Palma
I think it’s also worth maybe pointing out — oftentimes, business really likes and seeks predictability. If all of a sudden you see regulators no longer being able to kind of carry out their core functions without kind of a White House seal of approval, it kind of does shake up the normal pipeline of sort of functions that are taken up usually by federal agencies. So what does that really look like? I don’t think a lot of people do know that in practical terms.

Brooke Masters
I was going to say, actually, there’s also a moat issue, which is that if you are an established business that’s already invested in complying with rules, you would really rather not have those rules go away because they’re a moat against new players who will also have to invest. If suddenly you could do whatever the heck you want, all that money you’ve spent on hiring 10,000 compliance people is wasted.

Marc Filippino
That’s interesting. I wanna go back to this point of instability that Stefania brought up, because I spoke to one of our colleagues, James Fontanella-Khan who covers mergers and acquisitions. He reported that M&A is down this year compared to last year, which is kind of surprising given how pro-business Trump is. Meanwhile, there aren’t a ton of companies going public in the US, and it’s because there is this lack of stability. But the folks that James spoke to weren’t super concerned, and I wonder if it’s just a matter of them waiting for the dust to settle.

Brooke Masters
Some of it is they’re waiting for the dust to settle. I mean, it’s very hard to IPO a business that has any overseas business at all because, are there gonna be tariffs on Mexico? Are there gonna be tariffs on Canada? What about steel? So it’s hard to value a business. To float a new business, you have to say, this is what this company is worth. And I think because the rules keep changing, both on regulation and on other things, many company owners are reluctant to sort of thrust themselves to the market. And similarly with M&A, it’s, you know, if you’re buying something, how much is it worth? And will the Trump administration let you buy anything? Everything? Will they relax the rules or will they somehow come back? Nobody really knows.

Marc Filippino
Yeah. And then, you know, there’s the idea that, Stefania, that this executive order will almost certainly be challenged. Are there other ways that Trump could handicap regulators though? What do you think might be next?

Stefania Palma
I mean, I think what the administration has done so far has been quite broad — be it via sort of seeking to close down agencies altogether, as you pointed out, or sort of staff cuts, now coming up with an order, including a statement as broad as saying only the president and the attorney-general under the president’s supervision will be able to sort of establish what kind of the letter of the law is. I struggle, sort of, to see of how else you could challenge, I guess, the administrative state. But one of the kind of latest statements made by the administration this week also, for example, takes aim at administrative law judges. These are in-house court judges at federal agencies. And what the administration is claiming is that they have also the authority to fire these administrative law judges. That would be yet another broadside against how these regulators function.

Marc Filippino
You know, the judges thing is a really important point. Just on Thursday, the Department of Justice said that it was gonna drop a long-running case against Elon Musk’s SpaceX. So we’re seeing the influence on business from the government standpoint in a lot of different ways.

Brooke Masters
What I would say is that this executive order, I think, is the first time we’ve really seen a bold assertion of what’s known as unitary executive theory. There’s this theory that’s been floating around in conservative circles that basically everything that we thought we knew about the federal government, really, since the New Deal, is wrong and that this whole independent agency idea was a mistake and everything should be done by the executive. I mean, it undercuts literally, you know, 80, 90 years of precedent. And to have it inserted in an executive order is a big deal.

Marc Filippino
Brooke, I wanna bring things back to the business community for the last question. What are you hearing and what are you looking for in response to all this?

Brooke Masters
I think there’s a lot of sort of hiding under the desk, and no one wants to be singled out as somehow an enemy of the Trump administration, because they do seem to be willing to break all kinds of norms. So I think companies are very reluctant to say anything highly critical. And I think in general, business is still hoping that the general deregulatory tone and this slowing down of the administrative agencies and forcing them to do less will translate into continued stock market gains, but they are very worried about what else is out there.

This week as president, he took more action to rein in financial watchdogs by issuing an executive order taking them under his control.  [MUSIC PLAYING] This is Swamp Notes, the weekly podcast from the FT News Briefing, where we talk about all the things happening in US politics. I’m your host, Marc Filippino, and this week we’re asking: what does Trump’s grip on regulators mean for the business community? Here with me to discuss is Brooke Masters, the FT’s new US managing editor. Hi, Brooke. Brooke Masters
Hi. Marc Filippino
And we’ve also got Stefania Palma here with me in the DC studio. She’s the FT’s legal and enforcement correspondent. Hey, Stefania. Stefania Palma
Hi, Marc. Marc Filippino
All right Stefania, so let’s start with what happened this week. What was in the executive order that Trump issued on Tuesday? Stefania Palma So Trump essentially signed an executive order that, quote, reins in independent agencies. Some would argue that is a bit of an oxymoron, given that these agencies are in fact meant to be independent. But in practical terms, Trump essentially said the White House would be establishing performance standards for the federal agencies that they now must consult with the White House on things like their priorities or sort of broader strategic plans.  The order made a point of sort of highlighting that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy functions would not be captured by this new measure. That essentially means that presumably its supervisory functions would be captured by this. But the key kind of regulators that this applies to are things like the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is obviously sort of a top Wall Street watchdog, as well as the Federal Trade Commission, which is a key antitrust regulator. Marc Filippino
Yeah, and also budgets will be adjusted, which kind of goes hand in hand with what’s going on at the Department of Government Efficiency with Elon Musk. So the big ones here are the Securities and Exchange Commission, as you mentioned, Stefania, and the Federal Trade Commission, the FTC. Brooke, why is Trump trying to rein them in? What is he troubleshooting for? Brooke Masters
He’s following up on the general view of the business community that under President Joe Biden, Gary Gensler, who ran the SEC, and Lina Khan at the FTC, were both using regulation and enforcement cases to do things that were too constricting to business, that they have made it too hard to do business in America, and they wanna sort of unleash capitalism and, you know, generate more growth. Marc Filippino
Is there anything in particular that the Trump administration might be targeting? Brooke Masters
I think one of the obvious places where we’ve seen action is around crypto, where, for example, the SEC actually reversed guidance that the Gensler SEC had issued that made it hard for banks and asset managers to hold crypto. And they’ve said it’s fine. They did that within the regulatory framework, but I think they can also use this executive order to get rid of things. Similarly, they’ve been dropping cases involving crypto, which will therefore make it much easier for folks to keep pushing forward and bringing crypto more within the standard financial markets. Marc Filippino
Guys, I wanna play a clip of the announcement of this executive order for you because it raises some questions for me. This is White House staff secretary Will Scharf speaking. Will Scharf voice clip
Relating to independent agencies: This executive order would establish important oversight functions in the Office of Management and Budget and its subsidiary office, OIRA, supervising independent agencies and many of their actions, and also re-establishes the long-standing norm that only the president or the attorney-general can speak for the United States when stating an opinion as to what the law is. Marc Filippino
Stefania, what do you make of that? Stefania Palma I mean, honestly, this really does kick off, I think, quite a fraught legal debate, in that, sure, the president does have oversight over the executive branch and federal agencies, but at the same time, federal agencies originate, some of them from Congress that essentially not only sometimes sort of create them, but also give them authority via legislation.  The whole point, some would argue, of regulators is their independence. In a sense, also because of levels of expertise, regulators like the SEC or the FTC really deal with very, at times, complex, dark corners of securities law and antitrust law that only specific experts, some would argue, would be able to look at and also enforce the law in these areas. But also, I think a statement like this kind of runs counter to the setup that — and perhaps a norm that has been followed for many years — which is that ultimately the regulators are the ones who think through things like regulation, who make decisions around enforcement without necessarily being encroached upon by the office of the president.  Marc Filippino
I just wanna mention that this definitely isn’t Trump’s first move towards deregulation since he’s come into office. You know, we talked a little bit about some of this stuff, but there have been stop-work orders, there have been mass firings and litigation. Regulations are being gutted from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Trump is actually, you know, he’s expected to do away with that bureau altogether. We don’t have time for all of it. But like, Brooke, these are meant to be business-friendly changes. What are you seeing on that front? Are they making businesses happy? Brooke Masters I think certainly you can see that bank stocks are doing really well. So, you know, investors in financial services think that the reining in of the SEC and the banking regulators is gonna be good for them.  There’s a lot more concern at places such as, like, in the pharmaceuticals industry, which is like, if you fire all the people at the FDA, who is going to approve the drugs? And ultimately, you know, drug companies make money through innovation and they do need someone to, you know, review their drugs.  So I think it’s one thing to, like, remove some of the rules, which, at least in the short term, does seem like it will boost business. It’s something completely different to remove the people who approve new things, because those are crucial functions of the government as well. Marc Filippino

Check back next week for more US political analysis from the Financial Times.",2025-02-21,This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode,"In a recent episode of the FT News Briefing podcast titled “Swamp Notes,” host Marc Filippino discusses Donald Trump's executive order aimed at increasing presidential control over independent financial agencies, like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). 

Essentially, the order requires these agencies to consult with the White House on their priorities and strategies, despite their intended independence. Trump’s goal is to ease regulations, which many in the business community see as overly restrictive under President Biden. Areas of focus include cryptocurrencies, where the SEC has reversed guidance that complicated banks' ability to handle crypto assets.

This shakeup in regulation has generated mixed reactions. While bank stocks have risen, concerns exist about the long-term effects on critical functions, such as drug approval processes handled by the FDA, if staff cuts occur. Moreover, this change creates uncertainty in the business environment, making mergers and acquisitions less appealing due to unpredictable regulations.

Legal implications arise as constitutional debates emerge over the president's authority to dictate the functions of independent agencies. The executive order represents a significant shift in regulatory oversight and reflects an ongoing tension between executive power and the independence of regulatory bodies, which some argue is vital for effective governance. 

Overall, businesses are cautiously optimistic about potential deregulation but remain anxious about the implications for stability and oversight within their industries."

Marc Filippino
Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Thursday, February 20th, and this is your FT News Briefing. A major private equity firm made a splash with its bid for Thames Water. And HSBC is taking an axe to its spending. Plus, Germany’s battered manufacturing sector takes centre stage in this weekend’s election.

Patricia Nilsson
The industry is in crisis and a lot of people are starting to get worried.

Marc Filippino
I’m Marc Filippino, and here’s the news you need to start your day.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

KKR submitted a preliminary bid for a majority stake in Thames Water. We learned yesterday that the private equity firm is offering £4bn in equity. Thames Water is the UK’s largest water utility and is in a ton of debt. KKR isn’t planning to break up Thames Water. That’s really different from some of the other groups that are interested in the utility. The company overseeing the bidding process is expected to select the most credible offers by the end of the month.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

HSBC released its full-year earnings report yesterday and a lot is on the chopping block. It wants to cut $1.5bn. CEO Georges Elhedery announced a sweeping reorganisation in October designed to lower costs. Elhedery announced a bit more detail on the planned restructuring on Wednesday. Here to talk about it with me is the FT’s Kaye Wiggins. Hi, Kaye.

Kaye Wiggins
Hi.

Marc Filippino
So first off, tell me about the headline figure from this report yesterday. What does the $1.5bn figure mean exactly?

Kaye Wiggins
That is the amount of money that Georges Elhedery wants HSBC to cut from its annual cost base starting from next year. And what he wants to do with that is he wants to reinvest it into areas where he thinks the bank has a competitive advantage. So his priorities for getting a share of that money are areas like wealth management, transaction banking and also UK business banking, where he thinks the bank needs to increase its presence.

Marc Filippino
Yes. So what’s the back story here? Tell me a little bit more about the developments at HSBC that led up to this announcement.

Kaye Wiggins
So the background is this is the biggest overhaul-restructuring that HSBC has seen in a long time. And HSBC have always seems to have been in some form of restructuring. But this one is very dramatic. So what it involves is he is separating HSBC operations into two geographical units, eastern and western. He’s closing completely key parts of its investment banking business. So M&A advisory work and equity capital markets business in the UK, Europe and the US. Then he’s merging two of the three main units of the bank. And in the process of doing all of this, he is abolishing a kind of really expensive layer of senior bankers who will no longer be needed.

Marc Filippino
So how is this restructuring plan going to be implemented?

Kaye Wiggins
Well, so far, it’s a lot of job losses, essentially. There are lots of bankers who have had to reapply for their jobs because the job that they used to do has been deemed to duplicate a job that is being done elsewhere in the bank. So that’s gone from being two roles to one. So lots of bankers have been reapplying for the jobs and the people who didn’t succeed in getting that job have left. And we’ve seen a whole range of senior-level departures already. We can expect there may be some more to come as this goes on.

Marc Filippino
OK. So a lot of cuts are going to happen; could change the complexion of the bank. What are you looking out for when it comes to HSBC going forward?

Kaye Wiggins
Yes. One risk when banks do these kind of wide ranging dramatic restructurings is you can end up losing some of the better people that you might actually have wanted to keep and as they start looking for roles elsewhere because there seems to be a lot of uncertainty. One way they could get around that is by paying them higher bonuses if they stay. So it’s quite interesting in the results that we see that the bonus pool hasn’t been reduced. So you have to assume from that that there will be more money available to the senior bankers that stay, potentially.

Marc Filippino
Kaye Wiggins is the FT’s Asia financial correspondent. Thanks, Kaye.

Kaye Wiggins
Thanks.

Marc Filippino
The UK’s fight against higher prices just hit another bump in the road. Inflation ticked up to 3 per cent in January. That’s the highest it’s been in 10 months and more than what economists were expecting. The increase was driven by things like the price of food, non-alcoholic drinks, even private schools and airfares. And it’s all complicating the Bank of England’s plan to cut interest rates. The BOE has slashed rates three times since last summer, but analysts now think it’ll have to slow the pace a bit going forward. Traders are still betting on two more quarter point cuts this year, just maybe not at next month’s meeting.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Germany is holding early federal elections this weekend. If you remember, they were triggered after current Chancellor Olaf Scholz pulled the plug on his coalition late last year and then lost a no-confidence vote. Now, there is a lot of focus on the economy as Germans go to the polls. The country’s industrial heartland has been hit real hard recently. I’ve got the FT’s Frankfurt correspondent Patricia Nilsson with us to talk about it. Hi, Patricia.

Patricia Nilsson
Hi, Marc.

Marc Filippino
So lay out the situation for me, Patricia. Just how rough has it been for German manufacturing in recent years?

Patricia Nilsson
So if you look at employment figures, Germany has lost nearly a quarter of a million manufacturing jobs since the start of the pandemic. A lot of Germany’s largest industries have been hit pretty badly. For example, Germany’s car industry. BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen are all selling fewer cars and struggling with high costs when it comes to the transition to electric vehicles. But Germany also has a lot of energy-intensive industries such as chemicals or a steel industry, for example. And these types of companies are really reliant on cheap energy, which before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, they had plenty of access to. But in recent years, prices have increased significantly, which has forced many companies to reduce production and warn of job cuts.

Marc Filippino
So energy, the cost of energy is a major problem. What else is driving the manufacturing decline in Germany?

Patricia Nilsson
It’s been a triple whammy in a way. First, you had the pandemic and the sort of general consumer malaise. People are not buying as much as they used to. You had the inflation, but most significantly, German industry has for — the past couple of years and even decades — been very reliant on China as a market. And this is changing. The Chinese market that the German companies had access to before has really turned into a Chinese rival, especially car companies. You see a lot of EV start-ups coming into the German car manufacturers’ whole market.

Marc Filippino
OK. So there are high energy prices. China is eating Germany’s lunch when it comes to manufacturing. What are German politicians promising to do about this ahead of Sunday’s election?

Patricia Nilsson
So Friedrich Merz, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union, is polling as the frontrunner to become Germany’s next chancellor. He has promised broadly to cut taxes and reduce energy costs and slash bureaucracy. Two Christian Democrats are currently polling at around 30 per cent. What has been happening over the past couple of weeks, however, is that immigration has become a huge point of discussion. Alternative for Germany, which is currently polling at over 20 per cent, is very anti-immigration. And of course it is impossible to ignore that Germany was the growth engine. And when things started going a bit worse a couple of years ago, it is noticeable that that has coincided with the rise of support for a party that portrays itself as being an alternative to what Germany had before.

Marc Filippino
OK, so immigration is on a lot of voters’ minds, especially the ones who support the AfD. But voters are also worried about manufacturing jobs like we’ve been talking about. Patricia, I guess, regardless of who gets voted in, what happens if they cannot turn things around for the German economy?

Patricia Nilsson
Hundreds of thousands of jobs. The industry is in crisis. Germany’s most energy-intensive companies are currently producing about 20 per cent less than before the pandemic. That’s a lot of jobs. That’s a lot of tax revenue. That’s a lot of wealth that is disappearing from Germany. And a lot of people are starting to get worried. Are we going to be as well off in the future as we used to be?

Marc Filippino
That’s the FT’s Patricia Nilsson in Germany. Thanks, Patricia.

Patricia Nilsson

So that’s gone from being two roles to one. So lots of bankers have been reapplying for the jobs and the people who didn’t succeed in getting that job have left. And we’ve seen a whole range of senior-level departures already. We can expect there may be some more to come as this goes on.  Marc Filippino OK. So a lot of cuts are going to happen; could change the complexion of the bank. What are you looking out for when it comes to HSBC going forward?  Kaye Wiggins Yes. One risk when banks do these kind of wide ranging dramatic restructurings is you can end up losing some of the better people that you might actually have wanted to keep and as they start looking for roles elsewhere because there seems to be a lot of uncertainty. One way they could get around that is by paying them higher bonuses if they stay. So it’s quite interesting in the results that we see that the bonus pool hasn’t been reduced. So you have to assume from that that there will be more money available to the senior bankers that stay, potentially.  Marc Filippino Kaye Wiggins is the FT’s Asia financial correspondent. Thanks, Kaye.  Kaye Wiggins Thanks.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Marc Filippino The UK’s fight against higher prices just hit another bump in the road. Inflation ticked up to 3 per cent in January. That’s the highest it’s been in 10 months and more than what economists were expecting. The increase was driven by things like the price of food, non-alcoholic drinks, even private schools and airfares. And it’s all complicating the Bank of England’s plan to cut interest rates. The BOE has slashed rates three times since last summer, but analysts now think it’ll have to slow the pace a bit going forward. Traders are still betting on two more quarter point cuts this year, just maybe not at next month’s meeting.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  Germany is holding early federal elections this weekend. If you remember, they were triggered after current Chancellor Olaf Scholz pulled the plug on his coalition late last year and then lost a no-confidence vote. Now, there is a lot of focus on the economy as Germans go to the polls. The country’s industrial heartland has been hit real hard recently. I’ve got the FT’s Frankfurt correspondent Patricia Nilsson with us to talk about it. Hi, Patricia.  Patricia Nilsson Hi, Marc.  Marc Filippino So lay out the situation for me, Patricia. Just how rough has it been for German manufacturing in recent years?  Patricia Nilsson So if you look at employment figures, Germany has lost nearly a quarter of a million manufacturing jobs since the start of the pandemic. A lot of Germany’s largest industries have been hit pretty badly. For example, Germany’s car industry. BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen are all selling fewer cars and struggling with high costs when it comes to the transition to electric vehicles. But Germany also has a lot of energy-intensive industries such as chemicals or a steel industry, for example. And these types of companies are really reliant on cheap energy, which before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, they had plenty of access to. But in recent years, prices have increased significantly, which has forced many companies to reduce production and warn of job cuts.  Marc Filippino So energy, the cost of energy is a major problem. What else is driving the manufacturing decline in Germany?  Patricia Nilsson It’s been a triple whammy in a way. First, you had the pandemic and the sort of general consumer malaise. People are not buying as much as they used to. You had the inflation, but most significantly, German industry has for — the past couple of years and even decades — been very reliant on China as a market. And this is changing. The Chinese market that the German companies had access to before has really turned into a Chinese rival, especially car companies. You see a lot of EV start-ups coming into the German car manufacturers’ whole market.  Marc Filippino OK. So there are high energy prices. China is eating Germany’s lunch when it comes to manufacturing. What are German politicians promising to do about this ahead of Sunday’s election?  Patricia Nilsson So Friedrich Merz, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union, is polling as the frontrunner to become Germany’s next chancellor. He has promised broadly to cut taxes and reduce energy costs and slash bureaucracy. Two Christian Democrats are currently polling at around 30 per cent. What has been happening over the past couple of weeks, however, is that immigration has become a huge point of discussion. Alternative for Germany, which is currently polling at over 20 per cent, is very anti-immigration. And of course it is impossible to ignore that Germany was the growth engine. And when things started going a bit worse a couple of years ago, it is noticeable that that has coincided with the rise of support for a party that portrays itself as being an alternative to what Germany had before.  Marc Filippino OK, so immigration is on a lot of voters’ minds, especially the ones who support the AfD. But voters are also worried about manufacturing jobs like we’ve been talking about. Patricia, I guess, regardless of who gets voted in, what happens if they cannot turn things around for the German economy?  Patricia Nilsson Hundreds of thousands of jobs. The industry is in crisis. Germany’s most energy-intensive companies are currently producing about 20 per cent less than before the pandemic. That’s a lot of jobs. That’s a lot of tax revenue. That’s a lot of wealth that is disappearing from Germany. And a lot of people are starting to get worried. Are we going to be as well off in the future as we used to be?  Marc Filippino That’s the FT’s Patricia Nilsson in Germany. Thanks, Patricia.  Patricia Nilsson Thank you.

Marc Filippino
Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Wednesday, February 19th. And this is your FT News Briefing. The US and Russia held talks yesterday to end the war in Ukraine. And Donald Trump has a plan for Ukraine’s rare earth minerals.

Christopher Miller
So it’s actually an offer for Trump to take everything and give very little of anything in return.

Marc Filippino
Plus, investors are having a big reaction to many nuclear reactors. I’m Marc Filippino, and here’s the news you need to start your day.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

The US and Russia are making moves to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. Senior officials from both countries met yesterday in Saudi Arabia. It was their first time meeting since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was not invited to the talks. The US and Russia agreed to quickly normalise relations and, quote, lay the groundwork for future co-operation on finding a peace deal. Both sides said that a deal could involve some kind of economic or investment component. Zelenskyy has said Kyiv will reject any deal it didn’t have a hand in. European leaders are scrambling to respond. French President Emmanuel Macron is planning an emergency meeting between them today. It’s the second so far this week.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is after Ukraine’s rare and precious metals. His administration is floating a plan that would give the US a stake in the country’s vast natural resources, but it raises some questions. My colleague, Chris Miller, has been looking into this from Kyiv. He joins me now. Hi, Chris.

Christopher Miller
Hi, Marc.

Marc Filippino
All right. So let’s start with what minerals does Ukraine have that Trump is so interested in?

Christopher Miller
Sure. Well, Ukraine actually has quite a few minerals. These include things like lithium, graphite, cobalt, titanium. So titanium, for example, is used for missiles, planes, ship production. Ukraine is also rich in coal. So these are all things that can be used in American production facilities, for example, and have attracted the Trump administration.

Marc Filippino
Yeah, and how did Trump even get wind of these minerals? How did he find out?

Christopher Miller
Yeah it’s interesting, actually. You know, one of his allies, Lindsey Graham, the senator from South Carolina, first turned both Trump on to this idea and the Ukrainians on to the idea that it might be something that attracts Trump. And so last summer, the Ukrainians started drafting what President Zelenskyy calls his victory plan. And when he came to the United States in September of last year, he met with Donald Trump in New York, and he presented this victory plan to him. And one of those points was this idea of swapping American military assistance for access to Ukraine’s rare and critical minerals. That was something that Trump really liked. And when he was elected in November, the Ukrainians started discussing how they could present that to him in a way in which they could secure future military assistance from the United States under the Trump administration.

Marc Filippino
OK, so there’s very clearly this thing that the Trump administration wants from Ukraine. What is Trump offering Ukraine in return?

Christopher Miller
Yeah, and it turns out actually not very much. Trump has said that he would like to recoup around $500bn that he thinks is owed to the United States for past support for Ukraine’s defences. Ukrainian officials that I spoke to over the weekend were telling me, you know, that actually this deal that they offered us, it is a document that lays out that Ukraine is to give roughly 50 per cent of all of its rare and critical minerals that could be mined and future earnings to the United States in return for this military assistance that was already given to Ukraine under the Biden administration. So it’s actually an offer for Trump to take everything and give very little of anything in return. And for the Ukrainians, that’s just not an option.

Marc Filippino
Chris, I guess I’m just wondering, though, how feasible is this plan to begin with? This is a country at war, obviously. So, is it gonna be hard to get these projects off the ground and actually extract these minerals that we’re talking about?

Christopher Miller
Well, according to experts and Ukrainian officials, it’s going to be really difficult and time consuming and very costly. They don’t expect these minerals to be extracted for many years, if not decades. There are some open mines that are in production here in Ukraine, but many of them have been occupied by Russian forces over the last three or 10 years when Russia’s invasion first began. Many of the others are still really sitting there in deposits under the earth. So this is a really difficult and very timely and costly process that we’re talking about.

Marc Filippino
Chris, to what extent do you think a deal would be good for Ukraine?

Christopher Miller
Well, the deal, as is, is not good for Ukraine. And Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been very vocal about that. So one of the things that the Zelenskyy team has told me is that they’re trying to renegotiate this offer and trying to tie directly into the agreement future American military assistance. And actually, some people here in Kyiv and some Western officials have said the Ukrainians might have made a mistake in offering this too quickly and without enough thought. They say that Zelenskyy should have been a bit more specific about what he was willing to give up to the Americans in exchange for military assistance.

Marc Filippino
That’s the FT’s Chris Miller in Ukraine. Thanks, Chris.

Christopher Miller
Thanks, Marc.

Marc Filippino
Developers of small nuclear reactors are enjoying something of an investment boom. They’ve raised over $1.5bn in the past year as money pours in from big tech and elsewhere. Jamie Smyth is the FT’s US energy editor, and he’s been totalling up the figures. Hi, Jamie.

Jamie Smyth
Hello, Marc.

Marc Filippino
All right. So, Jamie, what’s been going on in this space?

Jamie Smyth
So, Marc, yeah. When I first started covering the small modular reactor sector about a year and a half ago, we were actually in a bit of a funding drought for these companies — high inflation, high interest rates was really hitting the sector quite hard. But what we’ve seen over the past year is there’s been this flow of money back into these new technologies. So in total, we’ve got about $1.5bn raised from this new type of development over the past 12 months.

Marc Filippino
Let’s back up for a second. What exactly are mini nuclear reactors, these SMRs, and why all the interest?

Jamie Smyth
So SMRs stand for small modular reactors. They’re a new class of smaller, more compact nuclear reactors that use nuclear fission to generate heat and power. Typically, they generate about a third of the power produced by one of the standard full-scale nuclear power plants. Now they’re really growing in popularity because they can be made more cheaply and with less risk than the massive nuclear reactors that have typically been built over the last several decades.

Marc Filippino
So clearly, there’s an appeal there. What would a revival in the nuclear sector due to the larger main energy sector?

Jamie Smyth
Well, at the minute, in the US, nuclear provides about 18 to 20 per cent of the electricity into the energy mix. What we’re seeing is that the electricity demand in the US is really surging at the minute, in particular because of the rollout of internet data centres to power this artificial intelligence boom. So SMRs are seen as a key way to plug that gap. You know, one of the big drivers for the increased funding into SMRs is that last October, Google signed a power supply deal with Kairos Power, and Amazon signed a big power supply deal with X-energy. These two deals really demonstrated, I think, that the big tech companies really see nuclear as a viable way to supply them with power to fuel this artificial intelligence boom.

Marc Filippino
Jamie, this sounds all well and good, but I have to assume that there might be some risks to this kind of investment.

Jamie Smyth
Exactly. SMRs are really a first of a kind technology deployment. Now that brings with it huge tactical and regulatory risks. So, a lot of these are innovative technologies. Some of them might not work, for example. Also, regulators, particularly with nuclear energy, they’ve got to be very careful. This can delay deployment of these types of technologies. Then separately, despite this increase in funding that we’re seeing over the last year, these technologies still rely a lot on government investment. So the Biden administration offered co-development grants to Ex-energy and TerraPower of over $1bn each. Also, the IRA, Biden’s flagship climate law, provided production tax breaks of up to 50 per cent for these SMRs. Now Trump, although he does seem to be a fan of nuclear power, has taken issue with the amount of money going towards the IRA. So there is a risk that Trump could cut the funding for these types of projects and that would obviously have a devastating impact on their rollout.

Marc Filippino
Jamie Smith is the FT’s US energy editor. Thanks so much, Jamie.

Jamie Smyth
Thanks, Marc.

The conversation also highlighted Donald Trump's interest in Ukraine's rare earth minerals like lithium and titanium, crucial for military applications. Trump's plan involves exchanging military assistance for access to these resources, but Ukrainian officials see the proposal as one-sided, demanding significant concessions for minimal support from the US.

Lulu Smyth
Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Monday, February 17th. And this is your FT News Briefing. Ukraine’s allies gather for an emergency meeting in Paris. And Europe’s banking sector is on a hot streak. Plus, a new BP investor is making a big splash in the oil industry.

Sujeet Indap voice clip
They have become mythical, legendary and when they call on a company, everybody pays attention.

Lulu Smyth
I’m Lulu Smyth. And here’s the news you need to start your day.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

European leaders will gather in Paris today to craft a response to the situation in Ukraine. The meeting comes as the US and Russia have begun discussing ways to end the war but without input from either Ukraine or Europe. French President Emmanuel Macron will host officials from countries like the UK, Germany and Poland. They’ll talk about defence spending and how best to support Ukraine going forward. As for the US and Russia, they’ll begin formal peace negotiations in Saudi Arabia in the coming days.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

The darling of markets over the last few years has been the Magnificent Seven. It’s a group of seven tech stocks that has basically propped up the S&P 500. But what if I told you that the Mag Seven isn’t the only magnificent game around? Say hello to the Magnificent 47 in Europe. The FT’s Nicholas Megaw is here to explain what you’ve been missing. Hey, Nick!

Nicholas Megaw
Hiya!

Lulu Smyth
OK, so first, what is the Magnificent 47?

Nicholas Megaw
So the actual group we’re talking about is the Stoxx 600 banks index. The Stoxx 600 is like a Europe-wide equivalent of the S&P 500. And then there’s a sub-index of that, which is just the banks who are in that group. 47 is not a specific choice, it’s just how many banks happen to be in there. You’ve got kind of the big British ones like HSBC and then also kind of BNP Paribas in France, Deutsche Bank in Germany. And after having a very rough decade and a half after the financial crisis, they’ve actually been doing really well in the last three years. If you count dividends, the total returns since the start of 2022 have been around 100 per cent, which is even more than the Mag Seven has managed.

Lulu Smyth
But then walk me through this, If the Stoxx 600 banks index is doing so well, then why hasn’t it got more attention?

Nicholas Megaw
So this stat has been kind of doing the rounds amongst bank analysts and bank investors over the past few weeks. I think the person on the street is less likely to have noticed because we’re starting from such a terribly low base. You know, one of the reasons the Mag Seven got so famous is that they’re so big. It was moving the entire global stock market. European banks are just much smaller than that, so they have less of a wider knock-on impact.

There is also a timing factor. It’s a really cute chart to compare them since the start of 2022. But it kind of only works if you do it since the start of 2022, because that was the year when interest rates started going up and that hit tech stocks. So they dropped for a while. If you move the starting point forward to 2023, it doesn’t work so well. If you go further back in time, it really doesn’t work. So if you look since 2015, the bank’s return is still around 100 per cent, whereas tech stocks go up to 2,600 per cent.

Lulu Smyth
Right. So depending on when you track performance matters. But do you think this current rally, starting from 2020, will continue?

Nicholas Megaw
It is a good question. I mean, I would be really shocked if it managed to keep up this kind of blistering pace because as we said, it was starting from a really low base and it’s done a good chunk of the catching up now. But if you take a really long-term view or compare the European banks with American banks or companies in the rest of the world, it’s still not at crazy high levels. So there could still be some scope for it to continue for a while.

Lulu Smyth
And what sort of lessons does the performance of the Stoxx 600 banks index leave for investors who have obviously loved the Mag Seven returns?

Nicholas Megaw
So I think it’s an interesting reminder that there are other opportunities around outside of the real mega-cap companies. The issue is it is easier for me to point this out now after kind of three years of this rally. The challenge for any investor is noticing it, ideally, at the beginning. I don’t think banks will ever be quite as exciting as the big tech groups. But it is still a reminder that, like, there is more than one game in town.

The hedge fund Elliott Management has been making some splashy moves lately. It’s built stakes in BP and Phillips 66, and is playing the role of activist investor. So what are these investments tell us about Elliott’s strategy? Here to explain is the FT’s Wall Street editor Sujeet Indap. Hi, Sujeet.

Sujeet Indap
Hi. Good to be here.

Lulu Smyth
Tell me a little bit about Elliot’s involvement in BP and Phillips. How much of a stake has the hedge fund built and what is it looking to change?

Sujeet Indap
Sure. So Phillips 66, and BP are obviously energy companies, although in different parts of the energy ecosystem. Elliott’s taken roughly a 5 per cent stake in each — in BP, it’s about £4bn, in Phillips, it’s about $2.5bn. And in both instances, they are seeking the management board to make operational changes, which they think will boost the stock price. In the case of BP, it’s obviously the national champion oil company in the UK. It has sprawling operations across the world. A few years ago, with the advent of ESG investing, firms like BP tried to expand into green energy. That’s been relatively expensive. It’s hurt at least short-term investment returns. And Elliott simply wants BP to be much more disciplined about that. Phillips at a high level is very similar, they want more streamlined operations. So that is the conceit of activist investors like Elliott. They take a small-ish stake but try to enact big change by being loud and public and rallying support from other investors.

Lulu Smyth
Right. So what does this tell us about Elliott’s investment strategy?

Sujeet Indap
Elliott is a very big firm now. And what that means is for it to actually generate returns for its own investors, it is going after large targets like BP, like Philips, like Starbucks, like Southwest Airlines, where they can take relatively large stakes and make — in dollar amounts — relatively high returns that ultimately move the needle for their investors.

And they have such a fearsome, if not respected image now, that when they take a stake in a company, the company has to take them seriously. Other investors have to take them seriously. They seem to be able to effect change in a way most other activist investors cannot. So they are the giant of this industry. They have become mythical, legendary and when they call on a company, everybody pays attention.

Lulu Smyth
OK. But hedge funds do this sort of thing all the time, right? So what’s Elliott doing differently?

Sujeet Indap
Elliott is increasingly going after blue chips in all the companies we’ve heard of. And what that means is those big companies typically which could repel or even ignore an activist investor who can only get a 1 or 2 per cent stake and were not particularly influential, Elliott can go after any company in the world. And when they put out a paper or a press release or a website, it forces all other investors to take them seriously. And they are for sure will able to effect change. So there is no company that is safe from an Elliott campaign, no matter how big you may think they are. And that is relatively unprecedented. And one of the biggest stories in capital markets today.

Lulu Smyth
How a company is handling this idea that they could be subject to an activist move from Elliott no matter how big they are?

Sujeet Indap
So because of Elliott and some other firms like it, there are corporate lawyers and investment bankers who have a whole practice around activist defence and shareholder engagement. And what they do is they go to companies and CEOs and boards of directors and say, hey, on these five dimensions or ten dimensions, you could be subject to an attack from Elliott. And by the way, if you are not prepared for that and the first time you start to do any work on this is after you get their letter or their phone call, then you’re already dead.

So there’s a whole set of work that advisers do with companies to be prepared for when Elliott shows up. Certainly, any firm that has CEO transition or has underperformed its peers or has done a bad acquisition or has wasted money and capital expenditures, they are absolutely ripe for an Elliott engagement. And Elliott is constantly screening for targets.

Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Monday, February 17th. And this is your FT News Briefing. Ukraine’s allies gather for an emergency meeting in Paris. And Europe’s banking sector is on a hot streak. Plus, a new BP investor is making a big splash in the oil industry. Sujeet Indap voice clip
They have become mythical, legendary and when they call on a company, everybody pays attention. Lulu Smyth
I’m Lulu Smyth. And here’s the news you need to start your day. [MUSIC PLAYING] European leaders will gather in Paris today to craft a response to the situation in Ukraine. The meeting comes as the US and Russia have begun discussing ways to end the war but without input from either Ukraine or Europe. French President Emmanuel Macron will host officials from countries like the UK, Germany and Poland. They’ll talk about defence spending and how best to support Ukraine going forward. As for the US and Russia, they’ll begin formal peace negotiations in Saudi Arabia in the coming days. [MUSIC PLAYING] The darling of markets over the last few years has been the Magnificent Seven. It’s a group of seven tech stocks that has basically propped up the S&P 500. But what if I told you that the Mag Seven isn’t the only magnificent game around? Say hello to the Magnificent 47 in Europe. The FT’s Nicholas Megaw is here to explain what you’ve been missing. Hey, Nick! Nicholas Megaw
Hiya! Lulu Smyth
OK, so first, what is the Magnificent 47? Nicholas Megaw
So the actual group we’re talking about is the Stoxx 600 banks index. The Stoxx 600 is like a Europe-wide equivalent of the S&P 500. And then there’s a sub-index of that, which is just the banks who are in that group. 47 is not a specific choice, it’s just how many banks happen to be in there. You’ve got kind of the big British ones like HSBC and then also kind of BNP Paribas in France, Deutsche Bank in Germany. And after having a very rough decade and a half after the financial crisis, they’ve actually been doing really well in the last three years. If you count dividends, the total returns since the start of 2022 have been around 100 per cent, which is even more than the Mag Seven has managed. Lulu Smyth
But then walk me through this, If the Stoxx 600 banks index is doing so well, then why hasn’t it got more attention? Nicholas Megaw
So this stat has been kind of doing the rounds amongst bank analysts and bank investors over the past few weeks. I think the person on the street is less likely to have noticed because we’re starting from such a terribly low base. You know, one of the reasons the Mag Seven got so famous is that they’re so big. It was moving the entire global stock market. European banks are just much smaller than that, so they have less of a wider knock-on impact. There is also a timing factor. It’s a really cute chart to compare them since the start of 2022. But it kind of only works if you do it since the start of 2022, because that was the year when interest rates started going up and that hit tech stocks. So they dropped for a while. If you move the starting point forward to 2023, it doesn’t work so well. If you go further back in time, it really doesn’t work. So if you look since 2015, the bank’s return is still around 100 per cent, whereas tech stocks go up to 2,600 per cent. Lulu Smyth
Right. So depending on when you track performance matters. But do you think this current rally, starting from 2020, will continue? Nicholas Megaw
It is a good question. I mean, I would be really shocked if it managed to keep up this kind of blistering pace because as we said, it was starting from a really low base and it’s done a good chunk of the catching up now. But if you take a really long-term view or compare the European banks with American banks or companies in the rest of the world, it’s still not at crazy high levels. So there could still be some scope for it to continue for a while. Lulu Smyth

Marc Filippino
US President Donald Trump is ready to bring peace to Ukraine and he says he will work, quote, very closely with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin to make it happen. But there is a problem. He won’t commit any US money or troops.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

This is Swamp Notes, the weekly podcast from the FT News Briefing, where we talk about all of the things happening in US politics. I’m Marc Filipino, and this week we’re asking: what happens if Trump goes it alone in trying to settle the Ukraine conflict? Here with me to discuss is Max Seddon. He covers Russia for the FT. Hi, Max.

Max Seddon
Hi.

Marc Filippino
We’ve also got Keir Giles, a senior fellow at Chatham House and the author of a new book called Who Will Defend Europe?: An Awakened Russia and a Sleeping Continent. Hi, Keir.

Keir Giles
Hello, Marc.

Marc Filippino
So, Max, why don’t you catch us up? On Wednesday, Donald Trump had a 90-minute call with Vladimir Putin, and when he finished, he wrote on Truth Social, the social media network, that negotiations on Ukraine would begin immediately. What do we know about this phone call and what signal does it send for these peace talks?

Max Seddon
Well, Donald Trump, in the course of these 90 minutes, basically threw three years of western policy on supporting Ukraine against the Russian invasion out of the window. Under former President Joe Biden, the motto everybody was working under was: nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. And the idea was very much that Ukraine’s allies in the US and Europe had a joint strategy that they would work on together on bringing Russia to the table. And Trump essentially dispensed of that and revealed the view that I think is much closer to Putin’s view of this, which is this is not a question of Russia invading a sovereign country. This is about talks between two great powers. He didn’t inform Ukraine or any European countries about the call in advance. And the message that the administration has been sending this week is very much that we will agree to some sort of deal, and we will present it to Ukraine at some point and it will be Europe that has to deal with the longer-term consequences of whatever this arrangement may be.

Marc Filippino
Keir, the conversation that we’re talking about between President Trump and President Vladimir Putin got a lot of negative response, especially from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but also a lot of European officials. Why were they mad?

Keir Giles
Yes. And of course, it’s not just Ukraine and Europe. It’s actually the United States’ partners and allies around the world that are looking at this aghast. And to understand that, you have to factor in not just what President Donald Trump has said, but also the more or less simultaneous remarks by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. Trump has said in fairly vague terms that there’s gonna be immediate talks on peace, but it was Hegseth that laid out what appears to have been pre-emptive concessions to Russia that have already been agreed even before those talks actually start.

No Nato membership for Ukraine, no support for Ukraine’s future security from the United States — even if there is a European peacekeeping force — and no hope of regaining Ukrainian territorial sovereignty — explicitly ruling out the return to the 2014 borders. So it’s the combination of these two efforts. It’s the combination of Trump talking to Putin over the heads, not just of the Ukrainians but of all of the other countries that this will directly affect. And, of course, what the United States appears already to have given up to Putin before that process even starts, that has got everybody distinctly concerned.

Marc Filippino
This is a lot for Europe to swallow, but this seems like even more for Ukraine to deal with and accept. Max, can you give us a sense of what this might look like from Kyiv? What kind of peace talks does it want and why are some of those, you know, hard-line positions Putin repeated on Wednesday unacceptable to it?

Max Seddon
Well, if you look at what Putin has said, his position hasn’t really changed since the start of the war. Russia is sticking to these very hard line demands, which are . . . essentially what they add up to is that Ukraine, you know, if this happens, will cease to exist as a functional state because it won’t be able to have a strong military. It will have to agree to surrender not just territory already occupied by Russia, but even some other territory that Russia has not occupied at any point during the war. And what this all adds up to is Ukraine either becoming some sort of vassal state as part of Russia or just being so weak that Russia could eventually conquer it again if they so chose. And this has left Ukraine basically on the outside looking in to the point where Zelenskyy had to say, I’m not gonna be able to accept any peace deal that is just imposed on us without our input.

Marc Filippino
Why would Putin do this? I mean, he’s saying things and suggesting things that are clearly unacceptable to Ukraine. Is this a way of just bargaining? You know, you start high and then, you know, the other side brings you down. What is the plan here?

Max Seddon
I think the plan is very much about using this openness to Trump to help bring Russia back in from the cold as it were. Because if you look at the Kremlin readout of the call, one of the things that they discussed, as well as the war in Ukraine, the Iranian nuclear program, they even talked about things like artificial intelligence and bilateral economic co-operation, a thing that does not really currently exist because of all the sanctions that the US and its allies have imposed because of the war, and would presumably have to be lifted before there were any meaningful economic co-operation.

And this is something that Putin can use not just to get a seat back at the table of nations, but what he is essentially proposing is sphere of influence for Russia, much like the way it carved out Europe with the United States and the UK at the Yalta Conference at the end of World War 2. And they have demanded Nato essentially roll back all of its deployments east of the Iron Curtain has made in the past 25 years. So I think with Putin, this is something that secures not just his aims during the war, but this really is about things that he’s wanted for a very long time and it would really secure his political legacy.

Marc Filippino
You know, I think there’s a lot of discussion about Europe having, you know, basically control over its own fate when it comes to security. Right now, this weekend, there’s the Munich Security Conference where a lot of these things are being hashed out. So we could hear more shortly. But, you know, Keir, you write a lot about European denialism and the sense that Europe would like to have a more reduced role in its own security. And I wonder if that era is over. I mean, are European leaders thinking that maybe after all they will have to be more responsible for the defence of Europe?

Keir Giles
You would like to think that finally that realisation has hit home. But the problem is we’ve been here so many times before. That alarm call has sounded so many times before, and European leaders have hit the snooze button on it. And for so long there’s been the cosy expectation that these ambitions of Vladimir Putin were unrealistic. And so, of course, they were right up until the point where you have an incoming US administration that says, OK, Russia, all of that sounds good to us. We will force that through on the Ukrainians and the Europeans on your behalf. And now suddenly you have panic in Europe again, because western European leaders in particular are once again confronted with the results of their own delinquency.

It is not Trump’s fault, it’s not any US administration’s fault that western Europe has taken so little interest in defending itself while it’s been sheltering under the American security blanket. And now that after a period where that blanket has been gradually edged away, suddenly it’s being ripped off, it’s exposing the consequences of those decisions. And so Europe, of course, faces calculations of how much it will cost to defend itself that are vastly greater than if they’d simply maintained defence capability, or even started building it up a decade ago when the need became clear. So we’ll see if — not just over the next coming days in Munich, but also in general over the weeks and months to follow — if this will finally give the impetus to Europe to start looking to protecting itself instead of outsourcing defence to the United States.

Marc Filippino
Max, what happens if Europe isn’t able to get it together quickly and Trump pushes forward? I imagine there’s a lot of fear in Ukraine on this, and could Russia, you know, use that to its advantage?

Max Seddon
I think Russia certainly could, but I would also emphasise that this is likely going to be a lot more difficult than maybe even Trump necessarily realises at the moment. There are a lot of things that they’ve already stated as policy, but de facto, they can’t really change without the consent of Nato allies. And likewise they’re going to find that any kind of sustainable deal is going to require at least some level of Ukrainian buy-in.

I think the danger is more that we don’t know exactly how serious Putin is about negotiating an end to this war at all. It appears that Trump very much wants to get it out of the way, but there is much less indication that Putin is interested in this at all because right now they’re winning the war. They have more men on the front than Ukraine. They are sustaining enormous casualties but they are more or less able to sustain their numbers at the front. And if they don’t get everything they want, then there isn’t necessarily that much reason for them to stop. And I think that would be the biggest danger here and something that the US could potentially be underestimating.

Marc Filippino
Yeah. Why quit while you’re ahead? How do both of you guys see this playing out? Putin and Trump have said they may meet in Saudi Arabia. What else are key moments we should be looking out for?

Keir Giles
I think, first of all, let’s look very closely at how Russia is responding to this, as Max suggested, a much more muted response, specifically on what Trump appears to have offered in the phone call with Putin. But that, of course, is reflective of the fact that so much has already been conceded before the process even starts. So Russia is in a position where it may well feel that it can push for more from the United States.

Marc Filippino
Max, what about you? What are your thoughts?

Max Seddon
I think the first indication will be who is appointed from the Russian side to be the counterparts in these talks, because the last time there were any kind of serious talks with Ukraine at the very beginning of the war, the delegation mostly consisted of these pretty mid-ranking officials who were all so distant from the actual war-fighting process that it wasn’t clear to a lot of people involved the extent to which they even really had Putin’s buy-in for negotiations. We know that there have been talks going on throughout the war with the US on things like prisoner exchanges, and that has involved much more senior officials than the people who are involved in the peace delegation. And the degree of their direct involvement with the US, I think, would be a major selling point about how serious Putin is, because ultimately this is only up to him.

You know, we only need to remember the last time Trump was in office and made all sorts of rapturous noises about wanting to be friends with Russia, the spectacle of their summit with Putin in Helsinki, where he basically said he trusted Putin more than he did his own intelligence officials. But what was the result of that? And I’ve had a few people on the Russian side say this to me in the last few months is that it all ended in total disaster. And by the time that Trump left office, US policy towards Russia was more hostile. And it happened when he came in. So I think there is still a lot to be done, regardless of how eager Trump may be to get this agreed.

Marc Filippino

No Nato membership for Ukraine, no support for Ukraine’s future security from the United States — even if there is a European peacekeeping force — and no hope of regaining Ukrainian territorial sovereignty — explicitly ruling out the return to the 2014 borders. So it’s the combination of these two efforts. It’s the combination of Trump talking to Putin over the heads, not just of the Ukrainians but of all of the other countries that this will directly affect. And, of course, what the United States appears already to have given up to Putin before that process even starts, that has got everybody distinctly concerned. Marc Filippino
This is a lot for Europe to swallow, but this seems like even more for Ukraine to deal with and accept. Max, can you give us a sense of what this might look like from Kyiv? What kind of peace talks does it want and why are some of those, you know, hard-line positions Putin repeated on Wednesday unacceptable to it? Max Seddon
Well, if you look at what Putin has said, his position hasn’t really changed since the start of the war. Russia is sticking to these very hard line demands, which are . . . essentially what they add up to is that Ukraine, you know, if this happens, will cease to exist as a functional state because it won’t be able to have a strong military. It will have to agree to surrender not just territory already occupied by Russia, but even some other territory that Russia has not occupied at any point during the war. And what this all adds up to is Ukraine either becoming some sort of vassal state as part of Russia or just being so weak that Russia could eventually conquer it again if they so chose. And this has left Ukraine basically on the outside looking in to the point where Zelenskyy had to say, I’m not gonna be able to accept any peace deal that is just imposed on us without our input. Marc Filippino
Why would Putin do this? I mean, he’s saying things and suggesting things that are clearly unacceptable to Ukraine. Is this a way of just bargaining? You know, you start high and then, you know, the other side brings you down. What is the plan here? Max Seddon I think the plan is very much about using this openness to Trump to help bring Russia back in from the cold as it were. Because if you look at the Kremlin readout of the call, one of the things that they discussed, as well as the war in Ukraine, the Iranian nuclear program, they even talked about things like artificial intelligence and bilateral economic co-operation, a thing that does not really currently exist because of all the sanctions that the US and its allies have imposed because of the war, and would presumably have to be lifted before there were any meaningful economic co-operation.  And this is something that Putin can use not just to get a seat back at the table of nations, but what he is essentially proposing is sphere of influence for Russia, much like the way it carved out Europe with the United States and the UK at the Yalta Conference at the end of World War 2. And they have demanded Nato essentially roll back all of its deployments east of the Iron Curtain has made in the past 25 years. So I think with Putin, this is something that secures not just his aims during the war, but this really is about things that he’s wanted for a very long time and it would really secure his political legacy. Marc Filippino
You know, I think there’s a lot of discussion about Europe having, you know, basically control over its own fate when it comes to security. Right now, this weekend, there’s the Munich Security Conference where a lot of these things are being hashed out. So we could hear more shortly. But, you know, Keir, you write a lot about European denialism and the sense that Europe would like to have a more reduced role in its own security. And I wonder if that era is over. I mean, are European leaders thinking that maybe after all they will have to be more responsible for the defence of Europe? Keir Giles You would like to think that finally that realisation has hit home. But the problem is we’ve been here so many times before. That alarm call has sounded so many times before, and European leaders have hit the snooze button on it. And for so long there’s been the cosy expectation that these ambitions of Vladimir Putin were unrealistic. And so, of course, they were right up until the point where you have an incoming US administration that says, OK, Russia, all of that sounds good to us. We will force that through on the Ukrainians and the Europeans on your behalf. And now suddenly you have panic in Europe again, because western European leaders in particular are once again confronted with the results of their own delinquency.  It is not Trump’s fault, it’s not any US administration’s fault that western Europe has taken so little interest in defending itself while it’s been sheltering under the American security blanket. And now that after a period where that blanket has been gradually edged away, suddenly it’s being ripped off, it’s exposing the consequences of those decisions. And so Europe, of course, faces calculations of how much it will cost to defend itself that are vastly greater than if they’d simply maintained defence capability, or even started building it up a decade ago when the need became clear. So we’ll see if — not just over the next coming days in Munich, but also in general over the weeks and months to follow — if this will finally give the impetus to Europe to start looking to protecting itself instead of outsourcing defence to the United States. Marc Filippino
Max, what happens if Europe isn’t able to get it together quickly and Trump pushes forward? I imagine there’s a lot of fear in Ukraine on this, and could Russia, you know, use that to its advantage? Max Seddon I think Russia certainly could, but I would also emphasise that this is likely going to be a lot more difficult than maybe even Trump necessarily realises at the moment. There are a lot of things that they’ve already stated as policy, but de facto, they can’t really change without the consent of Nato allies. And likewise they’re going to find that any kind of sustainable deal is going to require at least some level of Ukrainian buy-in.  I think the danger is more that we don’t know exactly how serious Putin is about negotiating an end to this war at all. It appears that Trump very much wants to get it out of the way, but there is much less indication that Putin is interested in this at all because right now they’re winning the war. They have more men on the front than Ukraine. They are sustaining enormous casualties but they are more or less able to sustain their numbers at the front. And if they don’t get everything they want, then there isn’t necessarily that much reason for them to stop. And I think that would be the biggest danger here and something that the US could potentially be underestimating. Marc Filippino
Yeah. Why quit while you’re ahead? How do both of you guys see this playing out? Putin and Trump have said they may meet in Saudi Arabia. What else are key moments we should be looking out for? Keir Giles
I think, first of all, let’s look very closely at how Russia is responding to this, as Max suggested, a much more muted response, specifically on what Trump appears to have offered in the phone call with Putin. But that, of course, is reflective of the fact that so much has already been conceded before the process even starts. So Russia is in a position where it may well feel that it can push for more from the United States. Marc Filippino
Max, what about you? What are your thoughts? Max Seddon I think the first indication will be who is appointed from the Russian side to be the counterparts in these talks, because the last time there were any kind of serious talks with Ukraine at the very beginning of the war, the delegation mostly consisted of these pretty mid-ranking officials who were all so distant from the actual war-fighting process that it wasn’t clear to a lot of people involved the extent to which they even really had Putin’s buy-in for negotiations. We know that there have been talks going on throughout the war with the US on things like prisoner exchanges, and that has involved much more senior officials than the people who are involved in the peace delegation. And the degree of their direct involvement with the US, I think, would be a major selling point about how serious Putin is, because ultimately this is only up to him.  You know, we only need to remember the last time Trump was in office and made all sorts of rapturous noises about wanting to be friends with Russia, the spectacle of their summit with Putin in Helsinki, where he basically said he trusted Putin more than he did his own intelligence officials. But what was the result of that? And I’ve had a few people on the Russian side say this to me in the last few months is that it all ended in total disaster. And by the time that Trump left office, US policy towards Russia was more hostile. And it happened when he came in. So I think there is still a lot to be done, regardless of how eager Trump may be to get this agreed. Marc Filippino

Check back next week for more US political analysis from the Financial Times.",2025-02-14,This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode,"In a recent FT News Briefing podcast, analysts discuss former US President Donald Trump's approach to negotiating peace in Ukraine. Trump has expressed a willingness to work closely with Russian President Vladimir Putin but has refused to commit any US funds or troops to the effort.

Trump's recent 90-minute call with Putin indicated a shift away from the previous US and European strategy of working collaboratively with Ukraine. Instead, Trump suggests that the US would propose a peace deal to Ukraine after negotiating with Russia, which has caused alarm among Ukrainian and European leaders. Key concessions to Russia were hinted at, including no NATO membership for Ukraine and no military support from the US, making the situation more concerning for Ukraine's long-term sovereignty.

Both analysts emphasized that Putin's demands could undermine Ukraine's status as a functioning state, raising fears of a potentially weakened Ukraine or even its absorption into Russia. The challenge for Europe is whether it can step up its own defense efforts rather than relying on US support, especially amidst concerns that Trump may proceed with negotiations that could ignore Ukraine's needs.

Looking ahead, the response from Russia and the appointment of senior officials for negotiations will be critical in assessing the potential for a sustainable peace deal. Analysts warn of uncertainty regarding whether Putin genuinely seeks to negotiate, given Russia’s current military positioning in the conflict."

Marc Filippino
Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Friday, February 14th, and this is your FT News Briefing.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Arm is causing a stir with a new chip project and Shein might have to pump the brakes on going public. Plus the online brokerage firm Robinhood finally has a feather in its cap.

Jennifer Hughes
So from what looked like a fintech start-up in 2021, it’s different now. It looks like it’s grown up.

Marc Filippino
I’m Marc Filippino and here’s the news you need to start your day.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Arm will launch its own chip this year after securing Meta as one of its first customers. The move by the chip designer could upend the balance of a $700bn industry. I’m joined now by Tim Bradshaw, our global tech correspondent who helped break this story. Hi, Tim.

Tim Bradshaw
Hey, Marc.

Marc Filippino
All right, Tim. So can you remind us exactly what Arm does now and how the move into chip manufacturing will essentially change its business model?

Tim Bradshaw
So Arm is in many ways the most ubiquitous tech company that you’ve may never have really heard of because they operate behind the scenes. They make the blueprints, the designs that go into the chips that are made by companies like Apple and Nvidia and the iPhone or the GPUs that power AI. And they have always been kind of Switzerland in the tech industry. They have had to work with lots of companies that compete fiercely with each other. They had to kind of balance that very delicately. And they license their intellectual property to everybody. And moving into making their own chip brings them into competition with their own customers, who just happens to be some of the world’s most valuable companies.

Marc Filippino
Yeah. So what does it mean that companies like Meta are looking to buy chips from Arm?

Tim Bradshaw
So if we go back 20, 30 years, the number of companies that could design chips was pretty small. And since Apple showed the world what you could do when you design your own chips for your own products, basically every tech company with the resources to do it has started trying to design their own chips, too. And so we’ve seen Microsoft, Amazon, Google, especially, all move into designing their own chips, especially for the data centres, these huge server systems that are becoming ever more energy intensive as we move into the AI era. And so Arm’s designs are already ubiquitous in a lot of these data centres and it is now trying to help those companies that do not have the resources to develop their own chips by selling them a finished product. And Meta is the first customer that we have learned for this for Arm. But we expect there will be many more.

Marc Filippino
How could Arm’s announcement affect the AI and semiconductor industry more broadly.

Tim Bradshaw
By moving into territory that competes with its own customers. Could do one of two things. It could start to really supercharge its revenues because it’s suddenly selling a full chip rather than just getting a sliver of royalty for each one that sold. And it kind of goes from being a behind-the-scenes player in the chip industry to being one of the main actors, or it terrifies all of its Big Tech customers who have pretty deep pockets at this point. And they say, well, it’ll be hard to replicate Arm’s technology, but if they’re going to compete with us, well, we can make that investment. And they kind of risk scaring off all of those very big customers. So it’s pretty high stakes stuff, not just for Arm, but also for the kinds of investments that all of these Big Tech companies are going to be making in chips the next five or 10 years.

Marc Filippino
Tim Bradshaw is the FT’s global technology correspondent. Thanks so much Tim.

Tim Bradshaw
Thank you.

Marc Filippino
Arm share price jumped on yesterday’s news and ended the day up more than 6 per cent.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Shein is thinking about putting its plans for an initial public offering on hold. There have been whispers that the Chinese fast fashion company plans to go public in the UK as soon as the end of April. But sources told the FT that US President Donald Trump’s crackdown on free imports might push that IPO back to later in the year. The repeal of de minimis rules would mean that shipments worth less than $800 would start getting hit with tariffs. That’s a huge deal for Shein, which sends a lot of those kinds of products to the US. The de minimis repeal is in pause mode right now, but sources say Shein is still concerned about the impact it could have on its IPO. Shein was valued at £66bn during its most recent funding round in 2023, and it could add a lot of shine to London’s somewhat lacklustre capital markets.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

It wasn’t that long ago that Robinhood was kind of considered a joke. The online broker and trading platform was the home of the 2021 meme stock craze. You guys remember GameStop? The point is that Robinhood was the place where amateur investors trolled the markets. But now Robinhood seems to be all grown up as the FT’s US markets editor, Jen Hughes, is here to tell me. Hey Jen.

Jennifer Hughes
Hey there.

Marc Filippino
So give me a quick sense of just how big of a turnaround we’ve seen from Robinhood. What’s its story?

Jennifer Hughes
Well, you put the first part of the story there already, the meme stock mania when people were stuck at home. It was the pandemic. Everyone had stimulus checks to spend and not much else to do. That was the peak for Robinhood back in the day. Then we had what I kind of called the wilderness years. It did its own IPO. It went public itself, but its shares absolutely tanked. They were down something like 80 per cent to the next year because people went back to work. Trading volumes dropped off and it kind of went away from people’s consciousness. But a lot has changed in the last year and it’s really riding high at the moment.

Marc Filippino
Yeah, it sounds like just a real rollercoaster ride. Give me a sense of how well it’s doing now.

Jennifer Hughes
Well, the shares are up more than 400 per cent in the last year. They’re well back past their IPO price above that now. It just announced blowout fourth quarter numbers at its first full calendar year of net profitability. So from what looked like a fintech start-up in 2021, it looks like it’s grown up.

Marc Filippino
What is behind all this newfound success? How did Robinhood do it?

Jennifer Hughes
Some of it is down to the market mood. We’ve had this sort of crypto trading period since the US election in November. This is a sense that the Trump administration is going to come out with a regulatory framework for crypto and then the whole market can go mainstream because it would be safer for mom-and-pop investors and for everyone to get into. But at the same time, Robinhood has been steadily building out new products. It did a credit card last year. More recently, they added futures trading. They now have this cool desktop product with serious charting capabilities. That’s for, like, the more active traders. So when people have looked at Robinhood, they’re looking again now like we are. It’s very different.

Marc Filippino
It’s for a more maybe mature investor or is it just got more mature products?

Jennifer Hughes
Yeah, a more mature investor. It won’t just be the millennials trading on it. It will also be perhaps mom and pop. But also those millennials are a couple of years older. They’re a little bit wealthier, and they’ve got a few more reasons to stick around. Now it’s trying to do other things, so it’s trying to offer retirement products, savings products. So it’s working towards being a one-stop shop for financial services. It’s got a huge way to go before it looks like a Fidelity or a Schwab or something of that size. But that’s kind of the pathway.

Marc Filippino
Yeah. I was actually going to ask you about that. Do you think that Robinhood’s success is sustainable or is this a blip?

Jennifer Hughes
That’s putting a reporter on the spot.

Marc Filippino
Sorry, Jen. (laughter)

Jennifer Hughes
(Laughter) But honestly, I have to say yes. Mostly it is sustainable. By that I mean that the longer-term trends are there in its favour. There really is this sort of new army of retail traders. Not everybody stopped when they went back to work after the pandemic. And what’s got a lot of the analysts excited this time is the idea that if we get this regulatory framework that everyone expects at some point around crypto, then the market in the US gets so much bigger. And if Robinhood can keep up with these guys and offer them more and more, it should grow.

Marc Filippino
Jen Hughes covers US financial markets for the FT. Thanks, Jen.

Jennifer Hughes
Thank you.

Donald Trump brought the world one step closer to a global trade war yesterday. He ordered his advisers to come up with reciprocal tariffs to retaliate against countries that imposed taxes and levies on the US. The measures will happen on a country-by-country basis, according to a senior White House official. Up first are the ones that the US has the biggest trade deficits with, like China, the European Union and Mexico. The official also said the reciprocal tariffs could take effect in a matter of a few weeks or months.

",2025-02-13,This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode,"In this Financial Times news briefing, key updates include:

1. **Arm's Chip Manufacturing**: Arm, a company that designs chip blueprints for major tech firms, is shifting to producing its own chips, starting with Meta as a customer. This could disrupt the $700 billion semiconductor industry by increasing Arm's revenues and potentially unsettling its big tech customers.

2. **Shein's IPO Delays**: The Chinese fast fashion brand Shein might postpone its initial public offering (IPO) due to uncertainties surrounding potential tariffs from U.S. policy changes. These tariffs could significantly impact Shein's business model, as it relies on shipping low-value goods to the U.S.

3. **Robinhood's Turnaround**: After struggling post-IPO, online brokerage Robinhood has seen its shares rise over 400% in the past year and reported its first year of profitability. This resurgence is attributed to a favorable market atmosphere and broadened services, appealing to a more diverse range of investors, beyond just millennials.

Marc Filippino
Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Thursday, February 13th. And this is your FT News Briefing. Europe is getting the cold shoulder when it comes to Ukraine’s peace negotiations. And US inflation is on the upswing. Plus, a Chinese chip company is eating South Korea’s lunch. I’m Marc Filippino. And here’s the news you need to start your day.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

European countries are trying to figure out what US President Donald Trump wants from a Ukraine peace deal. They’re hoping to get more clarity at the Munich Security Conference that starts tomorrow. Here to talk about what might be in store for a peace deal is the FT’s Brussels bureau chief, Henry Foy. Hi, Henry.

Henry Foy
Hey, Marc.

Marc Filippino
All right Henry, so EU countries don’t actually know a ton about what the Trump administration is working on in terms of a peace deal between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But what do they know?

Henry Foy
They know that whatever is being cooked up and whatever Donald Trump is landing on is probably going to have to be paid for by European capitals. And when I say paid for, Marc, what I mean is putting in cash up front to pay for reconstruction, building roads, building housing and pay for it with physical humans, with troops. Donald Trump has made very clear that there will not be US troops in Ukraine after the war to keep the peace. Now, the real concern here is that Europe is going to be asked to pay for and support a deal that they have zero input into striking. And what they’re very worried about is that Trump is going to sort of . . . presented to them as a fait accompli and then go and negotiate it with Putin and possibly Zelenskyy, but not necessarily over the heads of Europe.

Marc Filippino
Now, Trump said yesterday that he had spoken to Putin on the phone and that the two of them would actually begin negotiations, quote, immediately. What else did the Trump administration say?

Henry Foy
Well, for a while, Trump has been saying that Europe needs to take on more responsibility for its own defence. That sort of morphed in recent days into Europe needs to take more responsibility for Ukraine going forward. Also this week, we also had the release of the US citizen Marc Fogel in Russia. This was a prison swap deal negotiated by one of Trump’s associates in Moscow. Europeans, of course, very happy to see a Western citizen go free from a Russian jail. But for them, they read it as, OK, Putin is in a dealmaking mood and Trump is ready to do deals. And again, this is another deal that the Europeans were not involved in at all.

Marc Filippino
And how is the EU responding to being left out?

Henry Foy
So they’re doing their best to sort of reach out to the Trump administration. They’re doing it bilaterally through capitals. I’m thinking of Giorgia Meloni in Rome or perhaps Viktor Orbán in Hungary are reaching out bilaterally to the Trump administration, trying to get as much information as they can, and then sharing that with the European allies. They’re also trying to huddle here in Europe and working out what the contingency plan might be, and really how to make sure they lobby as hard as they can at Munich this week. And in any conversations they end up having with Trump officials such as JD Vance, the vice-president, trying in any way they can to influence Trump’s thinking and try to make sure that he’s taking European thoughts into account.

Marc Filippino
Henry, what kind of impact would a Trump-led peace agreement, that doesn’t really involve the EU, have on European security?

Henry Foy
Well, Marc, I think if Trump were to say this is the deal that I’ve negotiated with Vladimir Putin, and this is the deal you’re all gonna have to agree to, that would really make a lot of European capitals question just how much they’re able to A: rely upon the United States in the future for any kind of security guarantees to European states. But also, if on top of that, European troops are being made to move into Ukraine by Donald Trump to protect this peace agreement that he’s negotiated, what then happens if Russia were to launch an attack in Ukraine? Would America come to their aid? It really does open up a huge number of questions about how Europe sees its future and how much it can rely on America. If it’s told you’re not allowed to be part of this deal. But I need you to pay for it, execute it, and make sure it holds.

Marc Filippino
Henry Foy is the FT’s Brussels bureau chief. Thanks, Henry.

Henry Foy
Cheers, Marc.

US inflation unexpectedly ticked up last month. It’s now at 3 per cent. Economists had predicted it would stay steady at 2.9 per cent, though the price of eggs was a major factor. Prices rose 15 per cent in January and 53 per cent over the past year, partly because of a surge in bird flu cases. The increase makes it more likely that the Federal Reserve will move slowly on cutting interest rates. Last month, the central bank left rates unchanged. Higher inflation has left investors less than optimistic about rate cuts. They had priced in two for this year before the data was released. Now they’re thinking there will only be one.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

DeepSeek isn’t the only Chinese technology company making headlines these days. The chipmaker CXMT could be just as disruptive. It’s been gobbling up global market share. And this time, South Korea is paying the price. Here to explain is Christian Davies. He’s our Seoul bureau chief. Hi, Christian.

Christian Davies
Hello.

Marc Filippino
So the CXMT produces these things called memory chips. Christian, what do they do and what does the market for them look like?

Christian Davies
So there are basically two main types of semiconductor. There are the logic chips. These are processors that do the thinking and are memory chips which store information in the processors. Memory is heavily commoditised, meaning that you have a much smaller number of players who are competing to produce products on price rather than technological sophistication. At the moment, the market is dominated by Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix from South Korea and Micron from the US. But CXMT, in just the last few years, has gone from effectively 0 to 5 per cent and maybe soon 10 per cent market share. That doesn’t sound like very much. But in a heavily commoditised market, even small shifts in market share make a big difference.

Marc Filippino
And how exactly is CXMT increasing its market share?

Christian Davies
What we are seeing with CXMT is replicating a pattern we’ve seen in several other industries, which is Chinese newcomers starting at the low-end of the market. And gradually, as they accumulate market share, moving further and further up the value chain to produce more and more sophisticated products. And this has often come at the expense of Korean companies who themselves had built their position in those sectors by taking over from their Japanese rivals. And now we’re starting to see Chinese companies do the same thing to the Koreans.

Marc Filippino
OK so, South Korean companies are facing a serious challenger in CXMT, is there anything that could slow it down?

Christian Davies
So at the moment, you’re starting to see a lot of government intervention, specifically the United States intervening to try and prevent Chinese companies from taking over the top end of the market. They’ve been imposing export controls, for example, stopping CXMT and other Chinese chip companies from accessing sophisticated chipmaking equipment. So at the moment, although CXMT has been rapidly rising at the lower end of the market, there is still a kind of technical ceiling that is certainly decelerating or hampering their efforts to catch up at the high end of the market with the Koreans.

Marc Filippino
So these export controls are really putting pressure on CXMT. What does that tell us about the future of chipmaking, not only in South Korea, but, you know, China too?

Christian Davies
South Korea’s saving grace is that it’s not Chinese. As long as the United States is determined not to depend on Chinese semiconductors, then they’re going to need non-Chinese rivals. And that’s where the South Koreans have a clear advantage. But what normally happens is export controls are imposed. They tend to have flaws. They tend to have loopholes, and only by observing them in practice for two or three years, then the US government can see where the loopholes and the gaps are. What we can say is that we’ve seen how adept China is at progressing and really making do with what it can in order to make rapid progress.

1. **Ukraine Peace Talks**: European countries are uncertain about U.S. President Donald Trump's plans for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, particularly as they expect to pay for reconstruction and security without having influenced the negotiations. Trump is negotiating directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin, leaving European nations concerned about their role and reliance on the U.S. for security.

2. **U.S. Inflation**: U.S. inflation has unexpectedly risen to 3%, higher than the predicted 2.9%. This increase, partly driven by soaring egg prices due to bird flu, makes it less likely for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, impacting market sentiments about future rate adjustments.

3. **Chinese Chipmaker CXMT**: The Chinese semiconductor company CXMT is rapidly increasing its market share in memory chips, competing against South Korean giants Samsung and SK Hynix. This growth is following a pattern where Chinese companies start at lower market segments and move up. However, U.S. export controls on chipmaking technology could slow CXMT's progress in more advanced areas.

Overall, these developments indicate shifting dynamics in European security relations, U.S. economic concerns, and the competitive landscape of the semiconductor industry."

Marc Filippino
Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Wednesday, February 12th. And this is your FT News Briefing. Hong Kong’s tech stocks are soaring right now. And Elon Musk is throwing a wrench in OpenAI’s plans to restructure. Plus, Sudan’s two-year civil war has entered a new phase. I’m Marc Filippino, and here’s the news you need to start your day.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Tech companies are having a stellar week on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Chinese tech stocks listed there have entered bull market territory. The index that tracks the 30 largest companies is up 27 per cent since about a month ago. Investors are excited because of a Chinese AI start-up that we’ve been talking about a lot lately — DeepSeek. Its model uses way less computing power than its US counterparts. And on top of that, the world’s largest electric vehicle battery maker, CATL, applied for a secondary listing there this week. It could be the city’s largest stock offering in years.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Elon Musk wants to take control of the non-profit that governs OpenAI. He led a consortium of investors this week to make a nearly $100bn offer for it. That could complicate an already complicated restructuring at OpenAI. So why would Musk offer an absurd amount of money for a non-profit? Well, there’s some history there. I’m joined now by the FT’s venture capital correspondent, George Hammond. Hi, George.

George Hammond
Hey.

Marc Filippino
All right. So can you break down for us what OpenAI’s structure is? What exactly Musk in this group of investors offered?

George Hammond
So OpenAI has a really complex structure, and that’s a legacy of its foundation as a non-profit research organisation in 2015. The company then launched a capped for-profit subsidiary in 2019, so it could start taking in outside investment. So it has this slightly Frankenstein structure of a non-profit which has a controlling stake in a for-profit entity. And what OpenAI is trying to do is to streamline its structure and make itself into a more traditional for-profit structure. So Musk is offering $97.4bn with a consortium of other investors to take control of those assets held by the non-profit, which include control over the for-profit.

Marc Filippino
So do we think this bid is going anywhere, George?

George Hammond
OpenAI have made it pretty clear they’re not interested in this bid. Chief executive Sam Altman has said publicly that OpenAI is not for sale and OpenAI’s mission is not for sale. According to our sources, the board of OpenAI has not received a formal bid, and they’ve been pretty unequivocal that they would not consider selling to an external investor.

Marc Filippino
Just out of curiosity, why is Musk doing this? Why even float this kind of offer?

George Hammond
I think there’s a few ways to look at this. Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI. He left OpenAI’s board in 2018 after clashing with Altman about the direction of the company. And since then, he’s become a competitor to OpenAI. He’s launched his own AI start-up, xAI. So there is a competitive dynamic here and a business dynamic. You could also take him at his word and think that he is committed to OpenAI’s mission, and he thinks Sam Altman and Co reneging on that mission. And so he thinks he’d be a better steward of these assets than they would.

Marc Filippino
How much of a wrench could this throw into Altman’s plan to convert OpenAI to a for-profit company? I have to imagine that there would be several hurdles there.

George Hammond
So Altman is trying to do something phenomenally complicated in turning this company, which was founded as a non-profit into a form of for-profit. And as part of that restructuring, it has to put a value on the assets held by the non-profit. Internally, OpenAI is talking about a valuation of around 30bn. Musk’s bid pushes up the potential valuation of these assets to closer to 100bn, and that puts OpenAI in a position where they may have to pay more to complete this deal, which would give them less to invest in pursuing the technology. So it creates a complication for OpenAI and they think that’s one motivation for Musk’s bid.

Marc Filippino

Marc Filippino
The European Union isn’t gonna take Donald Trump’s tariffs lying down. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Tuesday that the bloc would retaliate against US levies on steel and aluminium imports. EU member states have already approved tariffs of up to 50 per cent on nearly €5bn worth of US imports. They would only need a quick final vote to impose them and then boom, products like bourbon, motorcycles and steel would all get hit. There’s still some time for a deal to shake out, though. Von der Leyen will meet with US vice-president JD Vance today. Trump’s tariffs on the EU aren’t set to take effect until March 12th.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Sudan’s army is getting closer to making a major breakthrough in the country’s civil war. For two years now, the Sudanese armed forces have been locked in a brutal battle with the paramilitary rapid support forces. 10mn people have been displaced, thousands killed, and many more are at risk of starving. But now the army is closing in on Sudan’s capital, Khartoum. Here to explain the conflict is the FT’s William Wallis. Hey, William.

William Wallis
Hi there.

Marc Filippino
OK. So William, the way I understand it is that there are two factions here. You have the Sudanese army, which is the SAF, and then this militia that came out of the Darfur conflict. They’re called the Rapid Support Forces. What’s happening on the ground with this major offensive from the SAF?

William Wallis
Well first of all, this is a very vast country, and they only began to have some military successes towards the autumn last year. But this does seem to be some very significant momentum now, which means that they’ve taken a large part of the capital and they’re now within about 2km from the presidential palace. That’s not to say they’ve won the battle for Khartoum yet, but they’re just a lot closer to what would be a very symbolic victory for them in the last two years.

Marc Filippino
William, what is the fighting done to the people of Sudan?

William Wallis
I think that most humanitarian organisations would say that it’s provoked the most serious humanitarian crisis in the world today, superseding what’s happened in the Middle East and superseding what has happened in Ukraine in terms of the number of people it’s displaced. But probably most worryingly now, after nearly two years of fighting, a very large proportion of the population is now threatened with starvation. Secondly, both sides in this brutal battle have committed appalling atrocities. So ethnic cleansing, rape, being used as a weapon of war, it’s hard to underestimate the impact it’s had on the Sudanese population.

Marc Filippino
Wow. So if the Sudanese army is able to capture the capital, is there a plan for Sudan to rebuild or a way for them to start to heal from this conflict?

William Wallis
Should they take the capital, and they do seem to be confident at this stage. General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the de facto president, is suggesting he’ll name a prime minister and a technocratic government of some sort that would prosecute the war to its . . . what they would hope is its logical conclusion, defeating the RSF and retaking the whole Sudanese territory. However, if they take Khartoum, the country is effectively gonna be split between the army in the east of the country and the RSF forces in the west of the country. So the war as such would be far from over. It could, however, lead to greater international support for the Sudanese army, given that they’ve proved they’re able to retake some of the territory which would allow Sudan to rebuild and would allow greater humanitarian access to all those people who are suffering.

Marc Filippino
Yeah, I’m glad that you brought that up. I’m curious about what it would take to solve the humanitarian crisis in Sudan.

William Wallis
Well, even in the best of times, that’s a difficult problem. This is not the best of times because the whole humanitarian landscape in this region has been slightly upended by US President Donald Trump’s decision to freeze US aid. And that has had big impact on some of the UN agencies and others. So I’m told even that some US food aid is rotting at ports because there’s been such a hold-up just in the last two, three weeks. It’s a very uncertain time given what’s happening in the world at large.

And so he thinks he’d be a better steward of these assets than they would.  Marc Filippino How much of a wrench could this throw into Altman’s plan to convert OpenAI to a for-profit company? I have to imagine that there would be several hurdles there.  George Hammond So Altman is trying to do something phenomenally complicated in turning this company, which was founded as a non-profit into a form of for-profit. And as part of that restructuring, it has to put a value on the assets held by the non-profit. Internally, OpenAI is talking about a valuation of around 30bn. Musk’s bid pushes up the potential valuation of these assets to closer to 100bn, and that puts OpenAI in a position where they may have to pay more to complete this deal, which would give them less to invest in pursuing the technology. So it creates a complication for OpenAI and they think that’s one motivation for Musk’s bid.  Marc Filippino George Hammond covers venture capital for the FT from San Francisco. Thanks, George.  George Hammond Thanks, Marc.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Marc Filippino The European Union isn’t gonna take Donald Trump’s tariffs lying down. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Tuesday that the bloc would retaliate against US levies on steel and aluminium imports. EU member states have already approved tariffs of up to 50 per cent on nearly €5bn worth of US imports. They would only need a quick final vote to impose them and then boom, products like bourbon, motorcycles and steel would all get hit. There’s still some time for a deal to shake out, though. Von der Leyen will meet with US vice-president JD Vance today. Trump’s tariffs on the EU aren’t set to take effect until March 12th.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Sudan’s army is getting closer to making a major breakthrough in the country’s civil war. For two years now, the Sudanese armed forces have been locked in a brutal battle with the paramilitary rapid support forces. 10mn people have been displaced, thousands killed, and many more are at risk of starving. But now the army is closing in on Sudan’s capital, Khartoum. Here to explain the conflict is the FT’s William Wallis. Hey, William.  William Wallis Hi there.  Marc Filippino OK. So William, the way I understand it is that there are two factions here. You have the Sudanese army, which is the SAF, and then this militia that came out of the Darfur conflict. They’re called the Rapid Support Forces. What’s happening on the ground with this major offensive from the SAF?  William Wallis Well first of all, this is a very vast country, and they only began to have some military successes towards the autumn last year. But this does seem to be some very significant momentum now, which means that they’ve taken a large part of the capital and they’re now within about 2km from the presidential palace. That’s not to say they’ve won the battle for Khartoum yet, but they’re just a lot closer to what would be a very symbolic victory for them in the last two years.  Marc Filippino William, what is the fighting done to the people of Sudan?  William Wallis I think that most humanitarian organisations would say that it’s provoked the most serious humanitarian crisis in the world today, superseding what’s happened in the Middle East and superseding what has happened in Ukraine in terms of the number of people it’s displaced. But probably most worryingly now, after nearly two years of fighting, a very large proportion of the population is now threatened with starvation. Secondly, both sides in this brutal battle have committed appalling atrocities. So ethnic cleansing, rape, being used as a weapon of war, it’s hard to underestimate the impact it’s had on the Sudanese population.  Marc Filippino Wow. So if the Sudanese army is able to capture the capital, is there a plan for Sudan to rebuild or a way for them to start to heal from this conflict?  William Wallis Should they take the capital, and they do seem to be confident at this stage. General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the de facto president, is suggesting he’ll name a prime minister and a technocratic government of some sort that would prosecute the war to its . . . what they would hope is its logical conclusion, defeating the RSF and retaking the whole Sudanese territory. However, if they take Khartoum, the country is effectively gonna be split between the army in the east of the country and the RSF forces in the west of the country. So the war as such would be far from over. It could, however, lead to greater international support for the Sudanese army, given that they’ve proved they’re able to retake some of the territory which would allow Sudan to rebuild and would allow greater humanitarian access to all those people who are suffering.  Marc Filippino Yeah, I’m glad that you brought that up. I’m curious about what it would take to solve the humanitarian crisis in Sudan.  William Wallis Well, even in the best of times, that’s a difficult problem. This is not the best of times because the whole humanitarian landscape in this region has been slightly upended by US President Donald Trump’s decision to freeze US aid. And that has had big impact on some of the UN agencies and others. So I’m told even that some US food aid is rotting at ports because there’s been such a hold-up just in the last two, three weeks. It’s a very uncertain time given what’s happening in the world at large.  Marc Filippino William Wallis is the FT’s east and Central Africa correspondent. Thanks so much, William.

1. **Hong Kong Tech Surge**: Hong Kong's tech stocks, particularly Chinese companies, are experiencing a significant rise, with a 27% increase in the index tracking the 30 largest companies due to excitement around an AI start-up called DeepSeek and a potential large stock offering from CATL, the world’s largest electric vehicle battery maker.

OpenAI has a complicated structure consisting of a non-profit that holds a majority stake in a for-profit subsidiary. However, OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, stated that the organization is not for sale, complicating Musk's intentions, which may stem from a belief he could better uphold OpenAI's original mission.

Marc Filippino
Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Tuesday, February 11th and this is your FT News Briefing. PwC China is seeing partners head towards the door and Donald Trump’s tariffs are giving the world feelings of déjà vu. Plus, Hizbollah is trying to hang on to its followers. 

Malaika Tapper
Hizbollah, at its core, is a vast popular base across Lebanon and without that popular support, the organisation really is nothing. 

Marc Filippino
I’m Marc Filippino and here’s the news you need to start your day. PwC China is still paying the price for its botched Evergrande audit. You might recall that back in September, Chinese authorities hit the firm with a $60mn fine and a six-month ban. Beijing said that PwC concealed and even condoned fraud in its audit of the failed property developer. Since then, the FT has learned that more than five dozen partners have left. Now, it’s not clear if they’ve resigned, but it signals that things are not great over at PwC. The firm has been struggling to keep its client base in the region, which is mostly made up of privately held companies and Hong Kong-listed groups like Alibaba and Tencent.

Donald Trump has his eye on more tariffs, this time for aluminium and steel imports. The news sent US metal prices soaring on Monday, with American traders paying big premiums compared with their European counterparts. Now, if you’re thinking “gee this sounds familiar”, you would be correct. Trump hit most countries with the same thing during his first term in office. So to get a better grasp on what we’re in for this time around, I’m talking with my colleague Andy Bounds in Brussels. Hey, Andy. 

Andy Bounds
Hi. 

Marc Filippino
So take me back to 2018. What were the details of Trump’s tariffs on these metals? And what was he hoping to accomplish? 

Andy Bounds
Well, Marc, as you know, Donald Trump has a thing about steelworkers and aluminium workers and the rust-belt, if you want to call it, of the US, where many of his voters are. And he really wanted to protect that industry from imports and not just cheap imports from China, but also from the EU, from Japan, a lot of his allies around the world. So that’s what happened in 2018. He actually went with 25 per cent for steel and 10 per cent for aluminium last time. Now he’s going for 25 per cent on both. 

Marc Filippino
And in 2018 did imports into the US drop? 

Andy Bounds
They did, actually. There were a lot of exemptions as well because a lot of people that use the metal, like car manufacturers, would say, we need this particular grade and we can’t get it in the US or we need these parts that we can’t get in the US. So there were some exemptions. But nevertheless, the predictable thing happened as any trade economist would tell you, imports went down and therefore prices went up. 

Marc Filippino
Yeah. Break that down for me. So for something like a car manufacturer like you mentioned, how were they impacted? 

Andy Bounds
Yeah. I mean, basically it hit their earnings, especially General Motors and Ford, who relied on this cheaper imported metal to produce their cars. If you increase the raw material cost going into cars, you’re also going to increase the cost of the car at the end. And then they either have to take a hit or charge more to the consumer. 

Marc Filippino
OK. So this is all on the US side. But Andy, how did other countries respond to the imposition of tariffs? 

Andy Bounds
Well, in a pretty predictable way, which is they retaliated with their own tariffs, sometimes on steel and aluminium, but also on sort of classic American products like bourbon whiskey, Harley-Davidson’s, jeans, especially things coming from states where Republican lawmakers were in power and countries were trying to put pressure on those lawmakers to get Trump to change course, which didn’t really actually work very well. But they lost to Trump’s time. And then Biden came in and settled some of these disputes. So, for example, he did a deal with the EU, but, you know, a lot of them remained in place. 

Marc Filippino
I guess what I’m wondering, Andy, is what sort of lessons should we take away from 2018? 

Andy Bounds
Yeah, I think there’s two impacts, right? So one is on the industry itself, prices will rise, so American cars will probably get more expensive or the American car industry could absorb and sell things at a loss. So that’s one thing. Secondly, supply chains do change. So, you know, a lot of Chinese steelmakers started opening capacity in other countries to try and get around the tariffs. You know, Indonesia is now a big steel producer and a lot of that capacity is actually Chinese. And you get collateral damage. So, for example, the bourbon sales to the EU dropped by a third and they’re still feeling the pain. 

Marc Filippino
So in the end, did the 2018 tariffs make US manufacturing more competitive? Did they end up helping the steel workers that Trump was so concerned about? 

Andy Bounds
I think sadly, it was probably just a brief pause, a stay of execution, if you like. But, you know, the travails of the US steel industry against very fierce global competition remain. And you can only sort of wall off the world for a certain period. 

Marc Filippino

Andy Bounds
Thank you.

Hamas says it’s postponing the next release of Israeli hostages. The militant group accused Israel of violating a three-phase ceasefire agreement. Hamas said Israel delayed returning Palestinians to north Gaza and limited humanitarian aid entering the enclave. Israel’s defence minister responded with accusations of his own, saying the delay by Hamas would break the deal. The two sides have been blaming each other for putting the ceasefire at risk. Up until this point, there have been a few delayed hostage releases, adding pressure to the fragile deal. Stage two of the plan is supposed to start in March.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Meanwhile, in Lebanon, Hizbollah is trying to find a path forward. It just suffered its worst defeat ever against Israel. Now, in order to survive, it needs to appeal to its constituency in Lebanon, which is easier said than done. I’m joined now by the FT’s Malaika Tapper to talk more about this. Hi, Malaika.

Malaika Tapper
Hi, Mark.

Marc Filippino
So get me up to speed really quickly on what sort of position Hizbollah is in these days. 

Malaika Tapper
Hizbollah is probably the weakest it has ever been right now. Its military ranks were completely decimated by Israel’s military offensive on Lebanon over the past few months. And its charismatic longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was assassinated at the start of that military escalation. Meanwhile, it is suffering after its key ally, Bashar al-Assad, had his regime toppled in a lightning offensive in neighbouring Syria. It’s also fighting to hold political ground on the domestic level after a series of elections that have left it politically sidelined in the domestic Lebanese scene. 

Marc Filippino
OK. So it sounds like the group is basically trying to rebuild from the rubble. How much support does it have on the ground? 

Malaika Tapper
I think that what’s really important to emphasise is that while on these macro levels, the regional military level and the domestic political level, Hizbollah is incredibly weak right now. On the very local and minute level it is still really powerful and has these extremely strong networks and has very strong welfare institutions that a lot of people, even non-card carrying sort of residents rely on. So, yes, people are still supportive of Hizbollah, but at the same time, Hizbollah has long kept up a bargain with its supporters that when it goes to war with Israel, it will compensate and rebuild after those wars. And right now, we’re in this shaky period between that destruction and that period of rebuilding. And people are waiting to see what Hizbollah is going to do. 

Marc Filippino
Yeah. So tell me a little bit about what that rebuilding program looks like. 

Malaika Tapper
Yeah. Hizbollah right now, what they’re doing, as soon as the war ended, they began this massive effort of deploying hundreds of engineers across the country to assess the damage to people’s homes from the war and kind of calculating a cash amount that they were entitled to from these damages. And then these residents receive cheques from one of Hizbollah’s civilian institutions called the Qard al-Hassan, which is a microfinance institution, and get compensation for the damages. 

Marc Filippino
And how do constituents feel like that’s going so far? 

Malaika Tapper
Some of them were perfectly happy with the amounts that they received. Many others expressed the sense of dissatisfaction with the assessments. They felt like the party was being stingy and was cutting corners with these assessments and giving them less than they were entitled to. And I think that some people linked these, what they saw as small cheques, to the current financial situation of the party, which, you know, is seen to be much weaker than it previously was. Israel targeted Hizbollah’s microfinance institution during the war, and the fall of Assad cut off key supply routes through Syria that the party previously relied on for weapons and money. 

Marc Filippino
And if Hizbollah really isn’t able to satisfy its base, you know, make these payments to help people rebuild their lives, what might that mean for the group long term? 

Malaika Tapper
So while Hizbollah has historically played a really important regional military role and a major role on the domestic political scene, at its core is a vast popular base across Lebanon. And without that popular support, the organisation really is nothing. 

Marc Filippino
Well, Malaika Tapper covers Lebanon for the FT. Thanks, Malaika.

Malaika Tapper
Thank you.

Kasia Broussalian
Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Monday, February 10th. And this is your FT News Briefing.

China has hit the US with new tariffs. And Wall Street dealmakers are starting 2025 off on the wrong foot. Plus, more companies are turning to bitcoin to boost their share prices. I’m Kasia Broussalian, and here’s the news you need to start your day.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Beijing is retaliating against Washington when it comes to trade. China’s embassy in DC said on Sunday that tariffs had gone into effect and will target about $14bn worth of goods. US energy exports and farm equipment will face levies between 10 and 15 per cent. The move is China’s response to President Donald Trump’s tariffs that kicked in last week. Now, markets had been hoping for a deal like the ones that Trump hashed out with the leaders of Canada and Mexico. But it didn’t happen. Trump has said he’s in no rush to negotiate with Chinese President Xi Jinping. And he warned that more measures might be coming.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Wall Street was hoping that 2025 was going to be the year for mergers and acquisitions. Dealmaking had slowed under President Joe Biden, and Donald Trump came into office promising a more business-friendly approach. But so far, M&A has had a rocky start to the year. Here to explain why is James Fontanella-Khan. He’s the FT’s US finance editor. Hey, James. 

James Fontanella-Khan
Hi there. 

Kasia Broussalian
So first of all, just how bad is it for M&A right now? 

James Fontanella-Khan
The decline in M&A was pretty deep in January, especially compared to the last 10 years. On average, we would have around 1,300 deals at the start of the year. There’s some years it’s a bit higher, some years a little lower, but generally above 1,000. The first month of 2025, dealmaking is under 900 deals. And what’s interesting here is that by looking at the actual number of transactions, we get a better sense of how many people are willing to get to the table and get a deal done. And the number is down 30 per cent from last year and it’s the worst start in a decade. 

Kasia Broussalian
All right. But is it really fair to blame President Trump here? I mean, he’s only been in office for a few weeks. 

James Fontanella-Khan
Well, actually, it is. The minute he won the election, every banker on Wall Street, every corporate lawyer on Wall Street was telling us it’s gonna be wild. Everybody who wanted to do a deal and couldn’t do a deal under Joe Biden kind of started reworking on deals that have been put on pause and they were ready to strike. But soon after Trump came into actual power, there was a wave of executive orders. And that kind of really spooked a lot of the chief executives. 

Kasia Broussalian
Well, let’s unpack the hesitancy in dealmaking. I mean, which sectors are being hit the hardest? 

James Fontanella-Khan
So consumer has been hit really hard. Healthcare has been hit really hard, and even energy. And it’s funny because if you look at the energy numbers, on dollar terms, they’re still kind of over . . . last year. But that’s because one single deal, a nearly $30bn transaction involving Constellation and Calpine, has like, kind of skewed the entire data. But if you look again at the number of transactions, that’s down by about 25 per cent. 

Kasia Broussalian
Yeah, that’s a big slump. So what would give Wall Street more confidence right now? 

James Fontanella-Khan
Wall Street wants certainty. Volatility, turmoil — that’s really what kind of spooks anybody trying to get a deal done. And at the moment, we don’t really know. Is inflation gonna be up? Is inflation gonna be down? Are interest rates gonna go up? Are interest rates gonna go down? Are tariffs gonna happen or are tariffs not gonna happen? They just want to know, please take a decision. Stop kind of whiplashing. And that is really what is concerning them. 

Kasia Broussalian
All right. So markets are clearly looking for a little bit more stability. And do you think that this M&A decline will make Trump a little bit more cautious? 

James Fontanella-Khan
It’s very hard to sway or predict what Trump will do. What we do know is that he cares immensely about the stock market going up, and this kind of uncertainty does not help the stock market. And a lot of dealmakers who are sympathetic to the Trumpian cause, who see him as overall a pro-growth president, told me that we need to give him a bit more time. There’s a lot of uncertainty at this stage, but things will settle once we get over the raft of changes and then things might get better. So generally, there is still quite a lot of optimism out there. But as one of my best sources put it to me, he said, like, at the beginning it was all about animal spirits, and now it’s more about cautious optimism.

French President Emmanuel Macron is promising to invest over €100bn into artificial intelligence in France. He made the announcement ahead of the AI Action Summit, which kicks off today in Paris and is meant to signal that the country is serious about being a big player in this cutting-edge technology. Europe has been lagging behind the US and China in development of AI because of a lack of funding and unclear regulations. But Macron is hoping he can turn things around. One investment in France will come from the United Arab Emirates. Last week it said it was going to put in as much as €50bn in a new campus for data centres.

The software service provider Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, is inspiring a lot of copycats these days for what it’s doing with bitcoin, specifically hoarding it. The company started an aggressive crypto-buying spree back in 2020 to increase its share price. And the bet seems to have paid off. Now, Strategy is inspiring a number of other companies to do the same. Nikou Asgari is here to tell me whether there might be a catch. Hey, Nikou. 

Nikou Asgari
Hi. 

Kasia Broussalian
So what’s the back-story to Strategy and its interest in bitcoin? I mean, why did the company start gobbling up all this cryptocurrency? 

Nikou Asgari
So Michael Saylor, the co-founder of the company, started this because he really believes in bitcoin as an asset, as the future of money. And he started buying bitcoin slowly and now much, much more aggressively in a mixture of ways. So they raise equity from the stock market, from shareholders and then use that money to buy bitcoin. And they’ve also started raising debt and various different types of debt and then also use that money to buy bitcoin. They hold now just over 2 per cent of all the bitcoin in the world and are the biggest corporate holder of bitcoin. And as the value of the bitcoin goes up, so does the value of Strategy shares. 

Kasia Broussalian
All right. So what’s the verdict? How has Strategy made out under this approach? 

Nikou Asgari
It’s worked out incredibly well for them. I mean, Strategy as a business, they reported their full-year 2024 earnings last week and they made about $464mn in revenue from the core of the business, the software stuff. But if you look at the share price, the valuation of the company is $84bn, which is crazy. That’s such a huge disparity. And that is really all down to the fact that investors are so happy and investing because of the bitcoin that it holds, not because of the software stuff. 

Kasia Broussalian
And I mentioned that, you know, other companies are starting to copy Strategy’s approach here. What kind of companies are looking into this and why? 

Nikou Asgari
Yeah, there’s a whole handful. So on one side you’ve got bitcoin miners, crypto-specific companies that, you know, obviously believe in bitcoin and as part of their balance sheet, they are adding and holding bitcoin. That’s one thing. But then on the other side and what I think is more interesting is a bunch of companies that have nothing to do with bitcoin. For example, one that I spoke to is KULR Technology. It’s a small-cap US company, and they help people like Nasa and the US Navy manage their thermal energy equipment. They’ve started also doing this. I mean, there’s a bunch of pharmaceutical companies, again, completely unrelated to crypto, their fundamental businesses. But in order to help scare off short sellers maybe who are in the stock, they’ve also started buying this because they see that holding bitcoin has so far helped boost the share prices. 

Kasia Broussalian
But I have to imagine that this being bitcoin, there have to be some concerns here. So what’s the risk to this strategy? 

Nikou Asgari
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the huge overarching risk is if or when, depending on who you speak to, the price of bitcoin collapses, then the value of the company also collapses because really the value of the company is just tied to how much bitcoin they hold. So think about Strategy. I mean, no one really thinks about it as a software business any more or cares about that side of the business. It’s completely evolved into becoming just a huge pile of bitcoin, and that is where shareholders think that the value is. 

Kasia Broussalian
Well, what kind of precedent does crypto hoarding set for companies? I mean, do you think we’re gonna see more of it? 

Nikou Asgari
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I spoke to an investor who is specifically looking to invest in companies doing this, and he said he was knocking on doors of companies that he thought were suitable and, you know, small enough and the share price was the right sort of target to encourage them to do this. And I think obviously we’ve got the overarching, very crypto-friendly US under President Donald Trump at the moment, which just sort of boosts demand for crypto and boosts demand for bitcoin. So I think don’t be surprised if you see more and more companies getting into this.

Today is Monday, February 10th. And this is your FT News Briefing.  China has hit the US with new tariffs. And Wall Street dealmakers are starting 2025 off on the wrong foot. Plus, more companies are turning to bitcoin to boost their share prices. I’m Kasia Broussalian, and here’s the news you need to start your day.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Beijing is retaliating against Washington when it comes to trade. China’s embassy in DC said on Sunday that tariffs had gone into effect and will target about $14bn worth of goods. US energy exports and farm equipment will face levies between 10 and 15 per cent. The move is China’s response to President Donald Trump’s tariffs that kicked in last week. Now, markets had been hoping for a deal like the ones that Trump hashed out with the leaders of Canada and Mexico. But it didn’t happen. Trump has said he’s in no rush to negotiate with Chinese President Xi Jinping. And he warned that more measures might be coming.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Wall Street was hoping that 2025 was going to be the year for mergers and acquisitions. Dealmaking had slowed under President Joe Biden, and Donald Trump came into office promising a more business-friendly approach. But so far, M&A has had a rocky start to the year. Here to explain why is James Fontanella-Khan. He’s the FT’s US finance editor. Hey, James.  James Fontanella-Khan
Hi there.  Kasia Broussalian
So first of all, just how bad is it for M&A right now?  James Fontanella-Khan
The decline in M&A was pretty deep in January, especially compared to the last 10 years. On average, we would have around 1,300 deals at the start of the year. There’s some years it’s a bit higher, some years a little lower, but generally above 1,000. The first month of 2025, dealmaking is under 900 deals. And what’s interesting here is that by looking at the actual number of transactions, we get a better sense of how many people are willing to get to the table and get a deal done. And the number is down 30 per cent from last year and it’s the worst start in a decade.  Kasia Broussalian
All right. But is it really fair to blame President Trump here? I mean, he’s only been in office for a few weeks.  James Fontanella-Khan
Well, actually, it is. The minute he won the election, every banker on Wall Street, every corporate lawyer on Wall Street was telling us it’s gonna be wild. Everybody who wanted to do a deal and couldn’t do a deal under Joe Biden kind of started reworking on deals that have been put on pause and they were ready to strike. But soon after Trump came into actual power, there was a wave of executive orders. And that kind of really spooked a lot of the chief executives.  Kasia Broussalian

Check back tomorrow for the latest business news. ",2025-02-09,This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode,"In a recent Financial Times podcast, key topics include:

1. **US-China Trade Tensions**: China has imposed new tariffs on about $14 billion of US goods, specifically on energy exports and farm equipment, retaliating against tariffs introduced by President Trump. This development impacts market expectations for trade negotiations between the two countries.

2. **Decline in Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)**: Dealmaking on Wall Street has started poorly in 2025, with fewer than 900 deals in January—down 30% from last year and the worst start in a decade. This hesitation is attributed to uncertainty caused by Trump's policies and executive actions, particularly affecting consumer, healthcare, and energy sectors.

3. **Corporate Adoption of Bitcoin**: Strategy, a software company, has gained attention for accumulating significant amounts of bitcoin to enhance its stock value. Other unrelated companies are adopting similar strategies to appeal to investors and potentially increase share prices, though this approach carries risks tied to the volatile bitcoin market.

Overall, the podcast highlights concerns about economic stability and the evolving role of cryptocurrencies in corporate finance."

Marc Filippino
Elon Musk is Washington’s new consultant in chief. He’s been tasked with making the government leaner. And this week, his Department of Government Efficiency made headlines by gaining access to the Treasury department’s payment system, as well as other sensitive government data.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

This is Swamp Notes, the weekly podcast from the FT News Briefing, where we talk about all of the things happening in US politics. I’m Marc Filippino, and this week we’re asking: how far can Elon Musk take his quest to downsize the government? Here with me to discuss is Joe Miller. He covers the intersection of business and government for us in Washington. Hi, Joe.

Joe Miller
Hi, Marc.

Marc Filippino
And we also got Alex Rogers, the FT’s business and politics correspondent, also in Washington. Hi, Alex.

Alex Rogers
Hey, Marc

Marc Filippino
All right. So let’s start with some basics. Elon Musk is officially in Washington as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency or Doge. Like the cryptocurrency, yes. Joe, can you tell me what is Doge and where did it come from?

Joe Miller
To the best of my ability, yes. Marc. Well, Doge is a vehicle that was announced in November for Elon Musk to fulfil his ambition of drastically slashing government spending by . . . he initially floated roughly $2tn a year. It’s unclear or it was unclear what precisely the format of it would be, despite the fact that it’s got ‘department’ in its name. But it does seem to be a branch of the executive office of the White House, which has a bunch of tech CEOs and founders and a lot of young coders embedded in it who are going around key government agencies and essentially auditing them for so-called waste and frivolous spending, and rapidly shutting down various activities and attempting to fire tens of thousands of civil servants.

Marc Filippino
Yeah. Alex, expand on that a little bit for me. What has exactly Doge been up to in its almost three-week existence?

Alex Rogers
Yeah, so Doge has installed itself at the US Treasury, the state and health departments, the Federal Aviation Administration, a host of smaller agencies, and they’re starting to find areas to cut. And so the first victim, if you will, was the entire $40bn agency, USAID, the Agency for International Development, which has effectively been shuttered. He’s going after Health and Human Services. There hasn’t been a heads-up on what they’re going after next. But, you know, by Elon Musk’s Twitter feed, it looks like weapons systems at DOD could be something that they focus on.

Marc Filippino
So more recently, Doge caused an uproar when it got access to Treasury payments data. Joe, what do we know and why are people so upset about that?

Joe Miller
Well, this is perhaps the most sensitive system within the US government. It is more or less the vehicle, the cheque book, if you will, through which government funds are dispersed. And it seems that Doge targeted this early on, because by looking at things as they go out the door, you can sort of go down line by line and item by item and see whether you agree with it or whether you think this is wasteful spending. The problem is that this is, you know, as I mentioned, a very sensitive system. And all of a sudden, two people who were not even named until earlier this week, emissaries from Doge, reportedly had access to it. And Elon Musk was going on X and posting that he was rapidly shutting down illegal payments.

Marc Filippino
Sorry, just let me jump in there for a second. Did these guys get the official clearance to be there? Because my understanding is that these folks didn’t necessarily go through the background checks that you would normally need, right, Alex?

Alex Rogers
Yeah. I talked to Don Hammond, who used to run the federal payment system. And what he told me is that improper access could affect payment integrity and or sensitive data. And so when we’re thinking about the world’s richest man taking on the world’s largest bureaucracy, the question is really who do you trust? And half the country probably loves that Elon Musk is doing what Washington has been unable to do for decades, which is to go after, you know, so-called waste, fraud and abuse. But the issue here is how it’s being done.

Marc Filippino
So it sounds like there’s some murky territory here. Is anything about Doge inherently illegal?

Joe Miller
Well, there have been various lawsuits filed suggesting exactly that, and suggesting that the activities thus far by Doge emissaries have, for example, violated privacy laws and that Doge does not have the authority needed to wield what are essentially executive powers, what you would expect to be wielded by, you know, Senate-approved nominees to various agencies.

One thing that certainly does seem to be controversial or borderline illegal was the attempted impounding of funds that have already been dispersed and the attempt to stop those by the executive. Now that, a couple of judges have already stopped that, and the White House is forced to kind of rescind its order. And so there are some curbs. But in terms of, you know, what Doge is doing, the problem is that it’s happening so fast. And we’re only really hearing about Doge’s activities through leaks and media reports that it’s very hard for campaign groups, for even for Congress and for the courts to keep up.

Alex Rogers
There’s also conflict in messages, right, at the, you know, Elon on Twitter, on the social platform that he owns, saying that they are going after discretionary spending. They are going after government leases. But then you talk to the Treasury department, and they’re saying that Doge representatives only have access to review the payment system, which then doesn’t seem to be exactly true if you’re hearing what Elon’s tweeting about all day, which is why the Treasury department had to write a letter to clarify some of that this week.

Marc Filippino
So what has the reaction been from Congress? Is there a sense that they’re just gonna let this slide? Because this is kind of their ball game here, right?

Alex Rogers
Yeah. I went to the Trump Doral, where the House Republicans were having their retreat to talk about the year ahead. And I would ask members on the Budget Committee or financial services, and nobody really seemed willing to say Congress has the power of the purse here. Everybody seemed like, oh, I mean, this makes sense. You know, these cuts agree with my priorities. Some would occasionally say, you know, these are recommendations. So I think there was this mix when you talk to members of Congress where they’re praising Elon publicly, they don’t wanna have him on their bad side. They agree with, in general, the overarching priorities of trying to cut government spending. But I do think that once you start hitting some of these other programs in the US, especially, then we’re gonna see a bigger fight.

Joe Miller
I think what’s also interesting is that, you know, Musk has a far more effective propaganda machine than members of Congress could ever dream of having. And you’ve seen as he’s going through these various departments, especially when it comes to USAID, that he has simultaneously been flooding the zone with examples of what he sees as, you know, egregious spending, you know. People, even who are loyalists to USAID, and to these particular departments, will agree that there are some areas where there’s been, you know, frivolous spending, etc. But Musk has been incredibly effective at, you know, posting this stuff and saying, you know, isn’t this ridiculous?

And to most normal people, you know, this could be a very effective message. And he says, you know, why should your tax dollars be paying for this research? One of his favourite examples is a shrimp on a treadmill, which is an extract from a piece of research . . . 

[MARC AND JOE LAUGH]

 . . . which I won’t go into. But the point being, these things sound ridiculous when they’re taken out of context. And it’s very hard for members of Congress to at least, you know, thus far to stand up and say, no, no, no, no, we support that, you know, particular budget item because Musk is so effective at ridiculing it.

Marc Filippino
So, guys, last question here. It sounds like Doge kind of has free rein unless somebody steps in. Is there anything that can kind of get in its way right now?

Joe Miller
Well, there’s one thing for certain, and that is Donald Trump. And we’ve seen this week that after Musk dominated the headlines for days in a row, something we know that Trump is not particularly fond of, Trump told reporters that there are limits to Musk’s power and said that he’s running things by the White House. But he said Elon can’t do and won’t do anything without our approval. And he also hinted that the White House had already vetoed some of the more radical suggestions that Doge has floated.

And then there’s also the others within the Trump orbit who have competing priorities. Trump himself has vowed not to touch social security and Medicaid. And, you know, there are many within his orbit who would also stand in the way of those being slashed. And, of course, there are plenty of China hawks who want more money at the Department of Defense rather than less. And so, those are perhaps going to be the more effective curbs on Musk’s power.

Marc Filippino
All right. I wanna thank our guest, Joe Miller. He’s the FT’s Washington correspondent. Thanks, Joe.

Joe Miller

There hasn’t been a heads-up on what they’re going after next. But, you know, by Elon Musk’s Twitter feed, it looks like weapons systems at DOD could be something that they focus on.  Marc Filippino So more recently, Doge caused an uproar when it got access to Treasury payments data. Joe, what do we know and why are people so upset about that?  Joe Miller Well, this is perhaps the most sensitive system within the US government. It is more or less the vehicle, the cheque book, if you will, through which government funds are dispersed. And it seems that Doge targeted this early on, because by looking at things as they go out the door, you can sort of go down line by line and item by item and see whether you agree with it or whether you think this is wasteful spending. The problem is that this is, you know, as I mentioned, a very sensitive system. And all of a sudden, two people who were not even named until earlier this week, emissaries from Doge, reportedly had access to it. And Elon Musk was going on X and posting that he was rapidly shutting down illegal payments.  Marc Filippino Sorry, just let me jump in there for a second. Did these guys get the official clearance to be there? Because my understanding is that these folks didn’t necessarily go through the background checks that you would normally need, right, Alex?  Alex Rogers Yeah. I talked to Don Hammond, who used to run the federal payment system. And what he told me is that improper access could affect payment integrity and or sensitive data. And so when we’re thinking about the world’s richest man taking on the world’s largest bureaucracy, the question is really who do you trust? And half the country probably loves that Elon Musk is doing what Washington has been unable to do for decades, which is to go after, you know, so-called waste, fraud and abuse. But the issue here is how it’s being done.  Marc Filippino So it sounds like there’s some murky territory here. Is anything about Doge inherently illegal?  Joe Miller Well, there have been various lawsuits filed suggesting exactly that, and suggesting that the activities thus far by Doge emissaries have, for example, violated privacy laws and that Doge does not have the authority needed to wield what are essentially executive powers, what you would expect to be wielded by, you know, Senate-approved nominees to various agencies.  One thing that certainly does seem to be controversial or borderline illegal was the attempted impounding of funds that have already been dispersed and the attempt to stop those by the executive. Now that, a couple of judges have already stopped that, and the White House is forced to kind of rescind its order. And so there are some curbs. But in terms of, you know, what Doge is doing, the problem is that it’s happening so fast. And we’re only really hearing about Doge’s activities through leaks and media reports that it’s very hard for campaign groups, for even for Congress and for the courts to keep up.  Alex Rogers There’s also conflict in messages, right, at the, you know, Elon on Twitter, on the social platform that he owns, saying that they are going after discretionary spending. They are going after government leases. But then you talk to the Treasury department, and they’re saying that Doge representatives only have access to review the payment system, which then doesn’t seem to be exactly true if you’re hearing what Elon’s tweeting about all day, which is why the Treasury department had to write a letter to clarify some of that this week.  Marc Filippino So what has the reaction been from Congress? Is there a sense that they’re just gonna let this slide? Because this is kind of their ball game here, right?  Alex Rogers Yeah. I went to the Trump Doral, where the House Republicans were having their retreat to talk about the year ahead. And I would ask members on the Budget Committee or financial services, and nobody really seemed willing to say Congress has the power of the purse here. Everybody seemed like, oh, I mean, this makes sense. You know, these cuts agree with my priorities. Some would occasionally say, you know, these are recommendations. So I think there was this mix when you talk to members of Congress where they’re praising Elon publicly, they don’t wanna have him on their bad side. They agree with, in general, the overarching priorities of trying to cut government spending. But I do think that once you start hitting some of these other programs in the US, especially, then we’re gonna see a bigger fight.  Joe Miller I think what’s also interesting is that, you know, Musk has a far more effective propaganda machine than members of Congress could ever dream of having. And you’ve seen as he’s going through these various departments, especially when it comes to USAID, that he has simultaneously been flooding the zone with examples of what he sees as, you know, egregious spending, you know. People, even who are loyalists to USAID, and to these particular departments, will agree that there are some areas where there’s been, you know, frivolous spending, etc. But Musk has been incredibly effective at, you know, posting this stuff and saying, you know, isn’t this ridiculous?  And to most normal people, you know, this could be a very effective message. And he says, you know, why should your tax dollars be paying for this research? One of his favourite examples is a shrimp on a treadmill, which is an extract from a piece of research . . .   [MARC AND JOE LAUGH]   . . . which I won’t go into. But the point being, these things sound ridiculous when they’re taken out of context. And it’s very hard for members of Congress to at least, you know, thus far to stand up and say, no, no, no, no, we support that, you know, particular budget item because Musk is so effective at ridiculing it.  Marc Filippino So, guys, last question here. It sounds like Doge kind of has free rein unless somebody steps in. Is there anything that can kind of get in its way right now?  Joe Miller Well, there’s one thing for certain, and that is Donald Trump. And we’ve seen this week that after Musk dominated the headlines for days in a row, something we know that Trump is not particularly fond of, Trump told reporters that there are limits to Musk’s power and said that he’s running things by the White House. But he said Elon can’t do and won’t do anything without our approval. And he also hinted that the White House had already vetoed some of the more radical suggestions that Doge has floated.  And then there’s also the others within the Trump orbit who have competing priorities. Trump himself has vowed not to touch social security and Medicaid. And, you know, there are many within his orbit who would also stand in the way of those being slashed. And, of course, there are plenty of China hawks who want more money at the Department of Defense rather than less. And so, those are perhaps going to be the more effective curbs on Musk’s power.  Marc Filippino All right. I wanna thank our guest, Joe Miller. He’s the FT’s Washington correspondent. Thanks, Joe.  Joe Miller Thanks, Marc.

Check back next week for more US political analysis from the Financial Times.",2025-02-07,This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode,"In a recent Financial Times podcast, hosts Marc Filippino, Joe Miller, and Alex Rogers discuss Elon Musk’s new role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, nicknamed ""Doge."" Musk’s initiative aims to cut up to $2 trillion from government spending by prioritizing audits of various federal agencies to identify wasteful expenditures. 

Since its formation, Doge has notably targeted the U.S. Treasury and other agencies, shutting down the $40 billion USAID and potentially focusing on defense budgets. Concerns have arisen due to Doge’s controversial access to sensitive Treasury payment data and possible violations of privacy laws, raising questions about its legitimacy and transparency.

While some members of Congress privately support Musk's goals, there is also apprehension regarding the extent of his powers and the implications of his actions. As Musk's methods provoke mixed reactions, particularly through his social media presence, some political figures, including Donald Trump, hint at tighter oversight on Musk’s initiatives to prevent radical cuts to certain programs like Social Security and defense funding.

Overall, Doge's future influence could be limited by internal political dynamics and public scrutiny of its methods."

Marc Filippino
Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Friday, February 7th. And this is your FT News Briefing.

Amazon is scared of a strong US dollar. And the FT’s Katie Martin tells us how investors might plan for a trade war. 

Katie Martin
It’s this constant experience of feeling like you’re nailing jelly to the wall. 

Marc Filippino
Plus, fighting continues in the Congo over critical minerals. I’m Marc Filippino and here’s the news you need to start your day.

Amazon saw its share price drop as much as 7 per cent in after-hours trading yesterday. The ecommerce giant posted a weaker-than-expected outlook in its quarterly earnings. Amazon said that net sales will top out at $155bn this quarter. That’s well below the expected $158bn. The company anticipates a, quote, unusually large, unfavourable impact from a strong dollar. Amazon web services also posted lower-than-expected sales last quarter. This marks the latest in what has been a mixed tech earnings season. In case you’re wondering, Nvidia reports its fourth-quarter earnings on February 26th.

This week, US President Donald Trump promised a tariff spree on goods coming from Canada, Mexico and China. Only the last ones against China actually stuck. But this was not exactly, shall we say, the most stable trading environment. So how should the markets operate in this climate? We’ve got the FT’s markets columnist Katie Martin to help me answer that. Hi, Katie. 

Katie Martin
Hey, Marc. How are you doing? 

Marc Filippino
I’m good. I’m very relieved and grateful because the pause on tariffs makes it a lot easier to get maple syrup and tequila. And what is life without those things, right? 

Katie Martin
I mean, it’s a worse life. 

Marc Filippino
It’s a much worse life. Absolutely. So take us through it. How did markets respond to the tariff back and forth? 

Katie Martin
I mean, I think, you know, the market knew that he was going to ratchet up tariffs against China. But the Canada and Mexico thing, I think a lot of investors have been thinking really like these are friends and allies of yours. Are you really going to tariff them? And a lot of the commentary over the weekend on social media was, wow, markets are really not going to like this. And actually, what happened when markets opened on Monday was, you know, there was a reaction. So stocks fell and the dollar rose a bit, which you would expect as a result of tariffs that you might assume are going to be inflationary. But the reaction was not that violent. 

Marc Filippino
How much of a sell-off would we have had to see in order for maybe the president to take the markets seriously, that they were really upset about these tariffs because the S&P 500 fell 1.4 per cent, I think it was. 

Katie Martin
Something like that, at the open. So one of the big kind of catchphrases, if you like, that has been kicking around since Trump got elected is, well, he won’t do anything too destabilising with economic policy because he likes to see stock markets going up. And so the stock market acts as what you call like a vigilante. Long talked about bond vigilantes. And now there’s this new phrase kicking around stocks vigilantes. So Trump is very focused on stock index levels. And the idea is that if markets really recoil in horror at something that he says or does, then that might give him reason to backtrack. Now, 1.4 per cent on the S&P 500 is just not enough to do that. So my strong sense is that if stocks had opened like 5 per cent lower, then I think that would be enough to make him think, ooh, I’ve overstepped the mark here, maybe I should backtrack. 

Marc Filippino
So then, Katie, why weren’t investors bugging out more about the chaos? 

Katie Martin
So there was the idea among investors that either he’s bluffing, he’s not going to do this at all, or if he does bring in the tariffs, they won’t last long because you’re going to find, for example, auto manufacturers in the US start to suffer from tariffs with Canada and Mexico pretty quickly. And that’s obviously not the outcome that he’s looking for. It’s very difficult for investors to know, is this going to stick? Is he serious about this? But this example tells you that the market is right to call his bluff. 

Marc Filippino
Investors are kind of in this state of paralysis. Right? So how do markets brace themselves for more tariff uncertainty? I mean, how do you navigate this? 

Katie Martin
I mean, it’s like, you know, how do you get an elephant into a car? Right. With great difficulty. 

Marc Filippino
With its trunk, right? Through the trunk. 

Katie Martin
(Laughter) You’re here all week. You know, this is really hard. So is this constant experience of feeling like you’re nailing jelly to the wall. Like, do I move around my portfolio based on this or do I not? And if I do, am I going to end up losing more money as a result of having done it, when he’s going to change his mind like 24 hours later? It’s really, really hard for investors to deal with. So the safest thing you can do, spread your bets, whether that’s across different asset classes with those like bonds or equities or whatever it is, or different geographies. And one thing that I would say is that, you know, for all the talk that’s out there about American exceptionalism and about how investing in America is the only way forward. Actually, European markets have been doing great. Even UK. So there is a kind of sense that, you know, investors are just trying to avoid putting all their eggs in one basket, which I think makes most sense. 

Marc Filippino
Katie Martin is the FT’s markets columnist. Great talking to you, Katie. 

Katie Martin
And you.

Marc Filippino
The Bank of England lowered its interest rates by a quarter point yesterday. It’s now at 4.5 per cent. All nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee voted for the cut, but a couple wanted to go further and knock a jumbo-sized half-point off rates. That’s because they’re worried about how stagnant the US economy is looking. In fact, the BOE also revised its economic growth forecast on Thursday. The central bank now predicts that it won’t even hit 1 per cent this year. But at least the FTSE 100 was happy. The index hit a record intraday high on the prospect of rate cuts. Two-year gilts also rallied.

A long-simmering conflict is heating up in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In late January, a Rwandan-backed rebel group captured a strategic town in the eastern part of the DRC. Nearly a million Congolese have been displaced because of the recent fighting while thousands have likely been killed. Dino Mahtani is a former FT journalist and a Congo expert. Hey, Dino. 

Dino Mahtani
Hi. Good afternoon. 

Marc Filippino
So give me the lay of the land on this conflict. Who exactly are these rebel fighters and what do they want in eastern DRC? 

Dino Mahtani
So eastern Congo is home to dozens of rebel groups and predatory militia, but the most powerful one is the M23. This group is led by Congolese ethnic Tutsi commanders. They say that they have been fighting to safeguard their ethnic community in eastern Congo, which has for decades been subject to political exclusion, political persecution. And of course, a big part of the international focus has been the role of Rwanda’s army in this conflict. The Rwandan regime is led by Paul Kagame, himself a Tutsi. And so there is that commonality and shared interest between the rebels and Rwanda. 

Marc Filippino
Yeah. What exactly has been Rwanda’s role in backing this M23 rebel group? 

Dino Mahtani
So Congo’s tiny neighbour, Rwanda, which is about 90 times smaller than the giant central African country, has a formidable fighting force. UN investigators say that thousands of Rwandan troops have been part of this M23 resurgence. The Rwandan government publicly denies it. But also, this part of the country is an extremely mineral-rich and resource-rich part of the world. It’s home to vast quantities of minerals on Congolese soil, which many of Rwanda’s critics point to as the primary reason why Rwanda’s involved now. 

Marc Filippino
So, Dino, you mentioned these minerals. What are they used for? Why are they so sought after? 

Dino Mahtani
So Congo’s fabulously rich in terms of natural resources. And the key ones on the ground are tantalum, which is used, for example, in smartphones to improve the audio quality. There are also huge volumes of tungsten, which acts as a kind of heat sink and makes the phones vibrate and tin, which acts as a solder on the circuit boards. There’s also gold in eastern Congo, vast quantities of gold. So these are important minerals which have become, you know, increasingly valuable in tight international commodity markets. 

Marc Filippino
Do we know whether Rwanda has been able to get access to these resources that we’re talking about? 

Dino Mahtani
Yeah. Over the last couple of years, there’s been a constant struggle between Congolese forces and the M23 to control some important mining deposits. And for decades, these minerals have been mined by hand by artisanal miners on the ground. And during the cycles of war and control over territory, these minerals have come under the control of armed groups and have flowed out via Rwanda. There’s even a video clip of President Kagame talking last year where he more or less admits that Rwanda is the major thoroughfare. Congolese finance minister Nicolas Kazadi had said that the country was losing probably about $1bn a year in minerals that were being illegally smuggled into Rwanda. And that figure, if true, is no doubt increasing now that the M23 control this much territory. 

Marc Filippino
Do you know to what extent could the conflict in the DRC destabilise the region more broadly? Is that a concern? 

Dino Mahtani
Yeah, it’s a very deep concern. Congo is at the heart of African stability and is recognised as critical to overall stability on the continent. I mean, in the ‘90s during its civil war, it drew in several of its neighbours from east to west and, you know, anti-western sentiment is very strong at the moment. One of the most popular countries in the minds of Congolese is Russia. And if you’ve seen what’s been going on in other parts of Africa where instability has provoked popular discontent, which has then led to coups and then the advance of Russian mercenaries and militarised interests into the Congo, this is more the type of risks that we are probably looking at. So the west has a real interest in making sure that this conflict doesn’t spin out of control.

The company forecasted net sales of $155 billion for the quarter, less than analysts predicted.

The podcast also discusses President Trump's ongoing tariffs on imported goods, especially from Canada, Mexico, and China, and how these are affecting market sentiment. While the S&P 500 fell 1.4% in response, analysts felt this wasn't enough of a decline to prompt a reconsideration of tariff policies. Investors seem uncertain about the longevity of these tariffs, indicating a cautious approach to market decisions.

Additionally, there’s an update on conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where fighting over valuable minerals has intensified, leading to massive displacement and civilian casualties. The Rwandan-backed M23 rebel group is primarily involved, raising concerns about regional destabilization, especially given the DRC's significant mineral wealth critical for technology production (e.g., tantalum, tungsten, tin). Rwanda's role in the conflict is complex, involving control over resource extraction and smuggling.

Overall, the markets are advised to diversify investments due to the unpredictable economic climate and geopolitical tensions."

Marc Filippino
Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Thursday, February 6th. And this is your FT News Briefing. Nations are reacting to President Donald Trump’s plan for Gaza, and the US is closing a trade loophole that a lot of Chinese ecommerce giants love. Plus, there’s a showdown brewing between America and Europe over AI regulations. I’m Marc Filipino, and here’s the news you need to start your day.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Countries across Europe and the Middle East are strongly pushing back against Donald Trump’s plan to take over Gaza. Saudi Arabia said it would not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without an independent Palestinian state. Jordan and Egypt also rejected Trump’s plans for Gaza. Turkey’s foreign minister called the remarks unacceptable. In Europe, Germany said Trump’s plans would lead to new suffering, and the UK said Palestinians in the area must be allowed to rebuild. The White House yesterday clarified Trump’s statement, saying that the president did not necessarily mean a military intervention.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

The European Union has American AI companies in its crosshairs. Brussels is pushing ahead with new rules on artificial intelligence, even as Donald Trump warns that he’ll hit back if US companies are fined. I’m joined now by the FT’s Barbara Moens to talk about this. Hi, Barbara.

Barbara Moens
Hi, Marc.

Marc Filippino
So the EU wants to enforce its new set of AI regulations. Barbara, what are some of the most important or I guess, you know, controversial parts of the AI Act?

Barbara Moens
This law is really seen as the world’s most comprehensive regulatory framework for AI. And what you need to know is that companies that fail to comply could eventually face huge fines and could be banned from the EU, which is obviously sensitive for some of the big AI companies. This week, we had some key provisions banning certain applications, such as social scoring, which came into force, and then over the next two years we’ll have other provisions targeting large AI models that will be rolled out.

Marc Filippino
And how do some of these AI companies feel about that, Barbara?

Barbara Moens
So they argue that while there is a need for regulation that this law and some of the consequences are going too far. We had this week Meta’s chief lobbyist Joel Kaplan arguing that the EU’s approach towards AI will be unworkable, and also that it will hamper innovation and investments in AI in the continent. Meta has really been leading the charge against the EU’s regulations towards AI, and warning that, you know, the EU is trying to do two things at the same time. The EU wants to be more competitive and, at the other hand, it’s regulating too much.

Marc Filippino
And like I said, Trump has threatened to retaliate in some way or another against the EU if they hit US companies with fines. How are officials in Brussels thinking about that?

Barbara Moens
It creates enormous nervousness. Obviously, the commission has been cracking down on big tech to protect the continent’s digital markets. And since Trump’s election and his warnings towards Brussels, the EU has already moved to reassess some of the probes into companies such as Apple, Meta and Google. When it comes to this specific Act and its approach towards AI that also wants to make sure that there is still innovation possible and still investment possible in the European Union.

Marc Filippino
It sounds like a pretty delicate balance. How do you see that working in practice?

Barbara Moens
I think there will be a lot of discussions still when it comes to the EU’s approach towards big tech, whether it’s on AI, whether it’s on the Digital Markets Act, other legislation of the EU. And one of the key things that we’ll be looking out for is how this fits with other discussions that the EU will have with the US, right — when it comes to avoiding a trade war, for example, when it comes to security on Ukraine. How important is it for the EU to actually make sure that it keeps this really tough regulatory approach towards US tech companies, especially if you look at it from a broader political or geopolitical perspective?

Marc Filippino

Barbara Moens

Marc Filippino
Disney is basking in the glow of its recent box office successes. The film Moana 2 helped boost the company’s earnings up 27 per cent last quarter. Disney had a baller 2024 at the movies. The studio pumped out the top three films worldwide last year. That includes Inside Out 2, Deadpool & Wolverine and yeah, Moana 2. That’s a big rebound from 2023 when a lot of investors were worried that the creative spark had left the Magic Kingdom. Still, the earnings report wasn’t all wishes upon a star. Disney’s theme parks struggled last quarter after two hurricanes hit Florida. Now, investors have been watching this part of the business closely. The company’s shares ended down yesterday around 2.5 per cent.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

When Donald Trump hit Chinese imports with an additional 10 per cent tariff. He also abolished these kind of wonky rules called de minimis, they’re a trade loophole that exempts shipments of cheaper goods from paying any taxes, which is a pretty big deal if you’re a massive retailer like Temu or Shein. William Langley has been looking into what this means for the Chinese ecommerce groups. He joins me now. Hey, Will.

William Langley
Hi. Great to be here.

Marc Filippino
So first of all, just give me a rundown of how this loophole works and how businesses like Shein and Temu have taken advantage of it.

William Langley
A lot of countries have de minimis rules, which basically set a monetary threshold below which imported items are able to avoid customs duties. In the US, that’s shipments below $800 in value. So while these allowances were really designed to avoid placing excessive costs on consumers and businesses when they import low-value shipments from overseas, Temu and Shein have basically identified that selling small value shipments often by airfreight rather than settling things in bulk orders that often go by sea — as a lot of larger trading firms do — means that they can deliver goods to Western consumers more quickly and more cheaply.

Marc Filippino
And why would the US wanna end this loophole?

William Langley
So there are a couple of reasons. Former US President Joe Biden had already lined up some new rules that were gonna restrict de minimis exemptions. The US has said for a long time that they fear this exemption is allowing Chinese ecommerce platforms to undercut local retailers or local groups that have to settle their orders in bulk, and therefore have to pay customs duties. However, the latest scrapping of de minimis came as a subclause on something entirely different, which was an executive order enforcing new tariffs on China, which was done with the stated aim of reducing the flow of fentanyl into the US from overseas. The rationale being that a lot of this stuff comes in small packages.

Marc Filippino
Well, given the extent that Temu and Shein seem to have relied on de minimis, how big of a deal is it for their bottom line that the rules are changing?

William Langley
The rule change is gonna make customs clearance for small-value shipments from companies like Temu and Shein significantly more complicated in the US, and is likely to increase the workload of customs officials. So if you look at a company like Shein, costs are likely to rise, but it’s unclear quite how much that will affect their bottom line.

Temu, meanwhile, has been recruiting sellers who have warehouse operations in the US. Shein has also been expanding their logistics footprint there. The idea behind that is likely that if you have warehouses in the US, you can switch to ordering items in bulk through the normal channels and storing them in warehouses as other platforms like Amazon predominantly do. It should be good news for Amazon, who are much less reliant on cheap de minimis duty-free shipments than rivals like Shein or Temu.

Marc Filippino
You know, I got to imagine there might be some unintended consequences for closing down this tax exemption. We’ve been talking about these corporate giants, but will smaller, you know, maybe less flexible companies pay?

William Langley
Well, de minimis was originally designed to reduce the costs to small businesses and households for the various gizmos and widgets that they might need to buy from overseas to go about their daily lives or run their small businesses. That’s gonna be much more difficult now. A lot of people see this as part of an opening salvo in Donald Trump’s trade war with China. So whether that’s the suppliers to Shein and Temu — small factories, small businesses in China — or whether that’s the platforms themselves, a lot of people are hoping that Xi Jinping and Donald Trump will get on the phone and hash out some sort of deal.

",2025-02-05,This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode,"In the latest FT News Briefing, key updates focus on three main issues:

1. **Trump's Gaza Plan**: Several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and Turkey, strongly oppose President Trump's plans for Gaza, stressing the need for an independent Palestinian state. Europe echoes similar concerns, with Germany and the UK warning about potential suffering for Palestinians. The White House clarified that Trump's comments did not imply military action.

2. **EU AI Regulations**: The European Union is advancing comprehensive regulations on artificial intelligence, which could impose heavy fines and bans on non-compliant U.S. tech companies. The legislation includes bans on practices like social scoring. Companies like Meta argue that the regulations are too stringent and inhibit innovation. Trump's administration has threatened retaliation against the EU for these actions, causing concern among European officials about balancing regulation with the need for competitiveness.

3. **Change in U.S. Trade Rules**: The U.S. has eliminated a trade loophole known as de minimis, which allowed lower-value imports to bypass customs duties. This change mainly impacts Chinese e-commerce companies like Shein and Temu, making customs processes more complex and potentially increasing their costs. The move stems from concerns that these companies undercut local retailers. Smaller businesses that relied on de minimis exemptions may face greater import costs, complicating their operations. 

Overall, these developments highlight ongoing geopolitical tensions and regulatory challenges in international trade and technology."

Sonja Hutson
Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Wednesday, February 5th. And this is your FT News Briefing. The ABCs of Alphabet’s earnings report left a lot to be desired. And the threat of US tariffs is giving companies a headache. Plus, can India’s IPO market keep up the momentum? I’m Sonja Hutson, and here’s the news you need to start your day.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Google’s parent company, Alphabet, reported fourth-quarter earnings yesterday and things were not pretty. Revenues for the tech giant rose last quarter, but they missed Wall Street’s revenue expectations by about a billion dollars. Cloud revenue fell short by about $200mn. It’s been a bad couple of days for cloud services. Last week, Microsoft reported that its service had slower growth than expected too. Investors were pretty caught off guard by Alphabet’s miss. The company’s share price fell about 7 per cent in after-hours trading yesterday.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

It has been a wild few days for corporate America, thanks to Donald Trump’s unpredictable trade war. From tequila makers and meatpackers to surgical equipment manufacturers, a lot of US companies have been scrambling to try and protect their supply chains. My colleague Gregory Meyer has been reporting on this and he joins me now. Hey, Greg.

Gregory Meyer
Hello. Thanks for having me.

Sonja Hutson
Thanks for being on the show. So do me a favour and just remind us about all this whiplash that companies have been facing in the past few days.

Gregory Meyer
After threatening them earlier on Saturday, President Trump made official new tariffs of 25 per cent on goods imported from Mexico and Canada. He also announced an additional 10 per cent tariff on imports from China. These were all set to take effect on Tuesday. In the end, the tariffs on Mexico and Canada were delayed for 30 days, while as of Tuesday, the tariffs on China were in force. And this whiplash from the tariff announcements sent companies scrambling to respond and examine how they were exposed.

Sonja Hutson
Yeah. Just how vulnerable are some North American businesses?

Gregory Meyer
Some industries are very exposed to additional tariffs. The carmaking industry in particular is highly integrated across the continent. The big three automakers, Ford, GM and Stellantis, for example, have plants scattered across the countries, and then their parts suppliers also have facilities. And cars, as they are slowly assembled, can be shipped back and forth across various borders before they finally hit the dealer lot. So in the end, it could potentially add a significant amount to the price of a car.

Sonja Hutson
Now, the tariffs for Mexico and Canada have been put on hold, but the threat’s still there, right? So how are companies trying to protect themselves from any future tariffs?

Gregory Meyer
Right now, most companies have been speaking carefully, shall we say, I think partly to avoid antagonising the administration and probably coz they just don’t know. The tariffs have different effects on different industries. In some cases, you have products that are perishable and you need to find a market for your product before your product goes bad. We heard the CEO of Tyson Foods, which is the biggest meatpacker in the US, on an earnings call this week saying that this company is doing contingency planning for potential retaliatory tariffs. He’s particularly talking about pork sold into Mexico. Mexico is the biggest foreign buyer of US-grown pork, and he said Tyson would need to find other markets.

Sonja Hutson
I guess looking more in the long-term here, though, how might all this uncertainty surrounding tariffs, you know this, will they or won’t they happen? How will that influence the way that companies plan for future business?

Gregory Meyer
That’s a really good question, because companies, you know, when they’re making investments, they’re thinking about getting a pay-off in years. And when Trump was first in office, just, for example, heavy tariffs were imposed on China. And you did see increased investment, more manufacturing capacity shift to places like south-east Asia. A lot of what I’ve been hearing and reading from the executives, US companies in the past several years is that they’ve worked to diversify their supply chains, just like an investor may try to diversify their stock portfolio to avoid being overly concentrated on, you know, one big name. A lot of companies are trying to hedge their bets, depending on whoever the next new target of tariffs may be.

Sonja Hutson
Gregory Meyer is the US consumer editor for the FT. Thanks, Greg.

Gregory Meyer
Thank you very much.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Sonja Hutson
Now, Mexico and Canada have struck tariff deals with the US, but China is still in the thick of it and Beijing is hitting back. China imposed a levy on American products ranging from cars to liquefied natural gas. The Chinese government kept them pretty limited in scope to avoid a full-blown trade war. China also revived antitrust investigations into Google and Nvidia, and it’s considering a new one against Intel. The idea is to get more leverage for negotiations with Trump. Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to speak to Trump in the next few days.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Last year, India’s initial public offering market was scorching hot. The country raised more than $19bn, only second to the US. And this year, India’s IPO market could be even hotter. The FT’s Chris Kay is in Mumbai, and he joins me now to explain. Hi, Chris.

Chris Kay
Hi there.

Sonja Hutson
So tell me a little bit more about this year’s IPO landscape. What are we expecting to see?

Chris Kay
Yeah. So India really had a blockbuster year for IPOs in 2024, and a lot of investment bankers are saying that at least seven companies are looking to raise $1bn in 2025, which would be more than double that of last year. And one estimate that we’ve seen is that the funds raised through floats could surpass $23bn. So they’re saying that the outlook’s looking great on that front and a lot of companies are lined up.

Sonja Hutson
Can you give a little bit of background on what’s been going on in India’s equity markets?

Chris Kay
So the backdrop to this is that India’s equity valuations have been elevated for quite a while and particularly last year. So a lot of companies really seized the moment. Many investors, private equity firms, business founders saw it as an opportunity to cash out to really fuelling this bonanza of public listings. And fuelling that as well was a strong support from domestic investors and mutual funds. So many Indians have been increasingly buying into local equities when perhaps they used to invest in real estate or gold. So we’ve seen these flows propping up the market and generally making things expensive and lofty. And so the narrative was looking pretty rosy and compelling for a lot of companies here to consider listing and a lot of investors to buy into that.

Sonja Hutson
Right. And who are some of the leading players in this year’s IPO market? Who’s raising this money and who’s ready to float?

Chris Kay
Among the names touted and those that have announced their intentions so far with the market regulator is online brokerage Groww, that’s with two Ws at the end of the name. There’s a fintech company called Pine Labs and a SoftBank-backed eyewear brand called Lenskart. So those are kind of three of the domestic players who may look to raise $1bn or so. And looming in the background is the possibility that Reliance Jio, which is India’s largest telecoms business that’s owned by Asia’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, could also come to market, which would be huge. But the company itself hasn’t set out any timeline yet for that.

Sonja Hutson
OK. So there’s definitely some momentum in the market right now. Is there anything that could hold it back?

Chris Kay
So beyond the frothy valuations that are generally more than 20 times earnings and making India one of the most expensive stock markets globally, there have also been some concerns about the quality of some of the smaller and often low-growth companies here that have listed over the past year. There’s also been some general criticism that some corporates and business founders have, in the words of, I guess, one bank we spoke to have been using India’s markets as a kind of, quote, cash-withdrawing machine rather than, say, using the funds they’ve raised to invest in expansion, for instance.

The big three automakers, Ford, GM and Stellantis, for example, have plants scattered across the countries, and then their parts suppliers also have facilities. And cars, as they are slowly assembled, can be shipped back and forth across various borders before they finally hit the dealer lot. So in the end, it could potentially add a significant amount to the price of a car. Sonja Hutson
Now, the tariffs for Mexico and Canada have been put on hold, but the threat’s still there, right? So how are companies trying to protect themselves from any future tariffs? Gregory Meyer
Right now, most companies have been speaking carefully, shall we say, I think partly to avoid antagonising the administration and probably coz they just don’t know. The tariffs have different effects on different industries. In some cases, you have products that are perishable and you need to find a market for your product before your product goes bad. We heard the CEO of Tyson Foods, which is the biggest meatpacker in the US, on an earnings call this week saying that this company is doing contingency planning for potential retaliatory tariffs. He’s particularly talking about pork sold into Mexico. Mexico is the biggest foreign buyer of US-grown pork, and he said Tyson would need to find other markets. Sonja Hutson
I guess looking more in the long-term here, though, how might all this uncertainty surrounding tariffs, you know this, will they or won’t they happen? How will that influence the way that companies plan for future business? Gregory Meyer
That’s a really good question, because companies, you know, when they’re making investments, they’re thinking about getting a pay-off in years. And when Trump was first in office, just, for example, heavy tariffs were imposed on China. And you did see increased investment, more manufacturing capacity shift to places like south-east Asia. A lot of what I’ve been hearing and reading from the executives, US companies in the past several years is that they’ve worked to diversify their supply chains, just like an investor may try to diversify their stock portfolio to avoid being overly concentrated on, you know, one big name. A lot of companies are trying to hedge their bets, depending on whoever the next new target of tariffs may be. Sonja Hutson
Gregory Meyer is the US consumer editor for the FT. Thanks, Greg. Gregory Meyer
Thank you very much. [MUSIC PLAYING] Sonja Hutson Now, Mexico and Canada have struck tariff deals with the US, but China is still in the thick of it and Beijing is hitting back. China imposed a levy on American products ranging from cars to liquefied natural gas. The Chinese government kept them pretty limited in scope to avoid a full-blown trade war. China also revived antitrust investigations into Google and Nvidia, and it’s considering a new one against Intel. The idea is to get more leverage for negotiations with Trump. Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to speak to Trump in the next few days.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Last year, India’s initial public offering market was scorching hot. The country raised more than $19bn, only second to the US. And this year, India’s IPO market could be even hotter. The FT’s Chris Kay is in Mumbai, and he joins me now to explain. Hi, Chris. Chris Kay
Hi there. Sonja Hutson
So tell me a little bit more about this year’s IPO landscape. What are we expecting to see? Chris Kay
Yeah. So India really had a blockbuster year for IPOs in 2024, and a lot of investment bankers are saying that at least seven companies are looking to raise $1bn in 2025, which would be more than double that of last year. And one estimate that we’ve seen is that the funds raised through floats could surpass $23bn. So they’re saying that the outlook’s looking great on that front and a lot of companies are lined up. Sonja Hutson
Can you give a little bit of background on what’s been going on in India’s equity markets? Chris Kay
So the backdrop to this is that India’s equity valuations have been elevated for quite a while and particularly last year. So a lot of companies really seized the moment. Many investors, private equity firms, business founders saw it as an opportunity to cash out to really fuelling this bonanza of public listings. And fuelling that as well was a strong support from domestic investors and mutual funds. So many Indians have been increasingly buying into local equities when perhaps they used to invest in real estate or gold. So we’ve seen these flows propping up the market and generally making things expensive and lofty. And so the narrative was looking pretty rosy and compelling for a lot of companies here to consider listing and a lot of investors to buy into that. Sonja Hutson
Right. And who are some of the leading players in this year’s IPO market? Who’s raising this money and who’s ready to float? Chris Kay
Among the names touted and those that have announced their intentions so far with the market regulator is online brokerage Groww, that’s with two Ws at the end of the name. There’s a fintech company called Pine Labs and a SoftBank-backed eyewear brand called Lenskart. So those are kind of three of the domestic players who may look to raise $1bn or so. And looming in the background is the possibility that Reliance Jio, which is India’s largest telecoms business that’s owned by Asia’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, could also come to market, which would be huge. But the company itself hasn’t set out any timeline yet for that. Sonja Hutson
OK. So there’s definitely some momentum in the market right now. Is there anything that could hold it back? Chris Kay
So beyond the frothy valuations that are generally more than 20 times earnings and making India one of the most expensive stock markets globally, there have also been some concerns about the quality of some of the smaller and often low-growth companies here that have listed over the past year. There’s also been some general criticism that some corporates and business founders have, in the words of, I guess, one bank we spoke to have been using India’s markets as a kind of, quote, cash-withdrawing machine rather than, say, using the funds they’ve raised to invest in expansion, for instance.

The podcast also covered the impact of recently imposed tariffs by President Trump, notably a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada (delayed for 30 days) and a 10% tariff on China, which are causing significant uncertainty for US companies. Industries like automotive are particularly vulnerable, as their supply chains are integrated across borders. Companies are now looking into diversifying their supply chains to mitigate risks.

In India, the IPO market is thriving, raising over $19 billion last year with expectations to surpass $23 billion in 2025 as several companies, including fintech and brokerage firms, prepare to go public. However, high valuations and concerns about the quality of new listings pose potential challenges for this momentum. 

The podcast emphasized the broader implications of tariffs on business planning and investment strategies while highlighting the robust activity in the Indian IPO market."

Donald Trump voice clip
What a beautiful accent. I would have been president 20 years ago if I had that accent.

Lucy Fisher
Welcome to Political Fix from the Financial Times with me, Lucy Fisher. A special man, a terrific person, a tough negotiator — Donald Trump lavished praise on Keir Starmer after their meeting at the White House this week.

So how did the PM pull off such a diplomatic coup? Coming up: what we can conclude from their encounter. Plus, more ammo, less aid — as the world changes, so do the UK’s spending priorities. Joining me to talk about it all are Political Fix regulars. Stephen Bush. Hi, Stephen.

Stephen Bush
Hi, Lucy.

Lucy Fisher
And Miranda Green. Hi, Miranda.

Miranda Green
Hi, Lucy.

Lucy Fisher
And fresh off Starmer’s plane from Washington, making a heroic effort to join us on Friday, is the FT’s political editor, George Parker. Hi, George.

George Parker
Hello, Lucy. I don’t know if I’m feeling fresh, but thank you very much for having me.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Lucy Fisher
Well, George, we’ve got to kick off with you because you were there in the Oval Office as Keir Starmer and Donald Trump met. They answered extraordinary number of questions there. And of course, they had a press conference later in the day on Thursday. Take us inside the room. What was it like?

George Parker
Well, it’s an extraordinary thing, a Donald Trump press occasion. And in this event it was the Oval Office. And they have what they call the sort of the spray at the staff, which is normally a sort of banal sort of interchange between the presidents and who happens to be meeting him. In this case, the Oval Office was packed full of journalists, there were security guys there — one of them told me off for putting my phone down on the president’s desk — packed in there. And then Donald Trump holds course.

And in this case, he just took questions for, I think, probably 25 minutes. I got to ask some questions as well, which my kids were very excited about. And you know, it’s the Donald Trump show and you’re a part of it. And to be fully honest with you, you know, seeing him operating up close, it’s a more impressive sight, I think, than I probably thought it would be before I went in there.

Lucy Fisher
That’s interesting. What impressed you that you hadn’t expected?

George Parker
Well, it can be the bar’s set quite low because I’ve been to events like that in the Oval Office with President Biden. Famously, he introduced himself to Rishi Sunak. He said, welcome, President Sunak, it’s good to see you here again. Of course he was prime minister and he’d never been there before. So the bar was set low.

But I mean, Donald Trump is someone who is a direct communicator. He was very easy in front of journalists. He was taking questions from all comers, and there was a bit of drama at the start there where Keir Starmer produced this letter from King Charles and Donald Trump opened it live on camera and said how excited he was. The whole thing was beautifully choreographed. It was brilliant TV.

Another point, you know, Donald Trump was someone who, on this occasion at least, was determined to get off on the good footing with the UK, very much in contrast with, you know, the criticism that he’s been raining down on America’s traditional allies over the last few weeks.

Lucy Fisher
Well, Miranda, I’m keen for your overall take as well because it has been pretty much across the board a big win for Starmer. And looking at the headlines and the front pages on Friday morning, the i Paper calls him ‘Charmer Starmer’. Even The Mail grudgingly says what an unlikely bromance.

This is one of the best days of press coverage for the UK prime minister since the election, isn’t it?

Miranda Green
Well, you always wanna deliver wildly on the upside of expectations, don’t you? And I think the whole country was worried about what this meeting would deliver for the UK, particularly in terms of the sort of security crisis in western Europe and around Ukraine.

So yes, the meeting went way better I think even than Downing Street could have hoped, than really the most of the country could have hoped. But, you know, was it the revenge of soft power? And does that mean that all of our problems relating to the Trump presidency are over? Emphatically not.

Because even on this amazing, supposed, you know, rhetorical gift from Trump in the Oval Office saying, you know, we’re gonna talk about a trade deal and then more on that and some sort of technology relationship later in the press conference — you know, all of these things, when you get down to the nitty gritty of the negotiation, things could be much less rosy. But that’s not to say that this wasn’t a very, very good start to a very difficult relationship.

George Parker
And just to pick up on that, Miranda, you see, on the plane back from Washington, you couldn’t hear champagne corks popping at the front of the plane. Yes, they thought it had gone well, better than they’d expected. There was obviously a fair amount of trepidation about the press conference, whether the president could be freewheeling and say all kinds of things, but as you say, the hard work is yet to come.

He didn’t get that big security guarantee. He was taking over a peacekeeping force in Ukraine. And the trade deal has been offered. Well, we can go into that in a minute, but the devil is always in the detail.

Lucy Fisher
Stephen, just your high level take on the events of Thursday. And I wanted, you know, do you think there could be a backlash at all here, those scenes of bonhomie between Starmer and Trump? We know from Ipsos, the pollster, that 6 in 10 Brits have an unfavourable opinion of Trump. Might some members of the British public be a bit uncomfortable seeing them so convivial together?

Stephen Bush
Yeah, I mean, of course, large numbers of British voters, particularly Labour’s traditional Liberal core, are really not gonna like the pictures and the vision of particularly this president of the United States and Keir Starmer appearing to get on. I mean, in some ways this is a visit you have to assess in three different buckets, right.

There’s the Labour party’s electoral interests, which are quite poorly served by a good visit in which Donald Trump says pleasant things about him, Keir Starmer avoids saying something which blows up the whole trip by defending the sovereign rights of Canada, etc etc — all of which is grating for parts of the Labour electoral coalition.

There’s the UK-specific interest bucket where the visit went incredibly well. You know, sign off rhetorically for the Chagos Islands deal, you know, warm and positive language about some form of tech-related trade deal effectively beyond what they could have hoped.

But then, of course, that third bucket of the UK’s interests are our interests as a European nation. And that’s the most important part of the Trump presidency in terms of the challenges facing not just Keir Starmer, but all of his European peers. And even though I don’t think anyone connected to Keir Starmer or any reasonable observer in Westminster really expected that this visit would yield anything useful or productive on it.

It didn’t, right? And that is ultimately the biggest and most important of those buckets is the question of how we in Europe defend ourselves and the challenge that poses for Keir Starmer now.

Lucy Fisher
Well, let’s start with one of the first items you mentioned there, Stephen, as we get into the detail on this trade deal. George, tell us more. It sounds like a semi-skimmed trade pact they’re aiming for, not the full trade agreement, something aimed around technology.

So is this good news for Starmer if we don’t have to get into the subject of agri foods and the age-old row about US chlorine-washed chicken and hormone injected beef?

George Parker
So yeah, anything that gets away from chlorine to chicken is obviously a boon for Keir Starmer. And this is not the full fat free trade agreement that was being promised by Brexiteers back in 2016, which was never delivered. As last group predicted, it wouldn’t be delivered. It’s much more targeted. It’s going to be phased. They can stop with what they think will be the easiest parts of a deal, which would probably include some co-operation in areas like technology, artificial intelligence. And then they’ll move on to trickier stuff after that.

Now in itself, it’s not a game-changer economically. But if progress on the sense that they’re creating this new trade dynamic between the US and the UK, something that Peter Mandelson, the new ambassador, likes to call ‘Mega’, Make our Economies Great Again, if you start to make some progress on that, and that gives Donald Trump an excuse not to hit the UK with tariffs in the meantime — and we know this week he’s been threatening the EU with 25 per cent tariffs — well that’s a big win for Keir Starmer. So even if this doesn’t deliver massive economic benefits, just the fact the two sides are talking and delaying tariffs, that is a win.

Lucy Fisher
Yeah. Stephen, on the tariffs signal that Trump said, suggesting that he would be willing to exempt Britain from this punishing levy if this trade pact is agreed, I mean, how much can we set off stall by that? He did say, you know, we’ll see, regarding the issue of tariffs overall.

Stephen Bush
Well, it’s Donald Trump, so it is always up in the air. But the thing that the UK diplomatic services will hope is that they can do what Jean-Claude Juncker did in the first Trump presidency, where he essentially what looked at a bunch of things in the EU that the EU was already going to do, said we’re gonna do all of these wonderful things, tie it up with a bow, and therefore was able to avoid disaster.

And that essentially is what the Labour government is hoping to do, which is basically go, hey, you know a bunch of tech, then we really like them, we think it’s really good for our public services, non-defence. Why don’t we have, you know, a bow saying we’ll buy that.

And I think, you know, Janan Ganesh wrote a piece a while ago, he said one big risk in this presidency is that if it becomes a cliché that in order to manage Trump, you just need to give him something shiny, then it’s possible that that might suddenly and unexpectedly completely stop working and he might suddenly get very angry about, oh, the letter, oh, the stuff with the bow — all of the stuff which is now currently core to effective Trump management because, of course, he is highly unpredictable, among other things.

Miranda Green
Can I just butt in there, Lucy, to ask you and George, all of you, something. I mean watching it, glued to it, the whole thing yesterday, you know, as the warmth grew and the sort of cosy bromance was developing, there was this kind of cold chill that descended when JD Vance entered the conversation.

I didn’t feel like that in the room, George, because also JD Vance again and again intervening publicly and in the Oval Office meeting to sort of say that they don’t see eye to eye, the administration, with our attitude to tech in the broader societal sense of how tech’s affecting us. You know, even look at the row over internet regulation and AI scraping of creative industries here in the UK. Is that not something that could complicate this? Because there’s a slight feeling of, you know, yes, we’ve won over Trump with all this flattery and the state visit, but his henchmen might not be so easy to deal with.

George Parker
Yeah, I totally agree with that. I mean, JD Vance was definitely the gooseberry in the Oval Office. It was like . . . It was a toe-curling display of flattery by both parties, actually. And JD Vance came in and it was interesting, actually, that he started having a go at the British record on free speech. And it was one of a couple of occasions where Keir Starmer actually pushed back, and he said that we’ve had free speech in Britain for hundreds of years, and we will continue to have it for hundreds of years.

Another point actually where he pushed back was where Donald Trump repeated the falsehood that the EU wants back, or Europeans want back the money that they’ve given to Ukraine. But your central point is really important, I think, about what JD Vance was saying there, because that though I said earlier that the idea of a tech deal is one of the easier things you can do, it can actually quickly become quite difficult because if the price of some sort of deal is that the Americans want, for example, to scrap the Online Safety Act, or they want untrammelled access to NHS states or something like that, oh, or they want to remove some of the protections that are being put in place more generally across the web, then you quickly run into a really serious problem.

So yeah, you’re right, Miranda, that JD Vance was definitely a sort of spectre, spectre of the feast.

Lucy Fisher
And George, what JD Vance said, in particular in relation to his concerns about free speech, was, as he said it, infringements on US technology companies that in turn, you know, had an impact on US citizens. I thought it was striking that in the press conference, Starmer wheeled out this just sort of half line about how the UK is going to avoid overregulation of technology and instead embrace innovation and the opportunities it offered. And it felt to me like that was a signal about where the UK is going to head on regulation of tech, and also a bit of a dig at what the US considers the main concerns about the EU’s approach to the sector.

George Parker
Yeah, really good points. And I interviewed Peter Mandelson for the FT Magazine a few weeks ago now, just before he went to Washington, that he was making a point about the fact that the UK has to take advantages of the opportunities of Brexit, which of course is a strange thing to hear from an arch-anti-Brexiteer like Peter Mandelson.

But in areas of tech regulation, this was always seen as one of the potential advantages of being outside the EU, that the UK could plough its own furrow in terms of tech regulation, not go down such a prescriptive route as the European Union. Now, of course, that carries political risks in the UK if we seem to have weak protections on the internet, but that is definitely the path they hope to follow in an attempt to make the UK the American’s number one partner of choice in developing all these new frontier technologies.

Lucy Fisher
Miranda, let’s come on to discuss in more detail what Starmer achieved or perhaps failed to achieve on Ukraine. I mean, there was no real guarantee from Donald Trump that he’s willing to provide a security backstop to any European forces based in Ukraine after a ceasefire that looks like it might be on the horizon. And to my mind, so, the worrying thing he was trying to suggest was that the US being there and having economic interests in Ukraine, mining for rare earth minerals, and were expecting him to ink this deal with Zelenskyy in Washington on Friday — he said that that would be sort of a guarantee enough for Europe without any sort of hard military power.

Miranda Green
Yeah, really very difficult moments. You know, you could feel all of the Europeans in the room kind of tensing when Trump was not answering the questions — one from you, George, about, you know, whether there would be a proper military and security backstop to ensure that any peace deal, you know, lasts and is safe for Ukraine.

I do think maybe we should take some comfort from the fact that Trump was asked to reiterate his support for Article 5 of Nato: you know, the principle that an attack on one is an attack on all. You know, that is something to know that he still sort of believes in that sort of tenet of the western alliance. But in terms of security on the ground for Ukraine should a peace deal be successfully struck, it seems extremely woolly. I mean, an optimistic take to me might be that if you’ve actually got American companies, dug in and literally digging on Ukrainian soil, perhaps near the border with Russia, then there will have to be some sort of security guarantee for those American workers and for those American companies.

So does it become a kind of de facto security guarantee? But it’s not great. You know, hence George’s pointed question to the president about the backstop. So, you know, being flattered as the UK because we have, you know, incredible soldiers, as Trump said, is no good if it prefaces a statement saying, you know, you’re on your own, guys, you’ll be able to cope, because we won’t. And there was that awful moment where Trump said, you know, could you fight Russia on your own as the UK? I mean, that’s the question nobody wants to answer, let alone the prime minister of the UK in a public press conference.

Lucy Fisher
Yeah, he did eventually say that the US would be there for the UK if British troops did come under attack, but it wasn’t that convincing, was it? Because he kept saying the UK has this incredible military, it can stand up for itself, which nobody on the British side would say after years of hollowing out of the forces.

Miranda Green
No, I mean, what would your defence contacts, Lucy — because you’re really well plugged into that world — what would they think about being called incredible soldiers? We have incredible soldiers, but you don’t need us.

Lucy Fisher
They’d laugh or cry at that suggestion to be quite honest. And even those who, you know, are pleased to see sort of an increase in defence spending, which will come on to, you know, concerned that, you know, not just in the UK but across Europe, it is going to take time to ramp up defence manufacturing capacity across the continent.

So I think, you know, one of Starmer’s key objectives and for all European leaders in the weeks and months ahead is, even if privately, some are concerned that we’re seeing the beginning of the end of Nato, the important thing is not to accelerate that schism, because ultimately it is going to take time for Europe to work out how to defend itself more fully. Stephen, what did you make of one of the most striking moments, I thought, of Donald Trump suggesting or questioning whether he had called Zelenskyy a dictator?

Stephen Bush
In a press conference full of bizarre moments, that was, to me, right near the top of the list, because I think it spoke to the central anxiety everyone has to have about . . . Well, there are so many anxieties one has to have about Trump 2.0. Maybe I don’t want to pick one as the central one. But one of the major anxieties that everyone has to have about Trump 2.0 is who is actually in charge here, right? Not least, Trump has always been inconsistent, but that felt like a moment of like, do you understand what’s going on here any more?

You know, like, are you even able to be across the detail of the mad stuff that you purport to want and not want? Obviously, the hope that Keir Starmer’s European peers will have when they meet to discuss this and the defence issue is that is a sign of him going, oh wait, I don’t actually want to be seen as the president who did X, Y, Z. But the concern will be then it’s a sign that, you know, you might have a good meeting with Trump on some issues, but actually the voices that matter are the ones like those of JD Vance, where you have a much more explicitly and avowedly hostile position towards Britain, Europe and our interests.

Lucy Fisher
Miranda, George, I don’t know if you have any thoughts on that comment, either. Was he being cynical? Was it an attempt to row back from calling Zelenskyy a dictator? Or do you think he genuinely did sort of, he says one thing one day and forgets about it the next?

Miranda Green
Selective amnesia is great when it is working in our favour, but it may not be so good if he decides to, you know, selectively forget some of the commitments he’s made to Starmer. Right? It can swing both ways.

George Parker
I don’t think for a second he forgot that he called Zelenskyy a dictator just a few days earlier. You know, I don’t want to ascribe too much rule coming to Donald Trump. But if you’re trying to strike a minerals deal with Ukraine, you probably want to make it look like you are a mad person who might be prepared to completely walk away from Ukraine, leave it to its fate, calling its leader a dictator, and then, once the deal is signed — it is being signed on Friday.

In fact, as we left Andrews Air Force Base on Thursday night, Zelenskyy’s plane was parked alongside him, he was just getting out of his plane. Zelenskyy will be feted by Donald Trump when he’s in Washington. And you could see the pivot in that press conference. And Stephen was saying, is he true, the idea that he was a dictator, and started talking about the heroism of the Ukrainian people, the struggle against Russia.

And once that deal is signed on, the rare earth minerals, I won’t be at all surprised we start to see some ratcheting up of hostile rhetoric towards Vladimir Putin to try to get him at the table. Now, I don’t wanna sound like I’ve come back from the White House drinking the Trump Kool-Aid. I haven’t, but you can see some logic if you’re trying to strike a deal with Ukraine for some of the crazy things that he’s been saying.

Lucy Fisher
And, George, what should we expect from this meeting that Starmer’s hosting at Lancaster House on Sunday with 18 other European countries to talk about their joint approach to the future of Ukraine?

George Parker
Well, it’s complicated by the fact that Donald Trump has not given Starmer the key thing he wanted from this meeting at the White House, which was the security guarantees around a potential European peacekeeping force, which, by which we really mean American air cover.

And that complicates things at this meeting on Sunday. Keir Starmer is hosting 18 leaders at Lancaster House. They will be discussing about the future of Ukraine following President Zelenskyy’s meeting with Donald Trump. And I think there will be two sides. The first will be a general acceptance in Europe that more needs to be done on defence spending generally. We’ll come on to that in a minute. But the second thing is how do you maintain that peace?

Although it’s interesting that Keir Starmer said that one element of the backstop would be this idea of the American companies operating inside Ukraine may be close to what is now the front line, but they still need more. And there’s still hope in Downing Street that President Trump might be prepared to do more.

But it’s a risky thing for Trump. You know, you have to look at it from his perspective as well. If you have American planes not in Ukraine, but just across the border, ready to come in to defend what would probably be quite a puny European peacekeeping force, you’ve got to explain to your electors who thought you were the president who’s going to stop all these wars that you could at some point — this is the question I put to Donald Trump in the Oval Office — you could at some point be confronting Russians on the front line. And that’s a big step for any president.

Lucy Fisher
Really, really difficult one to answer. Stephen, you mentioned one of the other buckets that was a big win potentially for Starmer, which was this signal from Trump that he’s gonna row in behind the Chagos Islands deal that the UK has negotiated with Mauritius.

And we knew David Lammy, the foreign secretary, said earlier this week that the UK was essentially giving Washington a veto over the deal because of its implications for US security. At the heart of it is giving sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. The UK is going to lease back the atoll of Diego Garcia, which is home to this really crucial joint US-UK military base. That’s really important. I mean, UK officials have been on tenterhooks for weeks waiting for the Trump administration’s verdict on that proposed deal.

Stephen Bush
Yeah, it is obviously a major fillip for the government, not least because although, of course, the vast majority of the Chagos deal was negotiated under the last Conservative government, and the final shape of it has been obvious since it was announced publicly in the autumn of 2022, it’s become this very useful, opportunistic attack line because the government of the day can’t discuss the finances.

The opposition can go, oh, well, you know, you could pay for, you know, flowers and roses and you know, yeah, how many of your favourite things if you just didn’t do this awful deal? And so the relief to them of being able to go, you negotiate a deal, the deal’s fine, stop, you know, floating these, you know, these essentially fictional numbers, will be to them, a big relief once they can have this deal in the rear-view mirror.

Lucy Fisher
And the other big concern of some of the critics of the deal, either playing coy and perhaps the opposition MPs in the UK, but certainly some of Trump’s senior allies had been, you know, security implications of the deal, with Marco Rubio, now the US secretary of state, saying previously he was worried about it allowing China to increase its interests in the Indian Ocean.

Stephen Bush
Although the thing about the China’s interest in the Indian Ocean is many of the people saying that don’t seem to have ever looked at the area on a map. Like, it’s not like a Chagos Islands and the United Kingdom. But Mauritius is letting India build a base on one of the many islands it already has. So China already has a base on Sri Lanka. I mean, it’s not a magical island like, it’s just . . . It’s just nonsense.

Lucy Fisher
And Miranda, what’s the wider impact on UK politics of the Starmer-Trump bromance?

Miranda Green
Oh wow. What a great question that’s gonna be. Because I mean, a lot of it’s gonna depend clearly on whether all of this warmth between the two men evaporates into precisely nothing or something that’s very controversial, as George explained on the tech angle. But I think already there are issues.

There’s very interesting sort of situation developing in Runcorn, a constituency where a recall petition could force a by-election between Labour, who are the incumbents, and Reform in second place — one of the scores of seats where Reform are in second — because then you might get a sort of test case as to how Trump’s unpopularity in the UK affects the Reform party’s ability to win more seats in Parliament.

We’ve got a piece coming up in the next couple of days from Luke Tryl of More in Common on what the Brits really think about Reform’s warmness towards the Trump regime, particularly over Ukraine and the abandonment of Ukraine that we have been fearing for some weeks. And it’s quite dangerous territory for Nigel Farage.

So, you know, will the British public think, you know, Starmer’s pulled off this great diplomatic coup here? I mean, Robert Shrimsley wrote a great column this week about it being a historic opportunity for Starmer to sort of step up and show he’s a statesman. That’s true. Is that the sort of thing that the electorate will care about more than their wider worries about what’s gonna be cut to provide for this increase in defence spending?

So I think the UK political fallout on this is going to be incredibly interesting to watch over the next few months.

Lucy Fisher
And George, of course, as Miranda points out, in preparation for jetting out to Washington, Starmer announced this big uplift in defence spending from 2.3 per cent of GDP now to 2.5 per cent by 2027. And the part of the policy announcement was rather marred by a lot of head scratching and confusion about the figures in question. We were looking into this, weren’t we? And Starmer himself claimed it’s an extra £13.4bn and respected think-tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies says it’s more like £6bn.

George Parker
Yeah, I mean Starmer was playing around with the numbers and using a ridiculous number. Basically, the amount we spend on defence is fixed as a share of GDP in 2.3 per cent. And the way that Starmer calculated was this was in three years’ time, there would have been no increase in the defence budget in the meantime, in line with the rise in GDP. So in fact, the real number is £6bn rather than the £13bn he suggested.

And you know, it’s not true because the amount of money they’re taking off the overseas aid budget to pay for this increase, which is what Keir Starmer said, would be covering the entire increase in the defence budget is £6bn. So the answer is it’s actually £6bn and he’s been playing around with the numbers.

But I thought, you know, it’s obviously significant that he did it in the run-up to the meeting with Donald Trump. It’s not anywhere near enough if you listen to military chiefs as you do, Lucy. So £6bn credit doesn’t sound that great, but it’s a sign and I think it’s an important sign as well ahead of this meeting of European leaders on Sunday that everyone has got to bite this — I’m sorry, bite this bullet — but you know what I mean? And actually increase defence spending because it’s whatever, whether Donald Trump’s in the White House or not, Europe has not been doing enough to defend itself.

Lucy Fisher
And Stephen, George mentions the corollary to this defence spending uplift, which is a big cut to the international aid budget. What’s been your take on the reaction from Labour? I’ve been surprised personally that there has been some anger from left-wing, soft-left MPs, some of it private, but it’s been a more muted response than perhaps I would have expected from a party with Labour’s sort of traditional values.

Stephen Bush
Yeah, although I would say watch this space, right? There are . . . the international aid budget is hugely important, what many Labour MPs did before they went into politics. And of course, the nature of being a Marshall MP, it’s what some of them will believe they will go back into after politics. And that doesn’t just go for the soft-left, but in the middle of the party, in the far left, right? You know, like it’s a huge, you know, item of great pride to many playwrights as well. There’s quite a lot of quiet anger circulating on WhatsApp already.

And I suspect then what we will start to see is, well, precisely organisations where some of these MPs used to work going, hey, you know that our project, this project that you were involved in, is now in jeopardy. So I think the rage on this is going to build. He has, I think, slightly managed to blindside people with it, not least because the weird fiction of this is that at the start of the year, there was this whole thing of, well, at the moment most of the ODA budget is actually going to Ukrainian refugees in the United Kingdom being spent by the Home Office.

But don’t worry, we’ll get that back out and go back to, you know, spending that overseas on the world’s poorest. I think that as the kind of shock of, oh, wait, you’re not going to do that and instead you’re just going to cut some more programs and spend it elsewhere — as that starts to work through the system and as the cross-party alliance on trying to get more foreign aid in Parliament fires up, we will start to see some of the kind of shock and hurt on the Labour benches turned to anger and activity.

Lucy Fisher
That’s right, Miranda, isn’t it? Because I think the figures are that last year, quite a surprising 28 per cent of the ODA budget — the Official Development Assistance budget — was spent in the UK on hotels for asylum seekers and refugees, rather than overseas for the poorest countries.

And an FT analysis this week shows that with this extra cut that Starmer has announced, that close to half the newly reduced aid pot is gonna be spent in the UK, which I think most people find bizarre as a concept, that aid could be spent that way within a technical definition.

On the other hand, this is popular with the public, isn’t it? YouGov survey showed 64 per cent of Britons wanted to see the aid budget cut. So do you think Starmer’s made a canny political move here?

Miranda Green
I think he’s made a short-term ruthless move for the reasons that Stephen has outlined that most Labour MPs, and maybe even a large chunk of support in the country, will just take on board the idea that the world has changed and this is an international crisis, and this is how we have to respond to it.

But in terms of that aid budget being spent on hotels for asylum seekers here in the UK, all the things pinging into my inbox and I’m sure it’s true for the rest of you as well, from people who work in the development world and in those aid projects. It is shock, but it’s also there’s always two or three paragraphs in there protesting about the fact that so much of this money is channelled to the Home Office and saying, you know, this is where we should concentrate some of our lobbying activity to say, you know, hang on a minute, why can’t Yvette Cooper’s department pay for this? Because it’s clearly nothing to do with our HIV programmes in Africa.

So I think this will become more and more tricky in a sense for the Home Office to sort of defend why they’re absorbing so much of the aid budget as it sort of is pushed down. I think there will also, exactly as Stephen said, be a lot of phones ringing from people who are embedded in the world they used to work in, in development and the charity and NGO world, you know, trying to work out what programs can be saved, what can they convincingly say. This is a unique UK project that we’ve proven that can work. You know, if the aid’s smaller, it’s got to be better targeted. And I think actually quite a lot of people in the development world have taken that on board. You know, maybe something can be saved in a positive sense from that.

But I just think that the background politically to this is still what it’s been for the last few months, which is that the government was elected to improve public services. And when you’re actually gonna divert a lot of your spending activity on to defence, and that means you’re able to deal perhaps less with the public services, your electoral problems do, you know, they’re only mounting.

And Starmer proving himself to be effective on the world stage may do something for his personal standing, but will it help Labour’s electoral prospects in the success of their central programme? That’s way more debatable.

Lucy Fisher
George, final word to you on this. I mean, zooming out, this aid cut comes after Starmer for the time being, retaining the two-child benefit cap. He took away the universal winter fuel allowance from pensioners. We think he’s going to try and tackle welfare in quite a ruthless way, to use Miranda’s word.

Is this a sort of sign of him sort of swinging to the right, influenced by Morgan McSweeney, his chief of staff? Or is it, you know, a sort of sign of good politics trying to combat the long-term damaging narrative that Labour administrations tend to be profligate with the public finances?

George Parker
Well, I don’t think it’s instinctively what Keir Starmer would want to be doing, but he’s been driven into these decisions by economics and the dire state of the public finances. And it does have the attendant effect of helping to address your Reform problem on the right. But certainly if you look at some of the things you’ve just listed there, Lucy, and this policy on raiding the aid budget to pay for an uplift in defence, announced against a backdrop of Union flags, of course, is as my colleague Chris Hope from GB News pointed out, almost word for word, exactly the policy set out in the Reform UK manifesto. It’s an incredible thing.

And yes, Morgan McSweeney will be tapping his foot in approval because it’s the kind of policy the Daily Telegraph loves and the Daily Mail and the Daily Express. But, you know, it’s a tough one for the Labour. I’ll just remind you that the 0.7 per cent of GDP aid target was first achieved in 2013 when George Osborne, the austerity chancellor, was in the Treasury, and George Osborne maintained that 0.7 per cent thing all the way through the coalition government. So it’s a big moment for the Labour party.

Miranda Green
It was part of the kind of detoxification project, wasn’t it, during the coalition years? So, you know, will it toxify Labour? I don’t know. It’s a really hard one to call, I think, because of the international crisis being so worrying.

Stephen Bush
Also I think, you know, let’s think about like the Labour electoral coalition as it stood in 2024. Let’s think about the bit of it that voted Conservative in 2015. That is you know, that is why, you know, Battersea didn’t used to have a Labour MP, Putney didn’t used to have a Labour MP, Brentwood and Isleworth didn’t used to have a Labour MP.

People who are quite affluent who have done quite well for themselves, are socially concerned, whose tax is going to go up every year under a Labour government, are they really going to enjoy basically being told, we hate your ideas about tackling the world’s poor, particularly if you’re in Brentwood and Isleworth, we disagree with you, not just on an airport you disagree with for climate grounds, but on your lived and local environment grounds. And by the way, public services in the UK also aren’t getting much better.

I do think that a feature of politics since 2015 has been complacency about that group of swing voters, who have actually mattered quite a lot in every single one of the elections we’ve had since then. And you can easily, I think, imagine a world in which we will wake up in 2024 and went, oh, God, who would, particularly if the Conservatives do, as I’m sure they will at some point, change to a better leader. People going, oh, who would have thought that these former Labour Conservative swing voters might decide, well, look, if I’m not gonna get any of the stuff I want on the social side, maybe I shouldn’t also tolerate a party which seems to treat me as a slightly embarrassing piggy bank.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Lucy Fisher
We’ve just got time left for Political Fix stock picks. Miranda, who are you buying or selling this week?

Miranda Green
So I think I’m actually gonna buy Lin-Manuel Miranda, the writer of the Hamilton musical, on the basis that in the Oval Office, we saw one of the most fun scenes in the Hamilton musical weirdly replicated by Keir Starmer, delivering a message from the King to Donald Trump. In the musical, obviously, that’s George III, you know, being ridiculed as an unpleasant despot, patronising the American colonies. But this was a very different sort of message from the English king.

And this was, you know, King Charles inviting Donald Trump to a state visit, which did seem to work and it seemed to be a diplomatic coup, even though it was a very weird moment, watching in silence as Trump opened the envelope and read the letter from King Charles. So I’m buying Lin-Manuel Miranda on the basis that life was imitating art in a good way this week.

Lucy Fisher
George, how about you?

George Parker
Well, I would buy John Prescott’s stocks because I went to see, talking of Western theatre shows, I went to see a RSC production of Kyoto about the climate change talks back there and the start of the climate change. Also, John Prescott plays a starring role, which I’d forgotten about, but I’m not gonna for him. I’m gonna go for Keir Starmer.

I think it’s unavoidable to say that he had a good week, had the best media coverage I think he’s had since he became prime minister. It was a success by most measures, his visit to the White House. So I’ll go for Keir Starmer.

Lucy Fisher
Stephen, how about you?

Stephen Bush
I am going to buy stock in Wes Streeting. The question mark around Wes Streeting in parts of the Labour party is obviously, you know, Wes is a great presenter, a great media asset, great at getting parts of the press to write him up as a reformer.

But does he actually have a plan to reform the NHS, which is obviously so important to their prospects? And he’s also inherited the same problem that every health secretary since Jeremy Hunt has, which is this deeply ill-advised NHS reorganisation in 2012, then you have to find some way to try and improve outcomes without wanting to reopen all of that unpleasantness again.

He’s, you know, got a new transition CEO of NHS England this week. He’ll hope that will turn things around. I think we’re starting to see the beginnings of a plausible plan to reform and improve NHS outcomes.

Miranda Green
Lucy, what about you?

Lucy Fisher
Well, I think I’ve got to sell Anneliese Dodds this week, the development minister, who had it sprung on her just on Monday, we understand, this huge scythe taken to her budget. It doesn’t seem like she has been particularly cut in to the big plan for the aid budget. So it’s not been a great week for her.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Well that’s all we’ve got time for. George — and by my estimation, you’ve been awake for about 48 hours now and written thousands of words — so I hope you manage to get some sleep this weekend. But George, Miranda and Stephen, thanks for joining.

Miranda Green
Thank you.

Stephen Bush
Thanks, Lucy.

George Parker
Thank you, Lucy.

Hi, Lucy. Lucy Fisher
And fresh off Starmer’s plane from Washington, making a heroic effort to join us on Friday, is the FT’s political editor, George Parker. Hi, George. George Parker Hello, Lucy. I don’t know if I’m feeling fresh, but thank you very much for having me.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Lucy Fisher
Well, George, we’ve got to kick off with you because you were there in the Oval Office as Keir Starmer and Donald Trump met. They answered extraordinary number of questions there. And of course, they had a press conference later in the day on Thursday. Take us inside the room. What was it like? George Parker Well, it’s an extraordinary thing, a Donald Trump press occasion. And in this event it was the Oval Office. And they have what they call the sort of the spray at the staff, which is normally a sort of banal sort of interchange between the presidents and who happens to be meeting him. In this case, the Oval Office was packed full of journalists, there were security guys there — one of them told me off for putting my phone down on the president’s desk — packed in there. And then Donald Trump holds course.  And in this case, he just took questions for, I think, probably 25 minutes. I got to ask some questions as well, which my kids were very excited about. And you know, it’s the Donald Trump show and you’re a part of it. And to be fully honest with you, you know, seeing him operating up close, it’s a more impressive sight, I think, than I probably thought it would be before I went in there. Lucy Fisher
That’s interesting. What impressed you that you hadn’t expected? George Parker Well, it can be the bar’s set quite low because I’ve been to events like that in the Oval Office with President Biden. Famously, he introduced himself to Rishi Sunak. He said, welcome, President Sunak, it’s good to see you here again. Of course he was prime minister and he’d never been there before. So the bar was set low.  But I mean, Donald Trump is someone who is a direct communicator. He was very easy in front of journalists. He was taking questions from all comers, and there was a bit of drama at the start there where Keir Starmer produced this letter from King Charles and Donald Trump opened it live on camera and said how excited he was. The whole thing was beautifully choreographed. It was brilliant TV.  Another point, you know, Donald Trump was someone who, on this occasion at least, was determined to get off on the good footing with the UK, very much in contrast with, you know, the criticism that he’s been raining down on America’s traditional allies over the last few weeks. Lucy Fisher Well, Miranda, I’m keen for your overall take as well because it has been pretty much across the board a big win for Starmer. And looking at the headlines and the front pages on Friday morning, the i Paper calls him ‘Charmer Starmer’. Even The Mail grudgingly says what an unlikely bromance.  This is one of the best days of press coverage for the UK prime minister since the election, isn’t it? Miranda Green Well, you always wanna deliver wildly on the upside of expectations, don’t you? And I think the whole country was worried about what this meeting would deliver for the UK, particularly in terms of the sort of security crisis in western Europe and around Ukraine.  So yes, the meeting went way better I think even than Downing Street could have hoped, than really the most of the country could have hoped. But, you know, was it the revenge of soft power? And does that mean that all of our problems relating to the Trump presidency are over? Emphatically not.  Because even on this amazing, supposed, you know, rhetorical gift from Trump in the Oval Office saying, you know, we’re gonna talk about a trade deal and then more on that and some sort of technology relationship later in the press conference — you know, all of these things, when you get down to the nitty gritty of the negotiation, things could be much less rosy. But that’s not to say that this wasn’t a very, very good start to a very difficult relationship. George Parker And just to pick up on that, Miranda, you see, on the plane back from Washington, you couldn’t hear champagne corks popping at the front of the plane. Yes, they thought it had gone well, better than they’d expected. There was obviously a fair amount of trepidation about the press conference, whether the president could be freewheeling and say all kinds of things, but as you say, the hard work is yet to come.  He didn’t get that big security guarantee. He was taking over a peacekeeping force in Ukraine. And the trade deal has been offered. Well, we can go into that in a minute, but the devil is always in the detail. Lucy Fisher
Stephen, just your high level take on the events of Thursday. And I wanted, you know, do you think there could be a backlash at all here, those scenes of bonhomie between Starmer and Trump? We know from Ipsos, the pollster, that 6 in 10 Brits have an unfavourable opinion of Trump. Might some members of the British public be a bit uncomfortable seeing them so convivial together? Stephen Bush Yeah, I mean, of course, large numbers of British voters, particularly Labour’s traditional Liberal core, are really not gonna like the pictures and the vision of particularly this president of the United States and Keir Starmer appearing to get on. I mean, in some ways this is a visit you have to assess in three different buckets, right.  There’s the Labour party’s electoral interests, which are quite poorly served by a good visit in which Donald Trump says pleasant things about him, Keir Starmer avoids saying something which blows up the whole trip by defending the sovereign rights of Canada, etc etc — all of which is grating for parts of the Labour electoral coalition.  There’s the UK-specific interest bucket where the visit went incredibly well. You know, sign off rhetorically for the Chagos Islands deal, you know, warm and positive language about some form of tech-related trade deal effectively beyond what they could have hoped.  But then, of course, that third bucket of the UK’s interests are our interests as a European nation. And that’s the most important part of the Trump presidency in terms of the challenges facing not just Keir Starmer, but all of his European peers. And even though I don’t think anyone connected to Keir Starmer or any reasonable observer in Westminster really expected that this visit would yield anything useful or productive on it.  It didn’t, right? And that is ultimately the biggest and most important of those buckets is the question of how we in Europe defend ourselves and the challenge that poses for Keir Starmer now. Lucy Fisher Well, let’s start with one of the first items you mentioned there, Stephen, as we get into the detail on this trade deal. George, tell us more. It sounds like a semi-skimmed trade pact they’re aiming for, not the full trade agreement, something aimed around technology.  So is this good news for Starmer if we don’t have to get into the subject of agri foods and the age-old row about US chlorine-washed chicken and hormone injected beef? George Parker So yeah, anything that gets away from chlorine to chicken is obviously a boon for Keir Starmer. And this is not the full fat free trade agreement that was being promised by Brexiteers back in 2016, which was never delivered. As last group predicted, it wouldn’t be delivered. It’s much more targeted. It’s going to be phased. They can stop with what they think will be the easiest parts of a deal, which would probably include some co-operation in areas like technology, artificial intelligence. And then they’ll move on to trickier stuff after that.  Now in itself, it’s not a game-changer economically. But if progress on the sense that they’re creating this new trade dynamic between the US and the UK, something that Peter Mandelson, the new ambassador, likes to call ‘Mega’, Make our Economies Great Again, if you start to make some progress on that, and that gives Donald Trump an excuse not to hit the UK with tariffs in the meantime — and we know this week he’s been threatening the EU with 25 per cent tariffs — well that’s a big win for Keir Starmer. So even if this doesn’t deliver massive economic benefits, just the fact the two sides are talking and delaying tariffs, that is a win. Lucy Fisher
Yeah. Stephen, on the tariffs signal that Trump said, suggesting that he would be willing to exempt Britain from this punishing levy if this trade pact is agreed, I mean, how much can we set off stall by that? He did say, you know, we’ll see, regarding the issue of tariffs overall. Stephen Bush Well, it’s Donald Trump, so it is always up in the air. But the thing that the UK diplomatic services will hope is that they can do what Jean-Claude Juncker did in the first Trump presidency, where he essentially what looked at a bunch of things in the EU that the EU was already going to do, said we’re gonna do all of these wonderful things, tie it up with a bow, and therefore was able to avoid disaster.  And that essentially is what the Labour government is hoping to do, which is basically go, hey, you know a bunch of tech, then we really like them, we think it’s really good for our public services, non-defence. Why don’t we have, you know, a bow saying we’ll buy that. And I think, you know, Janan Ganesh wrote a piece a while ago, he said one big risk in this presidency is that if it becomes a cliché that in order to manage Trump, you just need to give him something shiny, then it’s possible that that might suddenly and unexpectedly completely stop working and he might suddenly get very angry about, oh, the letter, oh, the stuff with the bow — all of the stuff which is now currently core to effective Trump management because, of course, he is highly unpredictable, among other things. Miranda Green Can I just butt in there, Lucy, to ask you and George, all of you, something. I mean watching it, glued to it, the whole thing yesterday, you know, as the warmth grew and the sort of cosy bromance was developing, there was this kind of cold chill that descended when JD Vance entered the conversation.  I didn’t feel like that in the room, George, because also JD Vance again and again intervening publicly and in the Oval Office meeting to sort of say that they don’t see eye to eye, the administration, with our attitude to tech in the broader societal sense of how tech’s affecting us. You know, even look at the row over internet regulation and AI scraping of creative industries here in the UK. Is that not something that could complicate this? Because there’s a slight feeling of, you know, yes, we’ve won over Trump with all this flattery and the state visit, but his henchmen might not be so easy to deal with. George Parker Yeah, I totally agree with that. I mean, JD Vance was definitely the gooseberry in the Oval Office. It was like . . . It was a toe-curling display of flattery by both parties, actually. And JD Vance came in and it was interesting, actually, that he started having a go at the British record on free speech. And it was one of a couple of occasions where Keir Starmer actually pushed back, and he said that we’ve had free speech in Britain for hundreds of years, and we will continue to have it for hundreds of years.  Another point actually where he pushed back was where Donald Trump repeated the falsehood that the EU wants back, or Europeans want back the money that they’ve given to Ukraine. But your central point is really important, I think, about what JD Vance was saying there, because that though I said earlier that the idea of a tech deal is one of the easier things you can do, it can actually quickly become quite difficult because if the price of some sort of deal is that the Americans want, for example, to scrap the Online Safety Act, or they want untrammelled access to NHS states or something like that, oh, or they want to remove some of the protections that are being put in place more generally across the web, then you quickly run into a really serious problem.  So yeah, you’re right, Miranda, that JD Vance was definitely a sort of spectre, spectre of the feast. Lucy Fisher
And George, what JD Vance said, in particular in relation to his concerns about free speech, was, as he said it, infringements on US technology companies that in turn, you know, had an impact on US citizens. I thought it was striking that in the press conference, Starmer wheeled out this just sort of half line about how the UK is going to avoid overregulation of technology and instead embrace innovation and the opportunities it offered. And it felt to me like that was a signal about where the UK is going to head on regulation of tech, and also a bit of a dig at what the US considers the main concerns about the EU’s approach to the sector. George Parker Yeah, really good points. And I interviewed Peter Mandelson for the FT Magazine a few weeks ago now, just before he went to Washington, that he was making a point about the fact that the UK has to take advantages of the opportunities of Brexit, which of course is a strange thing to hear from an arch-anti-Brexiteer like Peter Mandelson.  But in areas of tech regulation, this was always seen as one of the potential advantages of being outside the EU, that the UK could plough its own furrow in terms of tech regulation, not go down such a prescriptive route as the European Union. Now, of course, that carries political risks in the UK if we seem to have weak protections on the internet, but that is definitely the path they hope to follow in an attempt to make the UK the American’s number one partner of choice in developing all these new frontier technologies. Lucy Fisher
Miranda, let’s come on to discuss in more detail what Starmer achieved or perhaps failed to achieve on Ukraine. I mean, there was no real guarantee from Donald Trump that he’s willing to provide a security backstop to any European forces based in Ukraine after a ceasefire that looks like it might be on the horizon. And to my mind, so, the worrying thing he was trying to suggest was that the US being there and having economic interests in Ukraine, mining for rare earth minerals, and were expecting him to ink this deal with Zelenskyy in Washington on Friday — he said that that would be sort of a guarantee enough for Europe without any sort of hard military power. Miranda Green Yeah, really very difficult moments. You know, you could feel all of the Europeans in the room kind of tensing when Trump was not answering the questions — one from you, George, about, you know, whether there would be a proper military and security backstop to ensure that any peace deal, you know, lasts and is safe for Ukraine.  I do think maybe we should take some comfort from the fact that Trump was asked to reiterate his support for Article 5 of Nato: you know, the principle that an attack on one is an attack on all. You know, that is something to know that he still sort of believes in that sort of tenet of the western alliance. But in terms of security on the ground for Ukraine should a peace deal be successfully struck, it seems extremely woolly. I mean, an optimistic take to me might be that if you’ve actually got American companies, dug in and literally digging on Ukrainian soil, perhaps near the border with Russia, then there will have to be some sort of security guarantee for those American workers and for those American companies.  So does it become a kind of de facto security guarantee? But it’s not great. You know, hence George’s pointed question to the president about the backstop. So, you know, being flattered as the UK because we have, you know, incredible soldiers, as Trump said, is no good if it prefaces a statement saying, you know, you’re on your own, guys, you’ll be able to cope, because we won’t. And there was that awful moment where Trump said, you know, could you fight Russia on your own as the UK? I mean, that’s the question nobody wants to answer, let alone the prime minister of the UK in a public press conference. Lucy Fisher
Yeah, he did eventually say that the US would be there for the UK if British troops did come under attack, but it wasn’t that convincing, was it? Because he kept saying the UK has this incredible military, it can stand up for itself, which nobody on the British side would say after years of hollowing out of the forces. Miranda Green
No, I mean, what would your defence contacts, Lucy — because you’re really well plugged into that world — what would they think about being called incredible soldiers? We have incredible soldiers, but you don’t need us. Lucy Fisher They’d laugh or cry at that suggestion to be quite honest. And even those who, you know, are pleased to see sort of an increase in defence spending, which will come on to, you know, concerned that, you know, not just in the UK but across Europe, it is going to take time to ramp up defence manufacturing capacity across the continent.  So I think, you know, one of Starmer’s key objectives and for all European leaders in the weeks and months ahead is, even if privately, some are concerned that we’re seeing the beginning of the end of Nato, the important thing is not to accelerate that schism, because ultimately it is going to take time for Europe to work out how to defend itself more fully. Stephen, what did you make of one of the most striking moments, I thought, of Donald Trump suggesting or questioning whether he had called Zelenskyy a dictator? Stephen Bush In a press conference full of bizarre moments, that was, to me, right near the top of the list, because I think it spoke to the central anxiety everyone has to have about . . . Well, there are so many anxieties one has to have about Trump 2.0. Maybe I don’t want to pick one as the central one. But one of the major anxieties that everyone has to have about Trump 2.0 is who is actually in charge here, right? Not least, Trump has always been inconsistent, but that felt like a moment of like, do you understand what’s going on here any more?  You know, like, are you even able to be across the detail of the mad stuff that you purport to want and not want? Obviously, the hope that Keir Starmer’s European peers will have when they meet to discuss this and the defence issue is that is a sign of him going, oh wait, I don’t actually want to be seen as the president who did X, Y, Z. But the concern will be then it’s a sign that, you know, you might have a good meeting with Trump on some issues, but actually the voices that matter are the ones like those of JD Vance, where you have a much more explicitly and avowedly hostile position towards Britain, Europe and our interests. Lucy Fisher
Miranda, George, I don’t know if you have any thoughts on that comment, either. Was he being cynical? Was it an attempt to row back from calling Zelenskyy a dictator? Or do you think he genuinely did sort of, he says one thing one day and forgets about it the next? Miranda Green
Selective amnesia is great when it is working in our favour, but it may not be so good if he decides to, you know, selectively forget some of the commitments he’s made to Starmer. Right? It can swing both ways. George Parker I don’t think for a second he forgot that he called Zelenskyy a dictator just a few days earlier. You know, I don’t want to ascribe too much rule coming to Donald Trump. But if you’re trying to strike a minerals deal with Ukraine, you probably want to make it look like you are a mad person who might be prepared to completely walk away from Ukraine, leave it to its fate, calling its leader a dictator, and then, once the deal is signed — it is being signed on Friday.  In fact, as we left Andrews Air Force Base on Thursday night, Zelenskyy’s plane was parked alongside him, he was just getting out of his plane. Zelenskyy will be feted by Donald Trump when he’s in Washington. And you could see the pivot in that press conference. And Stephen was saying, is he true, the idea that he was a dictator, and started talking about the heroism of the Ukrainian people, the struggle against Russia.  And once that deal is signed on, the rare earth minerals, I won’t be at all surprised we start to see some ratcheting up of hostile rhetoric towards Vladimir Putin to try to get him at the table. Now, I don’t wanna sound like I’ve come back from the White House drinking the Trump Kool-Aid. I haven’t, but you can see some logic if you’re trying to strike a deal with Ukraine for some of the crazy things that he’s been saying. Lucy Fisher
And, George, what should we expect from this meeting that Starmer’s hosting at Lancaster House on Sunday with 18 other European countries to talk about their joint approach to the future of Ukraine? George Parker Well, it’s complicated by the fact that Donald Trump has not given Starmer the key thing he wanted from this meeting at the White House, which was the security guarantees around a potential European peacekeeping force, which, by which we really mean American air cover.  And that complicates things at this meeting on Sunday. Keir Starmer is hosting 18 leaders at Lancaster House. They will be discussing about the future of Ukraine following President Zelenskyy’s meeting with Donald Trump. And I think there will be two sides. The first will be a general acceptance in Europe that more needs to be done on defence spending generally. We’ll come on to that in a minute. But the second thing is how do you maintain that peace?  Although it’s interesting that Keir Starmer said that one element of the backstop would be this idea of the American companies operating inside Ukraine may be close to what is now the front line, but they still need more. And there’s still hope in Downing Street that President Trump might be prepared to do more.  But it’s a risky thing for Trump. You know, you have to look at it from his perspective as well. If you have American planes not in Ukraine, but just across the border, ready to come in to defend what would probably be quite a puny European peacekeeping force, you’ve got to explain to your electors who thought you were the president who’s going to stop all these wars that you could at some point — this is the question I put to Donald Trump in the Oval Office — you could at some point be confronting Russians on the front line. And that’s a big step for any president. Lucy Fisher Really, really difficult one to answer. Stephen, you mentioned one of the other buckets that was a big win potentially for Starmer, which was this signal from Trump that he’s gonna row in behind the Chagos Islands deal that the UK has negotiated with Mauritius.  And we knew David Lammy, the foreign secretary, said earlier this week that the UK was essentially giving Washington a veto over the deal because of its implications for US security. At the heart of it is giving sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. The UK is going to lease back the atoll of Diego Garcia, which is home to this really crucial joint US-UK military base. That’s really important. I mean, UK officials have been on tenterhooks for weeks waiting for the Trump administration’s verdict on that proposed deal. Stephen Bush Yeah, it is obviously a major fillip for the government, not least because although, of course, the vast majority of the Chagos deal was negotiated under the last Conservative government, and the final shape of it has been obvious since it was announced publicly in the autumn of 2022, it’s become this very useful, opportunistic attack line because the government of the day can’t discuss the finances.  The opposition can go, oh, well, you know, you could pay for, you know, flowers and roses and you know, yeah, how many of your favourite things if you just didn’t do this awful deal? And so the relief to them of being able to go, you negotiate a deal, the deal’s fine, stop, you know, floating these, you know, these essentially fictional numbers, will be to them, a big relief once they can have this deal in the rear-view mirror. Lucy Fisher
And the other big concern of some of the critics of the deal, either playing coy and perhaps the opposition MPs in the UK, but certainly some of Trump’s senior allies had been, you know, security implications of the deal, with Marco Rubio, now the US secretary of state, saying previously he was worried about it allowing China to increase its interests in the Indian Ocean. Stephen Bush
Although the thing about the China’s interest in the Indian Ocean is many of the people saying that don’t seem to have ever looked at the area on a map. Like, it’s not like a Chagos Islands and the United Kingdom. But Mauritius is letting India build a base on one of the many islands it already has. So China already has a base on Sri Lanka. I mean, it’s not a magical island like, it’s just . . . It’s just nonsense. Lucy Fisher
And Miranda, what’s the wider impact on UK politics of the Starmer-Trump bromance? Miranda Green Oh wow. What a great question that’s gonna be. Because I mean, a lot of it’s gonna depend clearly on whether all of this warmth between the two men evaporates into precisely nothing or something that’s very controversial, as George explained on the tech angle. But I think already there are issues.  There’s very interesting sort of situation developing in Runcorn, a constituency where a recall petition could force a by-election between Labour, who are the incumbents, and Reform in second place — one of the scores of seats where Reform are in second — because then you might get a sort of test case as to how Trump’s unpopularity in the UK affects the Reform party’s ability to win more seats in Parliament.  We’ve got a piece coming up in the next couple of days from Luke Tryl of More in Common on what the Brits really think about Reform’s warmness towards the Trump regime, particularly over Ukraine and the abandonment of Ukraine that we have been fearing for some weeks. And it’s quite dangerous territory for Nigel Farage.  So, you know, will the British public think, you know, Starmer’s pulled off this great diplomatic coup here? I mean, Robert Shrimsley wrote a great column this week about it being a historic opportunity for Starmer to sort of step up and show he’s a statesman. That’s true. Is that the sort of thing that the electorate will care about more than their wider worries about what’s gonna be cut to provide for this increase in defence spending?  So I think the UK political fallout on this is going to be incredibly interesting to watch over the next few months. Lucy Fisher
And George, of course, as Miranda points out, in preparation for jetting out to Washington, Starmer announced this big uplift in defence spending from 2.3 per cent of GDP now to 2.5 per cent by 2027. And the part of the policy announcement was rather marred by a lot of head scratching and confusion about the figures in question. We were looking into this, weren’t we? And Starmer himself claimed it’s an extra £13.4bn and respected think-tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies says it’s more like £6bn. George Parker Yeah, I mean Starmer was playing around with the numbers and using a ridiculous number. Basically, the amount we spend on defence is fixed as a share of GDP in 2.3 per cent. And the way that Starmer calculated was this was in three years’ time, there would have been no increase in the defence budget in the meantime, in line with the rise in GDP. So in fact, the real number is £6bn rather than the £13bn he suggested.  And you know, it’s not true because the amount of money they’re taking off the overseas aid budget to pay for this increase, which is what Keir Starmer said, would be covering the entire increase in the defence budget is £6bn. So the answer is it’s actually £6bn and he’s been playing around with the numbers.  But I thought, you know, it’s obviously significant that he did it in the run-up to the meeting with Donald Trump. It’s not anywhere near enough if you listen to military chiefs as you do, Lucy. So £6bn credit doesn’t sound that great, but it’s a sign and I think it’s an important sign as well ahead of this meeting of European leaders on Sunday that everyone has got to bite this — I’m sorry, bite this bullet — but you know what I mean? And actually increase defence spending because it’s whatever, whether Donald Trump’s in the White House or not, Europe has not been doing enough to defend itself. Lucy Fisher
And Stephen, George mentions the corollary to this defence spending uplift, which is a big cut to the international aid budget. What’s been your take on the reaction from Labour? I’ve been surprised personally that there has been some anger from left-wing, soft-left MPs, some of it private, but it’s been a more muted response than perhaps I would have expected from a party with Labour’s sort of traditional values. Stephen Bush Yeah, although I would say watch this space, right? There are . . . the international aid budget is hugely important, what many Labour MPs did before they went into politics. And of course, the nature of being a Marshall MP, it’s what some of them will believe they will go back into after politics. And that doesn’t just go for the soft-left, but in the middle of the party, in the far left, right? You know, like it’s a huge, you know, item of great pride to many playwrights as well. There’s quite a lot of quiet anger circulating on WhatsApp already.  And I suspect then what we will start to see is, well, precisely organisations where some of these MPs used to work going, hey, you know that our project, this project that you were involved in, is now in jeopardy. So I think the rage on this is going to build. He has, I think, slightly managed to blindside people with it, not least because the weird fiction of this is that at the start of the year, there was this whole thing of, well, at the moment most of the ODA budget is actually going to Ukrainian refugees in the United Kingdom being spent by the Home Office.  But don’t worry, we’ll get that back out and go back to, you know, spending that overseas on the world’s poorest. I think that as the kind of shock of, oh, wait, you’re not going to do that and instead you’re just going to cut some more programs and spend it elsewhere — as that starts to work through the system and as the cross-party alliance on trying to get more foreign aid in Parliament fires up, we will start to see some of the kind of shock and hurt on the Labour benches turned to anger and activity. Lucy Fisher That’s right, Miranda, isn’t it? Because I think the figures are that last year, quite a surprising 28 per cent of the ODA budget — the Official Development Assistance budget — was spent in the UK on hotels for asylum seekers and refugees, rather than overseas for the poorest countries.  And an FT analysis this week shows that with this extra cut that Starmer has announced, that close to half the newly reduced aid pot is gonna be spent in the UK, which I think most people find bizarre as a concept, that aid could be spent that way within a technical definition.  On the other hand, this is popular with the public, isn’t it? YouGov survey showed 64 per cent of Britons wanted to see the aid budget cut. So do you think Starmer’s made a canny political move here? Miranda Green I think he’s made a short-term ruthless move for the reasons that Stephen has outlined that most Labour MPs, and maybe even a large chunk of support in the country, will just take on board the idea that the world has changed and this is an international crisis, and this is how we have to respond to it.  But in terms of that aid budget being spent on hotels for asylum seekers here in the UK, all the things pinging into my inbox and I’m sure it’s true for the rest of you as well, from people who work in the development world and in those aid projects. It is shock, but it’s also there’s always two or three paragraphs in there protesting about the fact that so much of this money is channelled to the Home Office and saying, you know, this is where we should concentrate some of our lobbying activity to say, you know, hang on a minute, why can’t Yvette Cooper’s department pay for this? Because it’s clearly nothing to do with our HIV programmes in Africa.  So I think this will become more and more tricky in a sense for the Home Office to sort of defend why they’re absorbing so much of the aid budget as it sort of is pushed down. I think there will also, exactly as Stephen said, be a lot of phones ringing from people who are embedded in the world they used to work in, in development and the charity and NGO world, you know, trying to work out what programs can be saved, what can they convincingly say. This is a unique UK project that we’ve proven that can work. You know, if the aid’s smaller, it’s got to be better targeted. And I think actually quite a lot of people in the development world have taken that on board. You know, maybe something can be saved in a positive sense from that.  But I just think that the background politically to this is still what it’s been for the last few months, which is that the government was elected to improve public services. And when you’re actually gonna divert a lot of your spending activity on to defence, and that means you’re able to deal perhaps less with the public services, your electoral problems do, you know, they’re only mounting.  And Starmer proving himself to be effective on the world stage may do something for his personal standing, but will it help Labour’s electoral prospects in the success of their central programme? That’s way more debatable.  Lucy Fisher
George, final word to you on this. I mean, zooming out, this aid cut comes after Starmer for the time being, retaining the two-child benefit cap. He took away the universal winter fuel allowance from pensioners. We think he’s going to try and tackle welfare in quite a ruthless way, to use Miranda’s word. Is this a sort of sign of him sort of swinging to the right, influenced by Morgan McSweeney, his chief of staff? Or is it, you know, a sort of sign of good politics trying to combat the long-term damaging narrative that Labour administrations tend to be profligate with the public finances? George Parker
Well, I don’t think it’s instinctively what Keir Starmer would want to be doing, but he’s been driven into these decisions by economics and the dire state of the public finances. And it does have the attendant effect of helping to address your Reform problem on the right. But certainly if you look at some of the things you’ve just listed there, Lucy, and this policy on raiding the aid budget to pay for an uplift in defence, announced against a backdrop of Union flags, of course, is as my colleague Chris Hope from GB News pointed out, almost word for word, exactly the policy set out in the Reform UK manifesto. It’s an incredible thing. And yes, Morgan McSweeney will be tapping his foot in approval because it’s the kind of policy the Daily Telegraph loves and the Daily Mail and the Daily Express. But, you know, it’s a tough one for the Labour. I’ll just remind you that the 0.7 per cent of GDP aid target was first achieved in 2013 when George Osborne, the austerity chancellor, was in the Treasury, and George Osborne maintained that 0.7 per cent thing all the way through the coalition government. So it’s a big moment for the Labour party. Miranda Green
It was part of the kind of detoxification project, wasn’t it, during the coalition years? So, you know, will it toxify Labour? I don’t know. It’s a really hard one to call, I think, because of the international crisis being so worrying. Stephen Bush Also I think, you know, let’s think about like the Labour electoral coalition as it stood in 2024. Let’s think about the bit of it that voted Conservative in 2015. That is you know, that is why, you know, Battersea didn’t used to have a Labour MP, Putney didn’t used to have a Labour MP, Brentwood and Isleworth didn’t used to have a Labour MP.  People who are quite affluent who have done quite well for themselves, are socially concerned, whose tax is going to go up every year under a Labour government, are they really going to enjoy basically being told, we hate your ideas about tackling the world’s poor, particularly if you’re in Brentwood and Isleworth, we disagree with you, not just on an airport you disagree with for climate grounds, but on your lived and local environment grounds. And by the way, public services in the UK also aren’t getting much better.  I do think that a feature of politics since 2015 has been complacency about that group of swing voters, who have actually mattered quite a lot in every single one of the elections we’ve had since then. And you can easily, I think, imagine a world in which we will wake up in 2024 and went, oh, God, who would, particularly if the Conservatives do, as I’m sure they will at some point, change to a better leader. People going, oh, who would have thought that these former Labour Conservative swing voters might decide, well, look, if I’m not gonna get any of the stuff I want on the social side, maybe I shouldn’t also tolerate a party which seems to treat me as a slightly embarrassing piggy bank. [MUSIC PLAYING] Lucy Fisher
We’ve just got time left for Political Fix stock picks. Miranda, who are you buying or selling this week? Miranda Green
So I think I’m actually gonna buy Lin-Manuel Miranda, the writer of the Hamilton musical, on the basis that in the Oval Office, we saw one of the most fun scenes in the Hamilton musical weirdly replicated by Keir Starmer, delivering a message from the King to Donald Trump. In the musical, obviously, that’s George III, you know, being ridiculed as an unpleasant despot, patronising the American colonies. But this was a very different sort of message from the English king. And this was, you know, King Charles inviting Donald Trump to a state visit, which did seem to work and it seemed to be a diplomatic coup, even though it was a very weird moment, watching in silence as Trump opened the envelope and read the letter from King Charles. So I’m buying Lin-Manuel Miranda on the basis that life was imitating art in a good way this week. Lucy Fisher
George, how about you? George Parker
Well, I would buy John Prescott’s stocks because I went to see, talking of Western theatre shows, I went to see a RSC production of Kyoto about the climate change talks back there and the start of the climate change. Also, John Prescott plays a starring role, which I’d forgotten about, but I’m not gonna for him. I’m gonna go for Keir Starmer. I think it’s unavoidable to say that he had a good week, had the best media coverage I think he’s had since he became prime minister. It was a success by most measures, his visit to the White House. So I’ll go for Keir Starmer. Lucy Fisher
Stephen, how about you? Stephen Bush
I am going to buy stock in Wes Streeting. The question mark around Wes Streeting in parts of the Labour party is obviously, you know, Wes is a great presenter, a great media asset, great at getting parts of the press to write him up as a reformer. But does he actually have a plan to reform the NHS, which is obviously so important to their prospects? And he’s also inherited the same problem that every health secretary since Jeremy Hunt has, which is this deeply ill-advised NHS reorganisation in 2012, then you have to find some way to try and improve outcomes without wanting to reopen all of that unpleasantness again.  He’s, you know, got a new transition CEO of NHS England this week. He’ll hope that will turn things around. I think we’re starting to see the beginnings of a plausible plan to reform and improve NHS outcomes. Miranda Green
Lucy, what about you? Lucy Fisher
Well, I think I’ve got to sell Anneliese Dodds this week, the development minister, who had it sprung on her just on Monday, we understand, this huge scythe taken to her budget. It doesn’t seem like she has been particularly cut in to the big plan for the aid budget. So it’s not been a great week for her. [MUSIC PLAYING] Well that’s all we’ve got time for. George — and by my estimation, you’ve been awake for about 48 hours now and written thousands of words — so I hope you manage to get some sleep this weekend. But George, Miranda and Stephen, thanks for joining. Miranda Green
Thank you. Stephen Bush
Thanks, Lucy. George Parker

Trump praised Starmer, marking a surprising diplomatic win for the UK leader amidst the complexities of international relations and public opinion, as many Brits have a negative view of Trump.

The meeting featured an energetic press conference, where Trump engaged freely with journalists, and even opened a letter from King Charles III. However, while initial reports hailed the encounter as a success, experts noted that substantive issues, including a security guarantee for Ukraine and detailed trade discussions, remain unresolved.

Starmer is initiating a phased trade deal focused on technology, which avoids contentious agricultural topics, though its economic impact is uncertain. Moreover, Trump hinted at exempting the UK from tariffs, but observers remain cautious about his reliability on such commitments.

The podcast also delves into Starmer’s announcement of increased defense spending, funded partly by cuts to the international aid budget—an unpopular move that may provoke dissent within his party. As public sentiment leans toward support for domestic aid over foreign assistance, Starmer faces a balancing act to maintain electoral support while navigating complex international and domestic challenges. Overall, the meeting's impact on UK politics and Starmer's strategy will be closely watched in the coming months."

Lucy Fisher
Hello, I’m Lucy Fisher, and this is Political Fix from the Financial Times. Welcome. Coming up: Keir Starmer is set to head to the White House next week. But is he the man to save 80 years of Pax Americana? Plus, exporting the spirit of Maga.

Jordan Peterson voice clip
You’re the men and women, individuals made in the image of God who stumble eternally uphill towards the Jerusalem on the hill, the shining city on the hill.

Lucy Fisher
The rightwing psychologist Jordan Peterson there, speaking at the Arc conference in London this week. It was part megachurch, part political rally promoting American-style Christian values in the UK. But will it catch on this side of the pond? It’s been another dramatic week of world-shaking interventions from Donald Trump, who, lest we forget, has only been in office a month so far. To dissect the latest and throw ahead to the important period of diplomacy in coming weeks, I’m joined by Political Fix regular Robert Shrimsley. Hi, Robert.

Robert Shrimsley
Hi, Lucy.

Lucy Fisher
And the FT’s chief foreign affairs commentator Gideon Rachman. Hi, Gideon.

Gideon Rachman
Hello, Lucy.

Lucy Fisher
Plus, the FT’s defence editor John Paul Rathbone. Hi, JP.

John Paul Rathbone
Hello, Lucy.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Lucy Fisher
So Gideon, take us through the big moments of the week. Trump has called Zelenskyy a dictator. He’s claimed Ukraine started the war and he’s kicked off US-Russia talks about the future of Ukraine without Kyiv being present.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah, absolutely. And I think it all started actually at the Munich Security Conference with the speech by Vice-President Vance saying that European governments were more of a threat to democracy in Europe than Russia. And it’s all kind of gone steadily downhill from there.

And I think that’s what’s dawning on Europeans at different rates and at Brits at different rates is that in significant ways, America is now an adversary. It’s not just an unreliable ally. It’s actually trying to undermine democracy in Europe.

The Trump administration, I have to say, feels closer to Putin’s Russia than it does to the EU. I’m afraid that is the situation. And that’s my interpretation. Not everybody buys that. And one of the things that I find really fascinating is trying to figure out what does actually the British government think. I mean, I picked up from some people kind of in official positions. The adversary word was first used to me by someone who is kind of inner circle. So there are people who think like that. Whether that goes all the way up to the cabinet, all the way to Keir Starmer, they would deny, deny, deny in public. I think in private they’re beginning to think it.

Lucy Fisher
Well, that is really striking. I mean, Robert, is that your take?

Robert Shrimsley
Broadly, I mean, the phrase I hear consistently is amoral, that they’re not used to having to deal with a president they regard as completely amoral on the major issues of freedom and democracy. And it is something they are deeply shocked about. And what was it? They thought they’d prepared for the worst with Trump and that looks even worse. I mean, after the JD Vance I was talking to somebody who was at the Munich conference who described JD Vance’s gaslighting speech, described it as like watching a, if you’ll excuse the language, a pissed Rangers fan goading Celtic supporters. And they were really shocked about it. And yet, on the other hand, there are people on the right in Britain who picked this up, as we may discuss.

I think the government is deeply unsure how to deal with Trump. It had this notion of we can navigate, we can weave between Europe and the US. And every day now there is something that somebody in the British government is looking at and thinking, I don’t know if we can sustain this.

Lucy Fisher
JP, you’ve obviously monitored the shockwaves this has sent through European capitals about what it means for the potential removal or unreliability of the US security guarantee. Tell us a bit about what is being planned across Europe if the US can no longer be relied on.

John Paul Rathbone
So it’s all been a kick in the gender-neutral cojones, right? And it’s been really interesting to see Europe I think it’s fair to say spring into action or wake up. This past week we had meetings in Paris thinking about what to do about Ukraine. There’s more of the same. There seems to be a nascent plan cooked up by France and the UK about how to approach Ukraine should the US seal a deal with Russia. And that’s interesting how they’re thinking about that. And then also this week you had Denmark all of a sudden boosting its defence spending to 3 per cent of GDP. So there is reaction across a lot of Europe. Not all of it. Southern Europe is in a different place, but it’s definitely the snooze button hasn’t been pressed on the alarm clock this time.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah. No. And I think that, you know, again, the interesting conversations at Munich with Europeans, as most Brits who are thinking about this; some of the most influential ones I spoke to I think can see the direction of travel very clearly. But they’re playing for time because they know that rupture with the US, an open rupture now, may be unavoidable, but if it was like, to happen tomorrow or next week, you know, Article 5 is obviously no longer applicable or America pulls its troops out, we’re very underprepared. You know, we don’t have the stuff we can put in place. I say we, I’m talking about Europe, to replace American troops and also equipment, heavy lift, etc, all of that stuff. So ideally we need like five years. We may not get five years, but we’re getting to prepare for that date. And they’re hoping just as like, delay that the evil moment.

Robert Shrimsley
And can I just ask, one of the things that was put to me by somebody trying to analyse what Trump’s been doing in the last week is that actually he arrives, he thinks he’s going to deliver peace really quickly. There’s a Nobel Peace Prize out there with his name on it. He comes up with a plan, and he’s actually a bit shocked to find the degree of rebuff both from Ukraine and from parts of Europe. And what you’re seeing is less a sort of a co-ordinated, strategic way of thinking towards Russia and that actually just this has gone the wrong way and I’m lashing out at the people who are sabotaging. You don’t buy this or you do?

Gideon Rachman
No, I don’t. I mean, I think he’s basically sympathetic to Russia. I mean, and I think that, you know, everybody saw the way this was going. I mean, in the sense that the game that both the Russians and the Ukrainians and the Europeans are playing is he’s a narcissist. Don’t say anything bad about him. And the Ukrainians were hoping that it would be the Russians who would first kind of pissed him off. So they didn’t, like, walk into this. But at a certain point, when he calls your leader (inaudible), there’s not much you can do, really.

I mean, I think probably the Russians played him very well. I mean, JP, you cover the intelligence world, but I remember an intelligence person once said to me that the easiest person to manipulate and bring over to your side is a narcissist, because you know what to say. You say things like people underestimate you. You don’t get the credit you deserve. Let’s do this thing together. We can break the rules. And they’ve got a whole playbook when they encounter a narcissist. And Putin is a former intelligence officer and they’re playing it by the numbers. I mean, right down to saying you won the 2020 election. I mean, you know.

Lucy Fisher
Well, it’s certainly striking, isn’t it, that Trump is explicitly repeating Russian talking points in the way he’s describing Ukraine. Gideon, the initial fear among European allies was that Trump would withdraw material support from Ukraine. Is your assessment we should now view it as him flipping sides to almost back Russia in this?

Gideon Rachman
Well, I mean it’s got a little way to go, but I mean, it’s certainly, as you say, he’s adopted Russia’s talking points pretty much wholesale. And I think that I don’t know what will happen next because Trump is so deeply unpredictable. But I think we can say where his instincts lie. I don’t think there’ll be any more aid to Ukraine, and that could mean that they’re in some trouble on the battlefield and financially quite quickly.

Lucy Fisher
So Robert, Starmer jets out to the White House next week. His team are still talking up this idea of him being this great bridge between Washington and the rest of Europe. I speak to some in government who think that this is a great opportunity for him to sort of seize where there’s a vacuum of leadership in Europe with the likes of Schultz on the way out, Macron on the way out, and he can kind of step into that role. What do you make of that?

Robert Shrimsley
I don’t . . . I find this quite hard to understand, assuming, first of all, that they want a bridge to the EU. I mean, I would have thought that if you were looking for somebody within the European firmament to play that role, that someone like Giorgia Meloni was a better bet personally, as someone who’d be much more agreeable to Trump. I just don’t think that America’s looking for that intermediary role, it’s quite capable of speaking for itself.

I think there are things that Britain can and should be doing, and there is clearly a role within Europe, a leadership role to be taken in terms of thinking about the defence of Europe. Clearly, the UK’s placed itself outside the European Union doesn’t help. You have a number of weak leaders, as you say, although by next week we will understand who’s leading Germany and that will change the calculation.

But I think everybody . . . I mean, I was at a sort of think-tank on Monday, a policy exchange, a sort of Tory-leaning think-tank where HR McMaster, who I think had a year as Trump’s national security adviser last time, was speaking. And even he, when I look back at what he said only on Monday, has clearly been shocked by the way things have turned out, because he was talking about an axis of aggression of Russia and China and Iran together and you can’t take your foot off Russia’s throat too much and Trump will come to understand this. So I think even people within America’s foreign policy firmament are being completely shocked by the way things are evolving.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah. I mean, I think just one way of understanding it, a friend of mine in Washington put it is that Trump’s main project is the destruction of liberalism in America. And in that sense, he regards the EU as part of that liberal firmament that he’s trying to take on and destroy. They espouse the same values. The personal connections are deep, the institutional connections are deep. So in that sense, it’s not that surprising that they want to take on the EU because it’s part of the opposition.

Robert Shrimsley
I mean, just to come back to your original question about the role that Britain can play. I mean, there is something up for grabs. You know, one should be pretty sceptical whether it’s there. But, you know, if Starmer can go to the US and comes away with Trump taking a slightly different position towards Ukraine, taking something much more towards the classic position that Europe would like, well, then he’s come away with something substantial. If the fact that he offered troops when others didn’t gets him a more favourable hearing. I mean, there is the potential that I just think one has to be sceptical about how far you can go with this, but there is something to play for at least.

Lucy Fisher
JP, I’m also interested that, you know, Starmer, as Robert pointed out, has been very forthright in saying he is ready and willing to put British troops on the ground in Ukraine. That’s been kind of walked back a bit by defence insiders who are trying to sort of emphasise, you know, our superiority as a country in air power. The suggestion by western officials that we might be looking at something more like a reassurance force of far fewer troops, about 30,000-odd troops in Ukraine away from the front line, rather than 100,000-odd lining that line of contact. Tell us about that.

John Paul Rathbone
So first, on the Starmer coming out saying we want to put boots on the ground, which was a very unequivocal statement from someone who is patently cautious, made me think perhaps there’s something that he has already begun to discuss with the United States that, I don’t know, open question mark.

Second, on the way they’re thinking about a force in Ukraine, a peacekeeping force that would monitor or rather enforce the ceasefire, the initial thought was 100,000 troops, or is that actually 50,000 troops, which would just be a drop in the ocean in a country as big as Ukraine with a 1,000km front line.

And the one area where the west has an edge and that Putin is afraid of is air power, and that includes the air forces of France and the UK. But, you know, it’s the US that is the big gorilla with all those F-35s. And then, of course, there’s a tricky question which occurs to me now is about permissioning. What if the US says, hmm, all that US kit in Europe, well, actually we’ve decided you can’t use it in Ukraine. I don’t know how far that goes and how much that toggle switches on, off. There might be degrees.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah. It’s a really interesting debate because I think as Europe begins to take this new view of America, Trump is gonna be demanding we buy more American weaponry to close the trade deficit. But it begins to look like a security risk if you can’t rely on the Americans. I mean, so the Danes, in the hypothetical thing that they were in a fight over Greenland, that all their planes are F-35s and they happen to think, well, could America somehow, is there an off switch somewhere in there? Is there a back door that it could be in operation?

Lucy Fisher
And it’s a question mark for the UK’s nuclear deterrent as well, isn’t it, which is operationally independent but relies very much on the US for ongoing maintenance of the warheads?

John Paul Rathbone
Exactly. So, you know, it’s how long it is that before you need to maintain a nuclear missile? Yeah. But I’d have thought it’d be a very bad deal if, you know, tens, hundreds of billions of future defence contracts, suddenly Europe says, actually, no, thanks very much.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah, sure. But that implies that, yeah, that the Americans have thought it through. You know, I think that they’re so confident, they’re so hubristic at the moment. I don’t think it even occurs to them that we might do that. In fact, it was interesting I bumped into an American friend who’s now become an arms dealer for one of the American manufacturers in Munich, and I set up a parley because I was pissed off at the time both at the Vance speech; said, you know, you should prepare yourself that Europeans are gonna not buy your stuff if you’re going like this. And she sort of laughed, you know. They don’t believe it.

Lucy Fisher
Robert, what about UK defence spending, because the backdrop against, you know, Starmer’s quite hawkish talk is still that they haven’t sort of publicly signed off when they’re going to get to 2.5 per cent of GDP. We know that the military chiefs marched into Downing Street — admittedly, invited by the prime minister last week, I should add (laughter) — to ask for it to go up to 2.65 per cent of GDP; you know, got a comprehensive spending review going on where departments are having to make or identify least cuts. It’s not easy to square the circle.

Robert Shrimsley
It isn’t easy to square the circle under the current fiscal rules and the tax constraints that Labour has signed up to. I mean, I think it was very telling that it’s often the case that the first breach between the prime minister and the chancellor is over defence because the Treasury never wants to spend money on defence. And it’s one of those areas where the military can go straight to the prime minister and talk them round. And so it’s interesting that we’re hearing talk about this again. I mean, I don’t think even 2.65 is going to cut it, but . . . And the government doesn’t have any money so it’s gonna have to find ways . . . 

Lucy Fisher
What’s it gonna . . . What do you think they’ll do?

Robert Shrimsley
Well, I mean the answer is I don’t know. I’ve heard talk of extending the freeze on tax thresholds right through to the end of the parliament, which also buys Rachel Reeves a little bit of fiscal wiggle room on her rules.

My own view has been for a while that the logical responses to these significantly changed circumstances is to say we’re going to have a defence levy, rather, as Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson tried to do with health and social care. Say, look, we’re in a different world. We have to able to defend ourselves. We didn’t expect to have to put this tax on, but we’re going to do it.

And I think by far and away the best thing in these circumstances as a political figure, is to level with the public rather than try to pretend that you’re not doing it or find sneaky ways or breach explicit manifesto commitments just to ‘fess up and say, look, the world has changed. We need to be able to defend ourselves against this threat. We’re going to raise this levy. Do I think they’ll do it? I don’t know. It strikes me as a bit too brave, but it feels like the right way to go.

Lucy Fisher
Yeah. I’m inclined to agree, but I mean, JP, that would require a feat of storytelling that is not Starmer or his main allies in the cabinet’s strength. And it’s a huge leap in the narrative that the government has told the public heretofore about our defences papering over all the cracks for many, many years now.

John Paul Rathbone
Well, two things: you can either say we’re gonna stick to our fiscal rules or you can say, well, we’re actually gonna have to cut our armed forces at a time when Europe is more under threat than ever. And I wonder which story is better or least bad, because capabilities would have to be cut at 2.3 per cent. And you can say, well, actually we’re going to have nukes and but we’re gonna have to cut X, Y, Z. And enough politicians have been saying for a long time how hollowed out the British forces are. I don’t think it will come as any surprise.

And second of all, I’m surprised how little political capital, how it hasn’t become a political issue. There’s $300bn worth of Russian assets sitting inside Europe. And I think a chunk of that is inside the UK. And everyone in Europe is saying there’s no money, but there is. And of course, this has profound implications for Euroclear and all of that.

Lucy Fisher
Euroclear being . . . 

John Paul Rathbone
The Belgium clearing office where a lot of this money is. But I think some of it is also in the UK and that money is just sitting there. If we really are at war with Russia, why not?

Lucy Fisher
Go ahead and seize it? What are the key arguments against that, Gideon? People say it goes against sort of property rights. It could have a chill effect on inward investment to the UK and wider EU.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah, all of that and yeah, that we rely on the rule of law and that other countries that think that they might one day be it have a — ‘cause we’re not actually at war with Russia.

John Paul Rathbone
That’s debatable.

Gideon Rachman
. . . have a conflict with us would be worried about putting their money into Britain and the City’s really important. I mean, China, for example, might hesitate.

Robert Shrimsley
It’s a strong argument as well.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah.

Lucy Fisher
But JP, what you say is interesting. You know, it’s debatable whether the UK is at war because you and I speak to people in the MoD, you far more than me, who do view the UK at war with Russia in a kind of hybrid or grey zone sense.

John Paul Rathbone
So Russia is doing warlike things to the UK. It is below the so-called threshold of war but, you know, there are assassination attempts, there is sabotage, there are bombs on DHL planes that fortunately haven’t gone off. There are spies doing all sorts of nefarious stuff. So in the Russian view, you know, war is a spectrum. It’s not an on/off switch. It’s not black and white. It’s shades of grey. And there’s definitely stuff that Russia is doing that counts as warlike — not enough to trigger Article 5 . . . 

Gideon Rachman
Of course they would, I mean . . . 

John Paul Rathbone
It’s all deniable, of course.

Gideon Rachman
And also they would say we’re doing the same because we’ve given Ukraine missiles that have been hitting them. I mean, I’m not justifying their actions, but that’s how wars start, I guess.

Lucy Fisher
So to wrap up, I mean, the fact we’re sitting here talking about the US as a potential adversary to the UK, to the rest of Europe, I mean, this is a strategic shock on a par with what, Suez?

Gideon Rachman
Oh, far bigger than that.

Lucy Fisher
Far bigger than that. 9/11.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah. I mean, I think it’s the biggest . . . Look, I hope I look back on this podcast in a year’s time and think, oh, I really lost the plot, completely hysterical. (Lucy laughs) And it was like, not as bad. But if you had to ask me what I honestly think, I think we’re witnessing the breakdown of the postwar order that goes all the way back to the foundation of Nato in ‘49. Whether Nato is formally dead or not, I don’t know, but I think that the transatlantic alliance is collapsing fast.

And is this a permanent thing? I think as long as Trump’s around, it’s permanent. I retain the hope that Trump will implode and a more normal America will reappear. But even then, it’s gonna be a job for them to regain the lost confidence from what’s just happening right now.

Lucy Fisher
Robert.

Robert Shrimsley
Yeah. I mean, I think it’s a deeply uncomfortable and frightening period for Europe in which the good scenario is that American commitment is only weakened rather than removed. It is genuinely very alarming.

The only things one could say in terms of trying to keep your head about this is things change in the world. Diplomatic scenarios change. America’s attitude towards its erstwhile allies could change again because things move on.

Equally, one has to keep some sense of perspective about Russia. It is not strong at the moment, militarily. It’s gonna take Russia a while to rebuild from what’s happened in Ukraine as well. So I don’t . . . I mean, I’d be certainly very frightened if I lived in Estonia, but I think if you live in Britain, there are reasons not to lose your head entirely. But it is tell . . . This is the clear point that Europe has got to learn to fend for itself. And it’s really, really got to pay attention to this now.

Lucy Fisher
JP, final word to you.

John Paul Rathbone
I’m sort of anti-catastrophising and the sense of American withdrawal from Europe has been here for a while and European defence types were talking about it under Biden. But this just definitely seems to be like a hammer taken to the edifice. But there is time, as Robert said. You know, Russia had, at best, would take five years to reconstitute its military.

Lucy Fisher
We’ll have to get you back on as events develop. JP, thanks for joining.

John Paul Rathbone
Thank you.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Lucy Fisher
Trump’s return to the white House is having not only major geopolitical ramifications, but a seismic cultural impact. The Maga movement is thriving and that’s created tailwinds for some right-leaning and alt-right figures in the wider west. This week, a major three-day conference dubbed “the rightwing Davos” took place in London. To discuss it, Robert and Gideon are still with us, but we’re now joined as well in the studio by Daniel Thomas, the FT’s global media editor. Hi, Dan.

Dan Thomas
Hi.

Lucy Fisher
So, Dan, you, Robert and me are all schlepped down to the Excel Centre in east London to take in the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship event, or so-called Arc conference, this week. This sounds like a straightforward question, but I think it’s less so than on the face of it. Can you explain what Arc is?

Dan Thomas
An incredibly good question and as you say, quite difficult to summarise. So yeah, the three-day conference encapsulated so many different themes, right? We had Christian morality right to the front. You had all these ideas around the family and the idea that families should have more babies. And the pro-birthers were there, very much so. The net zero was heavily to the fore as well. So there were all these different sort of like neoconservative, almost like verging on fringe conservative, rightwing thinking coming through there, which is fascinating. But at the same time there’s some overlays there, particularly on the Christian side, which I was so surprised about.

Lucy Fisher
Yeah. And so Robert, we had politicians from the American right. We had Trump’s new energy secretary, Chris Wright. We had the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson; on the UK side, Kemi Badenoch, Nigel Farage, and all sorts of cultural figures like the controversial psychologist Jordan Peterson, who’s one of the founders. We’ll get on to some of the politics of it. But just tell me what your impressions were of it.

Robert Shrimsley
I thought it was a very strange sort of event, because I’ve been to Reform party rallies. I’ve been to lots of what you’d call rightwing events in Britain. This was something I thought very different, because the faith infusion was so central to it. It was like sort of this double cult. You had the rightwing politics part and you had the faith part, and the faith part is really right in front of you. I don’t mean mostly, it’s not like evangelical preachers. This wasn’t some Billy Graham stuff. But it’s just absolutely central, like the writing in a stick of rock, to what was going on.

And everywhere, it was all about Judeo-Christian values this and Judeo-Christian values that. And it was an attempt to say, we’ve got to reformulate our thinking and our thinking in the west. And one of the people actually said, going back to, you know, the original manual, which is the Bible, and that is the sort of the rock on which we build it forward.

And the other thing I was very struck by through it all is this sense of crisis which infuses all of the conversations, you know, from Douglas Murray and Niall Ferguson and Jordan Peterson, who was much more of a crisis-monger than I’d ever really understood, I think, before; talking about the climate scam and the dangers of homosexuality. It was quite a thing.

And I thought this sense of crisis is one of the things that is really happening in the right and particularly the Maga-fied right. Look at the issues that they talk about, you know — the falling birth rate, questions around free speech, some of the issues around net zero, around mass immigration.

So yeah, these are all issues. These are all things you’ve to think about. But are these actually the great terminal moral crisis which you are portraying them as being? And I think it’s that doominess that makes this such a strange gathering.

Lucy Fisher
Yes, you’re right. This idea of a civilisation, western civilisation, being at a tipping point . . . 

Robert Shrimsley
Well, they called it a civilisational moment.

Lucy Fisher
They do. We’ll talk more about the conference, but Gideon, from your perspective, I mean, this was very much an Anglosphere conference. They were proud that they’d got a thousand people from the US, 300-odd from Australia and New Zealand, some from Europe, Africa, and that it’s grown from 1,500 people in its first year to 4,000 people this year. Is this kind of rise of sort of rightwing kind of cultural, political movement? Are we seeing that across the rest of Europe?

Gideon Rachman
Well, I think that’s certainly what Vance’s speech was, in a sense. That was the audience for Vance’s speech that we were talking about earlier. They believe that Europe’s lost its way and that the true Europe is represented by parties like the AfD in Germany or Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz, etc. And that in a way, the completion of their American Maga revolution is, I mean, people like Musk talk about saving the west.

So it’s not like they’re . . . You know, in some sense they do care about Europe, but they look at Europe I think in a very distorted way, but with horror and say, you know, it’s got to get back and embrace all these things — Christianity, natalism, mass immigration and you know, that’s got to end and are they flirting with expelling people? I think they are.

So those kinds of ideas are basically a Maga-isation of Europe and Orbán, when he was president of the European Council for a while, adopted the slogan Make Europe Great Again. So it’s an attempt to kind of say Trump has shown the way and this is the way that Europe should move.

Robert Shrimsley
And what made Arc unusual, I thought, I don’t know what you’d guess. I mean, it was this strange combination of lots of the usual Maga crowd and the usual rightwing characters and Douglas Murray’s, but also some genuinely quite thoughtful people. Admittedly thoughtful people from a particular faith-based perspective, but thoughtful, interesting, trying to set out different positions. Paul Marshall, who owns The Spectator and is, I think, a man of faith talking about energy policy and describing net zero policies like unilateral disarmament. Why is Britain the only country pursuing this energy unilateral disarmament?

So interesting ideas being kicked around as well and somehow, that sort of always leavened at times the other parts of it. But what I’m really struck by above everything else is that all of the political energy in British and much of western policy is on the right. And in the end, I think energy often tells, but this is where all the noise, energy, excitement, debate is taking people.

Gideon Rachman
But one of the things that really interests me is I think they might be split by Ukraine. I hope so. (Overlapping speech) terribly fond of them.

Dan Thomas
This is pretty . . . 

Robert Shrimsley
And it wasn’t much and strikingly, it was not talked about that much.

Gideon Rachman
No. But the really interesting thing, I saw Niall Ferguson — you know, I should say, Sir Niall Ferguson — the historian of a conservative bent, spoke at the conference. I mean, I know privately, as you know, spoken about Ukraine as a kind of the moral issue of our times.

And I would say, it’s sort of saying to myself, Niall, like, when are you gonna speak up? Because you can see the direction that Trump’s going. And he finally did. He tweeted yesterday and repudiated everything that Trump had said about Ukraine, and was rewarded with a personal rebuke on Twitter by JD Vance.

Dan Thomas
It wouldn’t have gone down well in the crowd either. There was one New York-based journalist who dared to raise his voice and said, actually, you know, I don’t think Trump, I don’t think Musk adheres to Christian faith. He doesn’t look after the poor, he doesn’t look after the weak. He got booed and hissed as the one dissenting voice and that was striking. That was the one thing which the crowd didn’t like. (Overlapping speech).

Robert Shrimsley
But the other point is, I mean, there’s almost a wilful blindness to the humbug of what this . . . But, I mean, if you take the Vance speech, this is a man who was vice-president to a US president who tried to cancel an election, lecturing Europe about maintaining faith in democracy. This is a man whose White House, or his boss’s White House, is expelling journalists who won’t use Trump-approved language, lecturing about free speech. This is a government that is busy carving up Ukraine, lecturing Europe about the defence of liberty. And yet all the people who supposedly hold these ideals so dear, I just thought, oh, did he? Its looking the other way.

Lucy Fisher
It’s the same hypocrisy we heard from Kemi Badenoch on the stage, I think you could say, because she was talking in the same breath about the importance of free speech, but then also saying that universities were responsible for poisoning minds and the culture in the UK, and actively said, without fleshing it out, that something needed to be done about that, that it needed to be tackled.

Robert Shrimsley
I thought Kemi Badenoch’s speech was very strange. I understood the positioning she was placing, of placing the Conservatives in the thick of this culture war, which she does sort of believe in herself. But I found myself thinking one of the great crises of Britain is an economic crisis, that we just have no growth. You’ve got to get that’s at the root of so much. We’re not maintaining our living standards. We can’t afford to defend ourselves, can’t afford the public spending.

And she’s standing there attacking one of the few sectors, higher education, in which Britain has some kind of global competitive advantage. (Laughter) (inaudible) because some students are leftwing. Well, really, you know, God, it wasn’t like that in my day. (Laughter) They were all conservatives when I was at uni. I mean, for God’s sake, it’s ridiculous.

Dan Thomas
That was the irony, wasn’t it? They talked about the heterodox approach to the conference and to UnHerd, which is Paul Marshall’s online media group. They talked about, you know, having a debate, bringing in different points of view.

Robert Shrimsley
They don’t believe in it at all.

Dan Thomas
Incredibly one point of view. I mean, everyone there had a very similar point of view, actually. There are a few people who were perhaps in the auditorium who were sort of raising questions, was it? But broadly speaking, we’re talking about everyone on one side here. You know, this wasn’t a multiplicity of like, different opinions in that room.

Lucy Fisher
And Dan, just weave together for listeners who aren’t familiar with Paul Marshall, kind of who he is and his role in this conference and the wider media empire and his interest in politics.

Dan Thomas
Well, first of all, he’s a very rich man. He runs Marshall Wace, which is a large hedge fund. And through that, he’s got lots of money to spend into different areas. And he’s become actually UK’s probably most prominent media baron of recent time because he’s bought The Spectator, the conservative magazine Unherd, which is this online media group which publishes works by people like Jordan Peterson.

Lucy Fisher
And GB News.

Dan Thomas
And obviously owns GB News, which were at the conference and broadcasting from the conference as well.

So through that, he has a very large centre-right leaning media empire and it’s growing all the time. So he’s got a great deal of influence and you can see him exerting that power behind the scenes to some degree. And this conference is really part of that, in my view, at least. I know that he in an interview with you, Lucy, he sort of denied that these two things were connected. But you can see that this is a sort of wider, influential sort of . . . 

Robert Shrimsley
He’s also moved ’cause I think he was, you know, once upon a time a Liberal.

Lucy Fisher
He was a Lib Dem candidate.

Robert Shrimsley
And I think one of the things that changed him was his son, who was in the pop group Mumford & Sons. So losing his place in that band and the sort of cancel culture, right?

Dan Thomas
Yeah, Winston Marshall.

Robert Shrimsley
Yeah. Which changed his view significantly.

Lucy Fisher
One sort of dose of scepticism I’d sort of place on this idea that there’s all this energy on the rise is that it felt to me still that this was very much a fringe event.

And speaking to Luke Tryl there, the executive director of the More In Common think-tank, who had a stall at the conference, was watching a lot of it unfold. You know, he also made this point that it felt very online, a lot of the cultural talking points that they were picking up and also very, what he called, US-coded, red-pilled. And in some ways that is a bit of a cul-de-sac, isn’t it, for the vast majority of voters, Robert, who care about, you know, education, healthcare, the economy, cost of living.

Robert Shrimsley
Well, it may be. I mean, online has been shown to matter. So it’s pertinent. And also, I mean, this was partly fringe because I think it was very expensive to attend this conference, which is a fact. I mean, hilariously, Douglas Murray was also on stage complaining about it being in the Docklands. How if you come to London instead, there’s lots of nice things to see. Clearly got offended having to go so far east.

But I think the fundamental point of this: can the right craft a grand theory about what is wrong with British society as is happening elsewhere? Can you spin this whole story around extreme progressive views which have wrecked society, destroyed the economy, committed the country to an energy policy that’s disastrous, undermining the core values, mass immigration? If you can start spinning that all together and tie it up with a ribbon, which I can certainly see how they could, then you’ve got quite a potent force. And I think to disregard it, because as yet, it’s not getting 50 per cent in the polls, I think is dangerous.

Lucy Fisher
To play devil’s advocate. I mean, I asked a senior Labour official this week whether they were worried about this cultural vibe shift on the right or whether they were cock-a-hoop at the right going down what might be something of a cul-de-sac electorally. And they sort of dismissed it. They said . . . 

Robert Shrimsley
But they’re copying it. Why can’t they (inaudible).

Lucy Fisher
I mean, this particular person made the point that they thought that Farage and Badenoch were they’re talking up family values and so forth in order to pitch to donors who were there. There was a very wealthy subset of the attendees, and they think that it’s not a kind of a full-time shift for either party. It’s a . . . 

Dan Thomas
(Overlapping speech) Place the international (inaudible) of the far right place the Washington as well. You know, Farage is in Washington, as we know, all too often, but probably come from various constituents.

Robert Shrimsley
I accept all of your caveats. I accept all of the reasons why this could be wrong, but I just put it back to you: what is actually happening in British politics when we have a Labour government, which is completely resiling from deeper engagement with Europe, which is now posting videos of the people it’s deporting, which is apparently shelving its gender recognition plans, which is increasingly running scared with the very agenda that these people are putting through.

So even if they don’t win, they’re winning some of these arguments in terms of the political realm. So the idea that Labour is not taking them seriously I just don’t think stands up, particularly if you look at some things that are coming out of their political cabinet a week ago. They’re very scared.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah. And maybe they looked at what happened to the Democrats in America and thought they lost that election partly on woke and we’re not gonna make the same mistake here.

Dan Thomas
The one thing I thought at the conference itself, which was perhaps it wouldn’t play well with the broader voters, was the Christian theme. And I spoke to several people, and it was the end of day two, who were pretty consistently saying, how much do people care in this country . . . 

Robert Shrimsley
Judeo-Christians I’ll have you know. (Laughter)

Dan Thomas
Well indeed. But how does that play with the voters? I mean, how people vote on faith — I know that’s the question which I couldn’t quite get to . . . 

Gideon Rachman
Alastair Campbell said, “We don’t do God.” (Laughter)

Robert Shrimsley
But again, it’s about constructing a dragon to slay. And you’re clearly right that, you know, Britain does not welcome, you know, one-nation-under-God-dery in terms of its politics. It doesn’t mean that people who are overly evangelists.

But if you can say all of the cultures and all of the values that you just take for granted are under threat, that’s a different argument and that’s . . . It’s a much more powerful one which can pull in people. You must all find this, I’m constantly struck by now how often I come across people who will tell me they think they’re gonna vote Reform, and I don’t think it’s just my dinner circle crowd.

Lucy Fisher
(Laughter) That could be, Robert.

Robert Shrimsley
That wouldn’t have happened five or six years ago. People are openly talking about how they like Farage and are ready to vote Reform — people you wouldn’t expect to be saying that, so . . . 

Lucy Fisher
I must just pick up. There was a rather amusing moment at the conference where Jordan Peterson was in conversation with Nigel Farage. I don’t think he was entirely read up on his private life and said, you know, Nigel, don’t you agree that the most important organisational principle for society is the committed, stable, heterosexual, monogamous, child-centred marriage? And you could see Farage (sound of clearing throat) sort of . . . 

Gideon Rachman
Well, he made a joke about it.

Lucy Fisher
He swallows, and I may not be the best person to comment on that.

Nigel Farage in audio clip
Well, I may not necessarily be the best advocate for monogamous heterosexuality or stable marriage, having been having been divorced twice.

Robert Shrimsley
Watching Nigel Farage’s face — I was in the hall for that interview session — and Nigel Farage looking to . . . What have I wandered into? (Laughter)

Dan Thomas
He was the most normal person there. That’s extraordinary.

Lucy Fisher
There were some pretty controversial people on the line-up as well as kind of very mainstream politicians. And one that struck me was Konstantin Kisin, who was a headliner just a day after a controversy erupted over his suggestion that Rishi Sunak, the British ex-prime minister born and bred in Southampton, could not be considered English because he is, and I quote, a brown Hindu. I mean, Gideon, that’s just quite straightforward ethno-nationalism, no?

Gideon Rachman
Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think . . . I didn’t see the full clip. Of course, that didn’t stop me immediately thinking about it. But Kisin’s defence was that he was making this old distinction between British, which is a non-ethnic sort of portfolio term, and English, etc. But I think the trouble . . . 

Lucy Fisher
Do you buy that?

Gideon Rachman
Not really, no. Well, maybe in his own mind — I don’t know what’s in his mind — but I think the trouble is that if you pair it with the fact that this is a guy who bangs on about the dangers of mass immigration all the time, it stops being a sort of interesting debate about is there a distinction between English and British. And he is saying this prime minister of Britain is not English, who was born and raised in England.

Robert Shrimsley
He waited to meet Kemi Badenoch.

Gideon Rachman
Well, absolutely. Yeah. And so, yeah, I mean, there’s no other way of seeing it other than as a form of ethno-nationalism.

And I think that is kind of threatening to a lot of us, you know, that . . . I was just back from Germany, and I’d been talking to a prominent German diplomat, and he was saying that, you know, in his family when he grew up, because of the Nazi era, people really didn’t want to talk about, like, where were your origins? Where were you born? Because, as he pointed out you couldn’t join the SS unless you proved that you had German-Aryan ancestry going back seven generations.

Now, Kisin is some way from that, but he’s introducing those sorts of things. Well, who’s English, who isn’t? And it really it’s about blood isn’t it? It’s about ethnicity. And that, I think, is it’s not a debate that we’ve had in England and I’m glad we haven’t.

Lucy Fisher
It is turning a corner, Robert, from most of the campaigners on the right against mass migration who say the issue here is a failure of multiculturalism or of people who have migrated to the UK to integrate, rather than that they don’t have the right ethnic make-up.

Robert Shrimsley
Although, I mean, I speak cause my grandparents migrated to this country. So I listen to this and find myself thinking, well, what am I? Am I British? Once upon a time, the argument with immigration was you came to this country, you adopted the values, your children are British. British, English, whatever.

But I mean, I think that what we’re seeing, we see it increasingly, is people in the spectrum of the right to the Conservative party and Reform, you’ll hear them talking about white British, the percentage of white British in London, or the percentage of white Christian in London ’cause actually, Christianity is hanging on, not least because of all the immigrants from Africa in terms of percentage of observant people.

And you find you’re thinking, well, why the focus on white British? You know, are the descendants of the Windrush generation not British in your mind? What are you telling us here? That only people, you know, who can find their names in the Domesday Book have a right to this full respect?

Gideon Rachman
Sure. And that reminds me, I for my sins go to England football matches. And I remember talking to a far-right guy who said — we’re talking about an England-Brazil game and England won 2-0 — so we only really won 1-0, because John Barnes scored one of the goals and he’s black.

Lucy Fisher
Oh my God.

Gideon Rachman
And that’s the route we’re going down. He’s not really English. Yeah.

Dan Thomas
It’s not so long ago, is it, really, if you think about it.

Robert Shrimsley
I mean, there is . . . Just to be slightly fair to Konstantin Kisin, I’ve known him quite a long time. There is an interesting argument, and one I’ve had about myself, which is if England doesn’t exist as a legal legislative entity, there is no parliament for England. Then if your identity, your citizenship is British, until England exists as a legal and legislative identity, then English is an ethnicity.

And I know plenty of people who are immigrants or immigrant descent who consider themselves English, and plenty people who go, no, I’m British. And the only time you really feel, no, I’m English, is perhaps when you go to Scotland. (Laughter)

Gideon Rachman
Or indeed, watch the England football team, which is probably one of the few sort of unifying English things.

Lucy Fisher
Dan, final word to you on this, obviously you cover all things media around the world, but where do you see this kind of rightwing movement going?

Dan Thomas
Well, it’s fascinating, isn’t it, because you can see, particularly in the US clearly, because as Robert was saying, you know, Trump is in many ways influencing a great deal of influence over what the US media now covers. And the ones that are fighting back are finding their lives more and more difficult.

So you can see that world is becoming more and more testing, I think, for independent and normalised media. So you can see the shift towards the right over there. It’s difficult to say.

I mean, like, you know, some of those things that were coming out in the conference around DEI policies, for example. People really didn’t like the idea about DEI. Lots of people were saying that there’s a good thing that Trump was taking these, dogeing these, you know, these policies over in the US.

You can see those things are actually becoming now more acceptable to say. And because of that, you’ll find the press as well reflecting these things more and more. So I think, you know, I think the Trump aspects of those are increasingly influential in how the press is covering.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Lucy Fisher
We’ve just got time left for Political Fix stock picks. Robert, who are you buying or selling this week?

Robert Shrimsley
OK. With some trepidation and no originality whatsoever, I’m actually going to buy Keir Starmer, because I think one of the potential makings of a prime minister is a crisis. When things happen that shocks from outside, which allow you to reset a narrative, which allow you to say I’m on top of this and I look like a prime minister, don’t I, voters? That’s an opportunity.

Now, for the reasons we discussed earlier, there are all kinds of ways it could still go badly wrong for him, but it’s an opportunity for him to stamp himself on the country and say, I’m standing up for what we’re about and I’m right and don’t you agree with me? So even though it could all go wrong, I’m gonna buy Starmer.

Lucy Fisher
Gideon?

Gideon Rachman
So I’m gonna buy somebody I met for the first time this week. It was a young Lib Dem MP, guy called Mike Martin, who I think won Tunbridge Wells for the first time in a century from when the Tories didn’t hold it. And he’s a smart person and I could see him having a good future in British politics if the Lib Dems have a future. He’s ex-army officer, understands national security, youngish, quite good looking, articulate. And so yeah, I think he could do well.

Robert Shrimsley
What about you, Lucy?

Lucy Fisher
Well, we’ve been discussing the Spectator, so I’m buying its new-ish editor, Michael Gove, the former Tory cabinet minister. As we’ve reported, he’s on Rishi Sunak’s resignation honours list, so he might also be going to the House of Lords soon too.

But I’ve been interested in how he’s using the magazine, and in particular this week has launched a big initiative pointing out frivolous funding by the government. And often, it must be said, during the time in which he was in the cabinet and serving in the UK administration. But he’s very good at seizing the agenda, and I think there is a wider push on the right foot to sort of call for a UK-style Doge unit or movement.

Dan, how about you?

Dan Thomas
I will, just because we saw him this week, I’ll go with Nigel Farage. I’m sure you’ve had before, but only because I thought he handled the question from Jordan Peterson over his own family incredibly well. Like I said, he came across as very human, very normal on the stage or in a crowd, which sometimes could be the other way. So I think he had a pretty good weekend.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Lucy Fisher
Great. Well, that’s all we’ve got time for. Robert Shrimsley, Dan Thomas and Gideon Rachman, thanks for joining.

Gideon Rachman
Thank you, Lucy.

Robert Shrimsley
Cheers, Lucy.

Dan Thomas
Thanks so much.

Hello, I’m Lucy Fisher, and this is Political Fix from the Financial Times. Welcome. Coming up: Keir Starmer is set to head to the White House next week. But is he the man to save 80 years of Pax Americana? Plus, exporting the spirit of Maga. Jordan Peterson voice clip
You’re the men and women, individuals made in the image of God who stumble eternally uphill towards the Jerusalem on the hill, the shining city on the hill. Lucy Fisher
The rightwing psychologist Jordan Peterson there, speaking at the Arc conference in London this week. It was part megachurch, part political rally promoting American-style Christian values in the UK. But will it catch on this side of the pond? It’s been another dramatic week of world-shaking interventions from Donald Trump, who, lest we forget, has only been in office a month so far. To dissect the latest and throw ahead to the important period of diplomacy in coming weeks, I’m joined by Political Fix regular Robert Shrimsley. Hi, Robert. Robert Shrimsley
Hi, Lucy. Lucy Fisher
And the FT’s chief foreign affairs commentator Gideon Rachman. Hi, Gideon. Gideon Rachman
Hello, Lucy. Lucy Fisher
Plus, the FT’s defence editor John Paul Rathbone. Hi, JP. John Paul Rathbone Hello, Lucy.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Lucy Fisher
So Gideon, take us through the big moments of the week. Trump has called Zelenskyy a dictator. He’s claimed Ukraine started the war and he’s kicked off US-Russia talks about the future of Ukraine without Kyiv being present. Gideon Rachman
Yeah, absolutely. And I think it all started actually at the Munich Security Conference with the speech by Vice-President Vance saying that European governments were more of a threat to democracy in Europe than Russia. And it’s all kind of gone steadily downhill from there. And I think that’s what’s dawning on Europeans at different rates and at Brits at different rates is that in significant ways, America is now an adversary. It’s not just an unreliable ally. It’s actually trying to undermine democracy in Europe. The Trump administration, I have to say, feels closer to Putin’s Russia than it does to the EU. I’m afraid that is the situation. And that’s my interpretation. Not everybody buys that. And one of the things that I find really fascinating is trying to figure out what does actually the British government think. I mean, I picked up from some people kind of in official positions. The adversary word was first used to me by someone who is kind of inner circle. So there are people who think like that. Whether that goes all the way up to the cabinet, all the way to Keir Starmer, they would deny, deny, deny in public. I think in private they’re beginning to think it. Lucy Fisher
Well, that is really striking. I mean, Robert, is that your take? Robert Shrimsley
Broadly, I mean, the phrase I hear consistently is amoral, that they’re not used to having to deal with a president they regard as completely amoral on the major issues of freedom and democracy. And it is something they are deeply shocked about. And what was it? They thought they’d prepared for the worst with Trump and that looks even worse. I mean, after the JD Vance I was talking to somebody who was at the Munich conference who described JD Vance’s gaslighting speech, described it as like watching a, if you’ll excuse the language, a pissed Rangers fan goading Celtic supporters. And they were really shocked about it. And yet, on the other hand, there are people on the right in Britain who picked this up, as we may discuss. I think the government is deeply unsure how to deal with Trump. It had this notion of we can navigate, we can weave between Europe and the US. And every day now there is something that somebody in the British government is looking at and thinking, I don’t know if we can sustain this. Lucy Fisher
JP, you’ve obviously monitored the shockwaves this has sent through European capitals about what it means for the potential removal or unreliability of the US security guarantee. Tell us a bit about what is being planned across Europe if the US can no longer be relied on. John Paul Rathbone
So it’s all been a kick in the gender-neutral cojones, right? And it’s been really interesting to see Europe I think it’s fair to say spring into action or wake up. This past week we had meetings in Paris thinking about what to do about Ukraine. There’s more of the same. There seems to be a nascent plan cooked up by France and the UK about how to approach Ukraine should the US seal a deal with Russia. And that’s interesting how they’re thinking about that. And then also this week you had Denmark all of a sudden boosting its defence spending to 3 per cent of GDP. So there is reaction across a lot of Europe. Not all of it. Southern Europe is in a different place, but it’s definitely the snooze button hasn’t been pressed on the alarm clock this time. Gideon Rachman
Yeah. No. And I think that, you know, again, the interesting conversations at Munich with Europeans, as most Brits who are thinking about this; some of the most influential ones I spoke to I think can see the direction of travel very clearly. But they’re playing for time because they know that rupture with the US, an open rupture now, may be unavoidable, but if it was like, to happen tomorrow or next week, you know, Article 5 is obviously no longer applicable or America pulls its troops out, we’re very underprepared. You know, we don’t have the stuff we can put in place. I say we, I’m talking about Europe, to replace American troops and also equipment, heavy lift, etc, all of that stuff. So ideally we need like five years. We may not get five years, but we’re getting to prepare for that date. And they’re hoping just as like, delay that the evil moment. Robert Shrimsley
And can I just ask, one of the things that was put to me by somebody trying to analyse what Trump’s been doing in the last week is that actually he arrives, he thinks he’s going to deliver peace really quickly. There’s a Nobel Peace Prize out there with his name on it. He comes up with a plan, and he’s actually a bit shocked to find the degree of rebuff both from Ukraine and from parts of Europe. And what you’re seeing is less a sort of a co-ordinated, strategic way of thinking towards Russia and that actually just this has gone the wrong way and I’m lashing out at the people who are sabotaging. You don’t buy this or you do? Gideon Rachman
No, I don’t. I mean, I think he’s basically sympathetic to Russia. I mean, and I think that, you know, everybody saw the way this was going. I mean, in the sense that the game that both the Russians and the Ukrainians and the Europeans are playing is he’s a narcissist. Don’t say anything bad about him. And the Ukrainians were hoping that it would be the Russians who would first kind of pissed him off. So they didn’t, like, walk into this. But at a certain point, when he calls your leader (inaudible), there’s not much you can do, really. I mean, I think probably the Russians played him very well. I mean, JP, you cover the intelligence world, but I remember an intelligence person once said to me that the easiest person to manipulate and bring over to your side is a narcissist, because you know what to say. You say things like people underestimate you. You don’t get the credit you deserve. Let’s do this thing together. We can break the rules. And they’ve got a whole playbook when they encounter a narcissist. And Putin is a former intelligence officer and they’re playing it by the numbers. I mean, right down to saying you won the 2020 election. I mean, you know. Lucy Fisher
Well, it’s certainly striking, isn’t it, that Trump is explicitly repeating Russian talking points in the way he’s describing Ukraine. Gideon, the initial fear among European allies was that Trump would withdraw material support from Ukraine. Is your assessment we should now view it as him flipping sides to almost back Russia in this? Gideon Rachman
Well, I mean it’s got a little way to go, but I mean, it’s certainly, as you say, he’s adopted Russia’s talking points pretty much wholesale. And I think that I don’t know what will happen next because Trump is so deeply unpredictable. But I think we can say where his instincts lie. I don’t think there’ll be any more aid to Ukraine, and that could mean that they’re in some trouble on the battlefield and financially quite quickly. Lucy Fisher
So Robert, Starmer jets out to the White House next week. His team are still talking up this idea of him being this great bridge between Washington and the rest of Europe. I speak to some in government who think that this is a great opportunity for him to sort of seize where there’s a vacuum of leadership in Europe with the likes of Schultz on the way out, Macron on the way out, and he can kind of step into that role. What do you make of that? Robert Shrimsley
I don’t . . . I find this quite hard to understand, assuming, first of all, that they want a bridge to the EU. I mean, I would have thought that if you were looking for somebody within the European firmament to play that role, that someone like Giorgia Meloni was a better bet personally, as someone who’d be much more agreeable to Trump. I just don’t think that America’s looking for that intermediary role, it’s quite capable of speaking for itself. I think there are things that Britain can and should be doing, and there is clearly a role within Europe, a leadership role to be taken in terms of thinking about the defence of Europe. Clearly, the UK’s placed itself outside the European Union doesn’t help. You have a number of weak leaders, as you say, although by next week we will understand who’s leading Germany and that will change the calculation. But I think everybody . . . I mean, I was at a sort of think-tank on Monday, a policy exchange, a sort of Tory-leaning think-tank where HR McMaster, who I think had a year as Trump’s national security adviser last time, was speaking. And even he, when I look back at what he said only on Monday, has clearly been shocked by the way things have turned out, because he was talking about an axis of aggression of Russia and China and Iran together and you can’t take your foot off Russia’s throat too much and Trump will come to understand this. So I think even people within America’s foreign policy firmament are being completely shocked by the way things are evolving. Gideon Rachman
Yeah. I mean, I think just one way of understanding it, a friend of mine in Washington put it is that Trump’s main project is the destruction of liberalism in America. And in that sense, he regards the EU as part of that liberal firmament that he’s trying to take on and destroy. They espouse the same values. The personal connections are deep, the institutional connections are deep. So in that sense, it’s not that surprising that they want to take on the EU because it’s part of the opposition. Robert Shrimsley
I mean, just to come back to your original question about the role that Britain can play. I mean, there is something up for grabs. You know, one should be pretty sceptical whether it’s there. But, you know, if Starmer can go to the US and comes away with Trump taking a slightly different position towards Ukraine, taking something much more towards the classic position that Europe would like, well, then he’s come away with something substantial. If the fact that he offered troops when others didn’t gets him a more favourable hearing. I mean, there is the potential that I just think one has to be sceptical about how far you can go with this, but there is something to play for at least. Lucy Fisher
JP, I’m also interested that, you know, Starmer, as Robert pointed out, has been very forthright in saying he is ready and willing to put British troops on the ground in Ukraine. That’s been kind of walked back a bit by defence insiders who are trying to sort of emphasise, you know, our superiority as a country in air power. The suggestion by western officials that we might be looking at something more like a reassurance force of far fewer troops, about 30,000-odd troops in Ukraine away from the front line, rather than 100,000-odd lining that line of contact. Tell us about that. John Paul Rathbone
So first, on the Starmer coming out saying we want to put boots on the ground, which was a very unequivocal statement from someone who is patently cautious, made me think perhaps there’s something that he has already begun to discuss with the United States that, I don’t know, open question mark. Second, on the way they’re thinking about a force in Ukraine, a peacekeeping force that would monitor or rather enforce the ceasefire, the initial thought was 100,000 troops, or is that actually 50,000 troops, which would just be a drop in the ocean in a country as big as Ukraine with a 1,000km front line. And the one area where the west has an edge and that Putin is afraid of is air power, and that includes the air forces of France and the UK. But, you know, it’s the US that is the big gorilla with all those F-35s. And then, of course, there’s a tricky question which occurs to me now is about permissioning. What if the US says, hmm, all that US kit in Europe, well, actually we’ve decided you can’t use it in Ukraine. I don’t know how far that goes and how much that toggle switches on, off. There might be degrees. Gideon Rachman
Yeah. It’s a really interesting debate because I think as Europe begins to take this new view of America, Trump is gonna be demanding we buy more American weaponry to close the trade deficit. But it begins to look like a security risk if you can’t rely on the Americans. I mean, so the Danes, in the hypothetical thing that they were in a fight over Greenland, that all their planes are F-35s and they happen to think, well, could America somehow, is there an off switch somewhere in there? Is there a back door that it could be in operation? Lucy Fisher
And it’s a question mark for the UK’s nuclear deterrent as well, isn’t it, which is operationally independent but relies very much on the US for ongoing maintenance of the warheads? John Paul Rathbone
Exactly. So, you know, it’s how long it is that before you need to maintain a nuclear missile? Yeah. But I’d have thought it’d be a very bad deal if, you know, tens, hundreds of billions of future defence contracts, suddenly Europe says, actually, no, thanks very much. Gideon Rachman
Yeah, sure. But that implies that, yeah, that the Americans have thought it through. You know, I think that they’re so confident, they’re so hubristic at the moment. I don’t think it even occurs to them that we might do that. In fact, it was interesting I bumped into an American friend who’s now become an arms dealer for one of the American manufacturers in Munich, and I set up a parley because I was pissed off at the time both at the Vance speech; said, you know, you should prepare yourself that Europeans are gonna not buy your stuff if you’re going like this. And she sort of laughed, you know. They don’t believe it. Lucy Fisher
Robert, what about UK defence spending, because the backdrop against, you know, Starmer’s quite hawkish talk is still that they haven’t sort of publicly signed off when they’re going to get to 2.5 per cent of GDP. We know that the military chiefs marched into Downing Street — admittedly, invited by the prime minister last week, I should add (laughter) — to ask for it to go up to 2.65 per cent of GDP; you know, got a comprehensive spending review going on where departments are having to make or identify least cuts. It’s not easy to square the circle. Robert Shrimsley
It isn’t easy to square the circle under the current fiscal rules and the tax constraints that Labour has signed up to. I mean, I think it was very telling that it’s often the case that the first breach between the prime minister and the chancellor is over defence because the Treasury never wants to spend money on defence. And it’s one of those areas where the military can go straight to the prime minister and talk them round. And so it’s interesting that we’re hearing talk about this again. I mean, I don’t think even 2.65 is going to cut it, but . . . And the government doesn’t have any money so it’s gonna have to find ways . . .  Lucy Fisher
What’s it gonna . . . What do you think they’ll do? Robert Shrimsley
Well, I mean the answer is I don’t know. I’ve heard talk of extending the freeze on tax thresholds right through to the end of the parliament, which also buys Rachel Reeves a little bit of fiscal wiggle room on her rules. My own view has been for a while that the logical responses to these significantly changed circumstances is to say we’re going to have a defence levy, rather, as Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson tried to do with health and social care. Say, look, we’re in a different world. We have to able to defend ourselves. We didn’t expect to have to put this tax on, but we’re going to do it. And I think by far and away the best thing in these circumstances as a political figure, is to level with the public rather than try to pretend that you’re not doing it or find sneaky ways or breach explicit manifesto commitments just to ‘fess up and say, look, the world has changed. We need to be able to defend ourselves against this threat. We’re going to raise this levy. Do I think they’ll do it? I don’t know. It strikes me as a bit too brave, but it feels like the right way to go. Lucy Fisher
Yeah. I’m inclined to agree, but I mean, JP, that would require a feat of storytelling that is not Starmer or his main allies in the cabinet’s strength. And it’s a huge leap in the narrative that the government has told the public heretofore about our defences papering over all the cracks for many, many years now. John Paul Rathbone
Well, two things: you can either say we’re gonna stick to our fiscal rules or you can say, well, we’re actually gonna have to cut our armed forces at a time when Europe is more under threat than ever. And I wonder which story is better or least bad, because capabilities would have to be cut at 2.3 per cent. And you can say, well, actually we’re going to have nukes and but we’re gonna have to cut X, Y, Z. And enough politicians have been saying for a long time how hollowed out the British forces are. I don’t think it will come as any surprise. And second of all, I’m surprised how little political capital, how it hasn’t become a political issue. There’s $300bn worth of Russian assets sitting inside Europe. And I think a chunk of that is inside the UK. And everyone in Europe is saying there’s no money, but there is. And of course, this has profound implications for Euroclear and all of that. Lucy Fisher
Euroclear being . . .  John Paul Rathbone
The Belgium clearing office where a lot of this money is. But I think some of it is also in the UK and that money is just sitting there. If we really are at war with Russia, why not? Lucy Fisher
Go ahead and seize it? What are the key arguments against that, Gideon? People say it goes against sort of property rights. It could have a chill effect on inward investment to the UK and wider EU. Gideon Rachman
Yeah, all of that and yeah, that we rely on the rule of law and that other countries that think that they might one day be it have a — ‘cause we’re not actually at war with Russia. John Paul Rathbone
That’s debatable. Gideon Rachman
. . . have a conflict with us would be worried about putting their money into Britain and the City’s really important. I mean, China, for example, might hesitate. Robert Shrimsley
It’s a strong argument as well. Gideon Rachman
Yeah. Lucy Fisher
But JP, what you say is interesting. You know, it’s debatable whether the UK is at war because you and I speak to people in the MoD, you far more than me, who do view the UK at war with Russia in a kind of hybrid or grey zone sense. John Paul Rathbone
So Russia is doing warlike things to the UK. It is below the so-called threshold of war but, you know, there are assassination attempts, there is sabotage, there are bombs on DHL planes that fortunately haven’t gone off. There are spies doing all sorts of nefarious stuff. So in the Russian view, you know, war is a spectrum. It’s not an on/off switch. It’s not black and white. It’s shades of grey. And there’s definitely stuff that Russia is doing that counts as warlike — not enough to trigger Article 5 . . .  Gideon Rachman
Of course they would, I mean . . .  John Paul Rathbone
It’s all deniable, of course. Gideon Rachman
And also they would say we’re doing the same because we’ve given Ukraine missiles that have been hitting them. I mean, I’m not justifying their actions, but that’s how wars start, I guess. Lucy Fisher
So to wrap up, I mean, the fact we’re sitting here talking about the US as a potential adversary to the UK, to the rest of Europe, I mean, this is a strategic shock on a par with what, Suez? Gideon Rachman
Oh, far bigger than that. Lucy Fisher
Far bigger than that. 9/11. Gideon Rachman
Yeah. I mean, I think it’s the biggest . . . Look, I hope I look back on this podcast in a year’s time and think, oh, I really lost the plot, completely hysterical. (Lucy laughs) And it was like, not as bad. But if you had to ask me what I honestly think, I think we’re witnessing the breakdown of the postwar order that goes all the way back to the foundation of Nato in ‘49. Whether Nato is formally dead or not, I don’t know, but I think that the transatlantic alliance is collapsing fast. And is this a permanent thing? I think as long as Trump’s around, it’s permanent. I retain the hope that Trump will implode and a more normal America will reappear. But even then, it’s gonna be a job for them to regain the lost confidence from what’s just happening right now. Lucy Fisher
Robert. Robert Shrimsley
Yeah. I mean, I think it’s a deeply uncomfortable and frightening period for Europe in which the good scenario is that American commitment is only weakened rather than removed. It is genuinely very alarming. The only things one could say in terms of trying to keep your head about this is things change in the world. Diplomatic scenarios change. America’s attitude towards its erstwhile allies could change again because things move on. Equally, one has to keep some sense of perspective about Russia. It is not strong at the moment, militarily. It’s gonna take Russia a while to rebuild from what’s happened in Ukraine as well. So I don’t . . . I mean, I’d be certainly very frightened if I lived in Estonia, but I think if you live in Britain, there are reasons not to lose your head entirely. But it is tell . . . This is the clear point that Europe has got to learn to fend for itself. And it’s really, really got to pay attention to this now. Lucy Fisher
JP, final word to you. John Paul Rathbone
I’m sort of anti-catastrophising and the sense of American withdrawal from Europe has been here for a while and European defence types were talking about it under Biden. But this just definitely seems to be like a hammer taken to the edifice. But there is time, as Robert said. You know, Russia had, at best, would take five years to reconstitute its military. Lucy Fisher
We’ll have to get you back on as events develop. JP, thanks for joining. John Paul Rathbone
Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Lucy Fisher
Trump’s return to the white House is having not only major geopolitical ramifications, but a seismic cultural impact. The Maga movement is thriving and that’s created tailwinds for some right-leaning and alt-right figures in the wider west. This week, a major three-day conference dubbed “the rightwing Davos” took place in London. To discuss it, Robert and Gideon are still with us, but we’re now joined as well in the studio by Daniel Thomas, the FT’s global media editor. Hi, Dan. Dan Thomas
Hi. Lucy Fisher
So, Dan, you, Robert and me are all schlepped down to the Excel Centre in east London to take in the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship event, or so-called Arc conference, this week. This sounds like a straightforward question, but I think it’s less so than on the face of it. Can you explain what Arc is? Dan Thomas
An incredibly good question and as you say, quite difficult to summarise. So yeah, the three-day conference encapsulated so many different themes, right? We had Christian morality right to the front. You had all these ideas around the family and the idea that families should have more babies. And the pro-birthers were there, very much so. The net zero was heavily to the fore as well. So there were all these different sort of like neoconservative, almost like verging on fringe conservative, rightwing thinking coming through there, which is fascinating. But at the same time there’s some overlays there, particularly on the Christian side, which I was so surprised about. Lucy Fisher
Yeah. And so Robert, we had politicians from the American right. We had Trump’s new energy secretary, Chris Wright. We had the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson; on the UK side, Kemi Badenoch, Nigel Farage, and all sorts of cultural figures like the controversial psychologist Jordan Peterson, who’s one of the founders. We’ll get on to some of the politics of it. But just tell me what your impressions were of it. Robert Shrimsley I thought it was a very strange sort of event, because I’ve been to Reform party rallies. I’ve been to lots of what you’d call rightwing events in Britain. This was something I thought very different, because the faith infusion was so central to it. It was like sort of this double cult. You had the rightwing politics part and you had the faith part, and the faith part is really right in front of you. I don’t mean mostly, it’s not like evangelical preachers. This wasn’t some Billy Graham stuff. But it’s just absolutely central, like the writing in a stick of rock, to what was going on.  And everywhere, it was all about Judeo-Christian values this and Judeo-Christian values that. And it was an attempt to say, we’ve got to reformulate our thinking and our thinking in the west. And one of the people actually said, going back to, you know, the original manual, which is the Bible, and that is the sort of the rock on which we build it forward.  And the other thing I was very struck by through it all is this sense of crisis which infuses all of the conversations, you know, from Douglas Murray and Niall Ferguson and Jordan Peterson, who was much more of a crisis-monger than I’d ever really understood, I think, before; talking about the climate scam and the dangers of homosexuality. It was quite a thing.  And I thought this sense of crisis is one of the things that is really happening in the right and particularly the Maga-fied right. Look at the issues that they talk about, you know — the falling birth rate, questions around free speech, some of the issues around net zero, around mass immigration.  So yeah, these are all issues. These are all things you’ve to think about. But are these actually the great terminal moral crisis which you are portraying them as being? And I think it’s that doominess that makes this such a strange gathering. Lucy Fisher
Yes, you’re right. This idea of a civilisation, western civilisation, being at a tipping point . . .  Robert Shrimsley
Well, they called it a civilisational moment. Lucy Fisher
They do. We’ll talk more about the conference, but Gideon, from your perspective, I mean, this was very much an Anglosphere conference. They were proud that they’d got a thousand people from the US, 300-odd from Australia and New Zealand, some from Europe, Africa, and that it’s grown from 1,500 people in its first year to 4,000 people this year. Is this kind of rise of sort of rightwing kind of cultural, political movement? Are we seeing that across the rest of Europe? Gideon Rachman Well, I think that’s certainly what Vance’s speech was, in a sense. That was the audience for Vance’s speech that we were talking about earlier. They believe that Europe’s lost its way and that the true Europe is represented by parties like the AfD in Germany or Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz, etc. And that in a way, the completion of their American Maga revolution is, I mean, people like Musk talk about saving the west.  So it’s not like they’re . . . You know, in some sense they do care about Europe, but they look at Europe I think in a very distorted way, but with horror and say, you know, it’s got to get back and embrace all these things — Christianity, natalism, mass immigration and you know, that’s got to end and are they flirting with expelling people? I think they are.  So those kinds of ideas are basically a Maga-isation of Europe and Orbán, when he was president of the European Council for a while, adopted the slogan Make Europe Great Again. So it’s an attempt to kind of say Trump has shown the way and this is the way that Europe should move. Robert Shrimsley And what made Arc unusual, I thought, I don’t know what you’d guess. I mean, it was this strange combination of lots of the usual Maga crowd and the usual rightwing characters and Douglas Murray’s, but also some genuinely quite thoughtful people. Admittedly thoughtful people from a particular faith-based perspective, but thoughtful, interesting, trying to set out different positions. Paul Marshall, who owns The Spectator and is, I think, a man of faith talking about energy policy and describing net zero policies like unilateral disarmament. Why is Britain the only country pursuing this energy unilateral disarmament?  So interesting ideas being kicked around as well and somehow, that sort of always leavened at times the other parts of it. But what I’m really struck by above everything else is that all of the political energy in British and much of western policy is on the right. And in the end, I think energy often tells, but this is where all the noise, energy, excitement, debate is taking people. Gideon Rachman
But one of the things that really interests me is I think they might be split by Ukraine. I hope so. (Overlapping speech) terribly fond of them. Dan Thomas
This is pretty . . .  Robert Shrimsley
And it wasn’t much and strikingly, it was not talked about that much. Gideon Rachman No. But the really interesting thing, I saw Niall Ferguson — you know, I should say, Sir Niall Ferguson — the historian of a conservative bent, spoke at the conference. I mean, I know privately, as you know, spoken about Ukraine as a kind of the moral issue of our times.  And I would say, it’s sort of saying to myself, Niall, like, when are you gonna speak up? Because you can see the direction that Trump’s going. And he finally did. He tweeted yesterday and repudiated everything that Trump had said about Ukraine, and was rewarded with a personal rebuke on Twitter by JD Vance. Dan Thomas
It wouldn’t have gone down well in the crowd either. There was one New York-based journalist who dared to raise his voice and said, actually, you know, I don’t think Trump, I don’t think Musk adheres to Christian faith. He doesn’t look after the poor, he doesn’t look after the weak. He got booed and hissed as the one dissenting voice and that was striking. That was the one thing which the crowd didn’t like. (Overlapping speech). Robert Shrimsley
But the other point is, I mean, there’s almost a wilful blindness to the humbug of what this . . . But, I mean, if you take the Vance speech, this is a man who was vice-president to a US president who tried to cancel an election, lecturing Europe about maintaining faith in democracy. This is a man whose White House, or his boss’s White House, is expelling journalists who won’t use Trump-approved language, lecturing about free speech. This is a government that is busy carving up Ukraine, lecturing Europe about the defence of liberty. And yet all the people who supposedly hold these ideals so dear, I just thought, oh, did he? Its looking the other way. Lucy Fisher
It’s the same hypocrisy we heard from Kemi Badenoch on the stage, I think you could say, because she was talking in the same breath about the importance of free speech, but then also saying that universities were responsible for poisoning minds and the culture in the UK, and actively said, without fleshing it out, that something needed to be done about that, that it needed to be tackled. Robert Shrimsley I thought Kemi Badenoch’s speech was very strange. I understood the positioning she was placing, of placing the Conservatives in the thick of this culture war, which she does sort of believe in herself. But I found myself thinking one of the great crises of Britain is an economic crisis, that we just have no growth. You’ve got to get that’s at the root of so much. We’re not maintaining our living standards. We can’t afford to defend ourselves, can’t afford the public spending.  And she’s standing there attacking one of the few sectors, higher education, in which Britain has some kind of global competitive advantage. (Laughter) (inaudible) because some students are leftwing. Well, really, you know, God, it wasn’t like that in my day. (Laughter) They were all conservatives when I was at uni. I mean, for God’s sake, it’s ridiculous. Dan Thomas
That was the irony, wasn’t it? They talked about the heterodox approach to the conference and to UnHerd, which is Paul Marshall’s online media group. They talked about, you know, having a debate, bringing in different points of view. Robert Shrimsley
They don’t believe in it at all. Dan Thomas
Incredibly one point of view. I mean, everyone there had a very similar point of view, actually. There are a few people who were perhaps in the auditorium who were sort of raising questions, was it? But broadly speaking, we’re talking about everyone on one side here. You know, this wasn’t a multiplicity of like, different opinions in that room. Lucy Fisher
And Dan, just weave together for listeners who aren’t familiar with Paul Marshall, kind of who he is and his role in this conference and the wider media empire and his interest in politics. Dan Thomas
Well, first of all, he’s a very rich man. He runs Marshall Wace, which is a large hedge fund. And through that, he’s got lots of money to spend into different areas. And he’s become actually UK’s probably most prominent media baron of recent time because he’s bought The Spectator, the conservative magazine Unherd, which is this online media group which publishes works by people like Jordan Peterson. Lucy Fisher
And GB News. Dan Thomas And obviously owns GB News, which were at the conference and broadcasting from the conference as well.  So through that, he has a very large centre-right leaning media empire and it’s growing all the time. So he’s got a great deal of influence and you can see him exerting that power behind the scenes to some degree. And this conference is really part of that, in my view, at least. I know that he in an interview with you, Lucy, he sort of denied that these two things were connected. But you can see that this is a sort of wider, influential sort of . . .  Robert Shrimsley
He’s also moved ’cause I think he was, you know, once upon a time a Liberal. Lucy Fisher
He was a Lib Dem candidate. Robert Shrimsley
And I think one of the things that changed him was his son, who was in the pop group Mumford & Sons. So losing his place in that band and the sort of cancel culture, right? Dan Thomas
Yeah, Winston Marshall. Robert Shrimsley
Yeah. Which changed his view significantly. Lucy Fisher One sort of dose of scepticism I’d sort of place on this idea that there’s all this energy on the rise is that it felt to me still that this was very much a fringe event.  And speaking to Luke Tryl there, the executive director of the More In Common think-tank, who had a stall at the conference, was watching a lot of it unfold. You know, he also made this point that it felt very online, a lot of the cultural talking points that they were picking up and also very, what he called, US-coded, red-pilled. And in some ways that is a bit of a cul-de-sac, isn’t it, for the vast majority of voters, Robert, who care about, you know, education, healthcare, the economy, cost of living. Robert Shrimsley
Well, it may be. I mean, online has been shown to matter. So it’s pertinent. And also, I mean, this was partly fringe because I think it was very expensive to attend this conference, which is a fact. I mean, hilariously, Douglas Murray was also on stage complaining about it being in the Docklands. How if you come to London instead, there’s lots of nice things to see. Clearly got offended having to go so far east. But I think the fundamental point of this: can the right craft a grand theory about what is wrong with British society as is happening elsewhere? Can you spin this whole story around extreme progressive views which have wrecked society, destroyed the economy, committed the country to an energy policy that’s disastrous, undermining the core values, mass immigration? If you can start spinning that all together and tie it up with a ribbon, which I can certainly see how they could, then you’ve got quite a potent force. And I think to disregard it, because as yet, it’s not getting 50 per cent in the polls, I think is dangerous. Lucy Fisher
To play devil’s advocate. I mean, I asked a senior Labour official this week whether they were worried about this cultural vibe shift on the right or whether they were cock-a-hoop at the right going down what might be something of a cul-de-sac electorally. And they sort of dismissed it. They said . . .  Robert Shrimsley
But they’re copying it. Why can’t they (inaudible). Lucy Fisher
I mean, this particular person made the point that they thought that Farage and Badenoch were they’re talking up family values and so forth in order to pitch to donors who were there. There was a very wealthy subset of the attendees, and they think that it’s not a kind of a full-time shift for either party. It’s a . . .  Dan Thomas
(Overlapping speech) Place the international (inaudible) of the far right place the Washington as well. You know, Farage is in Washington, as we know, all too often, but probably come from various constituents. Robert Shrimsley I accept all of your caveats. I accept all of the reasons why this could be wrong, but I just put it back to you: what is actually happening in British politics when we have a Labour government, which is completely resiling from deeper engagement with Europe, which is now posting videos of the people it’s deporting, which is apparently shelving its gender recognition plans, which is increasingly running scared with the very agenda that these people are putting through.  So even if they don’t win, they’re winning some of these arguments in terms of the political realm. So the idea that Labour is not taking them seriously I just don’t think stands up, particularly if you look at some things that are coming out of their political cabinet a week ago. They’re very scared. Gideon Rachman
Yeah. And maybe they looked at what happened to the Democrats in America and thought they lost that election partly on woke and we’re not gonna make the same mistake here. Dan Thomas
The one thing I thought at the conference itself, which was perhaps it wouldn’t play well with the broader voters, was the Christian theme. And I spoke to several people, and it was the end of day two, who were pretty consistently saying, how much do people care in this country . . .  Robert Shrimsley Judeo-Christians I’ll have you know. (Laughter)  Dan Thomas
Well indeed. But how does that play with the voters? I mean, how people vote on faith — I know that’s the question which I couldn’t quite get to . . .  Gideon Rachman
Alastair Campbell said, “We don’t do God.” (Laughter) Robert Shrimsley But again, it’s about constructing a dragon to slay. And you’re clearly right that, you know, Britain does not welcome, you know, one-nation-under-God-dery in terms of its politics. It doesn’t mean that people who are overly evangelists.  But if you can say all of the cultures and all of the values that you just take for granted are under threat, that’s a different argument and that’s . . . It’s a much more powerful one which can pull in people. You must all find this, I’m constantly struck by now how often I come across people who will tell me they think they’re gonna vote Reform, and I don’t think it’s just my dinner circle crowd.  Lucy Fisher (Laughter) That could be, Robert. Robert Shrimsley
That wouldn’t have happened five or six years ago. People are openly talking about how they like Farage and are ready to vote Reform — people you wouldn’t expect to be saying that, so . . .  Lucy Fisher
I must just pick up. There was a rather amusing moment at the conference where Jordan Peterson was in conversation with Nigel Farage. I don’t think he was entirely read up on his private life and said, you know, Nigel, don’t you agree that the most important organisational principle for society is the committed, stable, heterosexual, monogamous, child-centred marriage? And you could see Farage (sound of clearing throat) sort of . . .  Gideon Rachman
Well, he made a joke about it. Lucy Fisher
He swallows, and I may not be the best person to comment on that. Nigel Farage in audio clip
Well, I may not necessarily be the best advocate for monogamous heterosexuality or stable marriage, having been having been divorced twice. Robert Shrimsley
Watching Nigel Farage’s face — I was in the hall for that interview session — and Nigel Farage looking to . . . What have I wandered into? (Laughter) Dan Thomas
He was the most normal person there. That’s extraordinary. Lucy Fisher
There were some pretty controversial people on the line-up as well as kind of very mainstream politicians. And one that struck me was Konstantin Kisin, who was a headliner just a day after a controversy erupted over his suggestion that Rishi Sunak, the British ex-prime minister born and bred in Southampton, could not be considered English because he is, and I quote, a brown Hindu. I mean, Gideon, that’s just quite straightforward ethno-nationalism, no? Gideon Rachman
Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think . . . I didn’t see the full clip. Of course, that didn’t stop me immediately thinking about it. But Kisin’s defence was that he was making this old distinction between British, which is a non-ethnic sort of portfolio term, and English, etc. But I think the trouble . . .  Lucy Fisher
Do you buy that? Gideon Rachman
Not really, no. Well, maybe in his own mind — I don’t know what’s in his mind — but I think the trouble is that if you pair it with the fact that this is a guy who bangs on about the dangers of mass immigration all the time, it stops being a sort of interesting debate about is there a distinction between English and British. And he is saying this prime minister of Britain is not English, who was born and raised in England. Robert Shrimsley
He waited to meet Kemi Badenoch. Gideon Rachman Well, absolutely. Yeah. And so, yeah, I mean, there’s no other way of seeing it other than as a form of ethno-nationalism.  And I think that is kind of threatening to a lot of us, you know, that . . . I was just back from Germany, and I’d been talking to a prominent German diplomat, and he was saying that, you know, in his family when he grew up, because of the Nazi era, people really didn’t want to talk about, like, where were your origins? Where were you born? Because, as he pointed out you couldn’t join the SS unless you proved that you had German-Aryan ancestry going back seven generations.  Now, Kisin is some way from that, but he’s introducing those sorts of things. Well, who’s English, who isn’t? And it really it’s about blood isn’t it? It’s about ethnicity. And that, I think, is it’s not a debate that we’ve had in England and I’m glad we haven’t. Lucy Fisher
It is turning a corner, Robert, from most of the campaigners on the right against mass migration who say the issue here is a failure of multiculturalism or of people who have migrated to the UK to integrate, rather than that they don’t have the right ethnic make-up. Robert Shrimsley Although, I mean, I speak cause my grandparents migrated to this country. So I listen to this and find myself thinking, well, what am I? Am I British? Once upon a time, the argument with immigration was you came to this country, you adopted the values, your children are British. British, English, whatever.  But I mean, I think that what we’re seeing, we see it increasingly, is people in the spectrum of the right to the Conservative party and Reform, you’ll hear them talking about white British, the percentage of white British in London, or the percentage of white Christian in London ’cause actually, Christianity is hanging on, not least because of all the immigrants from Africa in terms of percentage of observant people.  And you find you’re thinking, well, why the focus on white British? You know, are the descendants of the Windrush generation not British in your mind? What are you telling us here? That only people, you know, who can find their names in the Domesday Book have a right to this full respect? Gideon Rachman
Sure. And that reminds me, I for my sins go to England football matches. And I remember talking to a far-right guy who said — we’re talking about an England-Brazil game and England won 2-0 — so we only really won 1-0, because John Barnes scored one of the goals and he’s black. Lucy Fisher
Oh my God. Gideon Rachman
And that’s the route we’re going down. He’s not really English. Yeah. Dan Thomas
It’s not so long ago, is it, really, if you think about it. Robert Shrimsley I mean, there is . . . Just to be slightly fair to Konstantin Kisin, I’ve known him quite a long time. There is an interesting argument, and one I’ve had about myself, which is if England doesn’t exist as a legal legislative entity, there is no parliament for England. Then if your identity, your citizenship is British, until England exists as a legal and legislative identity, then English is an ethnicity.  And I know plenty of people who are immigrants or immigrant descent who consider themselves English, and plenty people who go, no, I’m British. And the only time you really feel, no, I’m English, is perhaps when you go to Scotland. (Laughter) Gideon Rachman
Or indeed, watch the England football team, which is probably one of the few sort of unifying English things. Lucy Fisher
Dan, final word to you on this, obviously you cover all things media around the world, but where do you see this kind of rightwing movement going? Dan Thomas Well, it’s fascinating, isn’t it, because you can see, particularly in the US clearly, because as Robert was saying, you know, Trump is in many ways influencing a great deal of influence over what the US media now covers. And the ones that are fighting back are finding their lives more and more difficult.  So you can see that world is becoming more and more testing, I think, for independent and normalised media. So you can see the shift towards the right over there. It’s difficult to say.  I mean, like, you know, some of those things that were coming out in the conference around DEI policies, for example. People really didn’t like the idea about DEI. Lots of people were saying that there’s a good thing that Trump was taking these, dogeing these, you know, these policies over in the US.  You can see those things are actually becoming now more acceptable to say. And because of that, you’ll find the press as well reflecting these things more and more. So I think, you know, I think the Trump aspects of those are increasingly influential in how the press is covering.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Lucy Fisher
We’ve just got time left for Political Fix stock picks. Robert, who are you buying or selling this week? Robert Shrimsley OK. With some trepidation and no originality whatsoever, I’m actually going to buy Keir Starmer, because I think one of the potential makings of a prime minister is a crisis. When things happen that shocks from outside, which allow you to reset a narrative, which allow you to say I’m on top of this and I look like a prime minister, don’t I, voters? That’s an opportunity.  Now, for the reasons we discussed earlier, there are all kinds of ways it could still go badly wrong for him, but it’s an opportunity for him to stamp himself on the country and say, I’m standing up for what we’re about and I’m right and don’t you agree with me? So even though it could all go wrong, I’m gonna buy Starmer. Lucy Fisher
Gideon? Gideon Rachman
So I’m gonna buy somebody I met for the first time this week. It was a young Lib Dem MP, guy called Mike Martin, who I think won Tunbridge Wells for the first time in a century from when the Tories didn’t hold it. And he’s a smart person and I could see him having a good future in British politics if the Lib Dems have a future. He’s ex-army officer, understands national security, youngish, quite good looking, articulate. And so yeah, I think he could do well. Robert Shrimsley
What about you, Lucy? Lucy Fisher Well, we’ve been discussing the Spectator, so I’m buying its new-ish editor, Michael Gove, the former Tory cabinet minister. As we’ve reported, he’s on Rishi Sunak’s resignation honours list, so he might also be going to the House of Lords soon too.  But I’ve been interested in how he’s using the magazine, and in particular this week has launched a big initiative pointing out frivolous funding by the government. And often, it must be said, during the time in which he was in the cabinet and serving in the UK administration. But he’s very good at seizing the agenda, and I think there is a wider push on the right foot to sort of call for a UK-style Doge unit or movement.  Dan, how about you? Dan Thomas I will, just because we saw him this week, I’ll go with Nigel Farage. I’m sure you’ve had before, but only because I thought he handled the question from Jordan Peterson over his own family incredibly well. Like I said, he came across as very human, very normal on the stage or in a crowd, which sometimes could be the other way. So I think he had a pretty good weekend.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Lucy Fisher
Great. Well, that’s all we’ve got time for. Robert Shrimsley, Dan Thomas and Gideon Rachman, thanks for joining. Gideon Rachman

We’ll meet again here next week.  [MUSIC PLAYING]",2025-02-21,This is an audio transcript of the Political Fix podcast episode,"In the latest episode of the Financial Times' Political Fix podcast, host Lucy Fisher and guests discuss various geopolitical dynamics, particularly focusing on the implications of recent statements and actions by Donald Trump regarding Ukraine and U.S.-European relations. 

Key points covered include:

1. **Keir Starmer's Upcoming Visit**: UK Labour leader Keir Starmer is set to visit the White House, with speculation about his potential role in bridging U.S. and European interests amid shifting political landscapes.

2. **Trump's Shift in U.S. Foreign Policy**: Trump's comments, including calling Ukrainian President Zelenskyy a dictator and asserting that Ukraine instigated the war, suggest a troubling shift where America may be viewed as an adversary rather than an ally by Europe.

3. **Europe's Response**: In reaction to perceived U.S. unreliability, European nations are starting to rethink their defense strategies, with some countries like Denmark raising defense spending and others discussing strategies for dealing with Russia independently.

4. **Cultural and Political Movements**: The podcast also discusses the ""Arc conference,"" which promotes right-wing values and Christian moralism in the UK, drawing connections to current trends in U.S. conservative politics. Speakers at the conference highlighted perceived crises facing Western civilization.

5. **Potential Consequences for UK Defense Spending**: There's a growing expectation that the UK may need to increase defense spending amidst geopolitical tensions, though how this will be financed remains uncertain.

Overall, the discussions emphasize the increasing apprehension in Europe regarding U.S. intentions under Trump's leadership, alongside the rise of right-wing movements that reflect similar sentiments in both the UK and the U.S. The sentiment is that Europe must prepare to defend itself amid concerns about American commitment to NATO and allied security."

Lucy Fisher
Hello, I’m Lucy Fisher and this is Political Fix from the Financial Times. Welcome. Coming up, it’s been a crunch week in parliament for the assisted dying bill. A key safeguard has been changed — the need for a High Court judge to sign off cases. Is it a sensible efficiency or a move that could sink the legislation? Plus, Europe is reeling from the US’s extraordinary intervention on Ukraine. What happens next and what does it mean for Britain and its attitude to defence? To discuss it all, I’m joined by my colleague Stephen Bush. Hi, Stephen.

So let’s kick off talking about assisted dying, obviously one of the most consequential social changes in decades if it goes ahead. But it’s been a really knotty week of fierce and emotional wranglings in parliament. Laura, you’ve been covering this in and out for months. You’ve been on the pod before to talk about it. Just get us up to speed on what’s happened this week.

Laura Hughes
So it’s been a confusing whirlwind of a week because there’s been a massive row effectively over an amendment. The author of the bill has proposed at the very last minute, which massively and quite dramatically does change the shape of what it looks like. So Kim Leadbeater, whose bill this is, very late on Monday was briefing newspapers that she was going to remove in this amendment a requirement for a High Court judge to sign off on any application and instead replace that with a panel of experts which might include a senior legal expert, but would not be a High Court judge.

And for many MPs, this is seen as watering down the bill. And it’s fed into arguments about a slippery slope — you know, the law will change, etc. Why is it already changing so dramatically before it’s even been passed? And it has raised questions about the viability of the bill. It’s also raised serious considerations and questions about just the legislative process, which underlines this whole change. And so it’s been quite a contentious week.

And whilst Kim Leadbeater is arguing that it strengthens her bill, others are saying it doesn’t. Now, questions as to whether or not MPs are gonna change their mind, could the whole shape of this move considerably? Will it pass? Will it not?

Lucy Fisher
Well, we’ll get into all of that. Robert, Laura outlines two kind of key debates here. One is about the substance. So let’s talk about that first. How big a difference is it moving from the initial proposal for two doctors to sign off for requests for a terminally ill person to end their life that would then be signed off by a judge after speaking to one of the medics to what is now being proposed, which is that a person’s application to end their own life would be reviewed by a panel of psychiatrists and social workers, which was chaired by a senior legal figure who would not necessarily be a judge.

Robert Shrimsley
Well, I think there are, unfortunately, two conflicting ways of looking at what’s happened, Lucy. I’ve always thought the measure that the idea that it would have to be signed off by High Court judges was a stupid idea because you could see the courts already busy being bombarded with having to make these decisions. It doesn’t happen anywhere else. And it was one of those extra measures put in to reassure people that it would really, really, really be safe in Britain. But it was never really workable.

And what’s happened is the government, which is actually behind and assisting quite heavily in a number of the amendments, has just made it clear that this isn’t viable. So I actually think the new idea is a better one. But the problem is, having offered that safeguard, it does weaken the bill for some people who are potentially wavering. So even though I think it’s the correct move, I think it’s made their job a lot harder.

Lucy Fisher
And Stephen, it sort of plays into this idea that some MPs who are tentatively supporting the bill and are now wavering have that this legislation is a bit of a dog’s dinner because the initial proposal of a High Court judge being involved in every single application was sold by Kim Leadbeater, as Laura made clear, as a key safeguard. So to change that, even if it is a good idea, as Robert would argue it is, it just sort of casts more doubt on the process of how this legislation is being brought forward.

Stephen Bush
Yeah. Well, one of the reasons why the vote in favour at second reading was so large is there are a lot of MPs who didn’t want to let the issue fade away. They knew it would be seen as a defeat for it in principle. Obviously, that’s what second reading is about. But they have a huge number of doubts about the underlying assumptions of this bill, which is it consciously envisages a quite limited number of use cases for the right to die. And lots of people, I think, correctly think that would not be the end form of the legislation.

But broadly speaking, whenever you make any form of big public policy change, you build on whatever your starting point is. And I think it does underline the anxiety some MPs have. And this is a very poor approach to ensuring the right to die and enshrining into legislation.

I’m not . . . Yeah, Robert’s exactly right. The original sin here was a mechanism which would have meant that the UK would have legalised assisted dying in practice. But broadly speaking, given that you have to have a terminal diagnosis of six months and there are very few people in the United Kingdom who get a court date within six months, it did raise the possibility that we would effectively have a merely theoretical right to die. And it just, yeah, it does just make people go, we shouldn’t be doing this via a private member’s bill, or that’s traditionally been how issues of conscience have been passed. Oh yeah, the government needs to take more control of this legislation, etc. So it does potentially imperil the passage of the bill.

Robert Shrimsley
Can I just push back on one point, because I think there’s a narrative that’s being developed against this bill by its opponents that you’ve got quite a lot of people who are absolutely opposed to the principle of assisted dying. And what they’re doing is attacking the bill on a process argument and saying the procedure isn’t right. We’re not being allowed to do this. We’re not having this amendment called. And they’re trying to make out that this is an absolute chaos and shambles when in fact, almost all major legislation has amendments tabled to it while it’s working its way through. Things change, things develop.

And although there are issues with this bill and I do think what happened this week undoubtedly hurt the cause, the narrative that’s being developed that this is all a shambles and there is . . . It is a sort of cover for people who want to kill the bill anyway and are often using the amendments in the process to water it down and water it down to the point that it becomes meaningless. So one has to at least push back on that notion a little bit, I think.

Lucy Fisher
That’s interesting, Robert, and do you think it’s sort of illegitimate or there’s a bit of foul play going on with people who are raising concerns? Is it fair to say that’s happening on both sides? I mean, some people think this safeguard was put in at the beginning to convince people when it was always clear it wouldn’t work, when analysis suggested it would take up 34,000 hours of judicial time and snarl up a process that’s already facing lots of backlogs in the family courts.

Robert Shrimsley
Yeah, I mean, I think on the judge point, I think what you’re seeing actually is the covert involvement of the government quite heavily. We know that Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary — she’s not a supporter of this bill, by the way — has pushed very hard to get this judge measure changed.

And so I think what you’re seeing is behind the scenes I was talking to one of the major figures involved in this bill earlier this week and they were saying, you know, they’re getting a lot of civil service backing, a lot of government help tabling amendments. And I think what you’re seeing is quietly the government trying to knock the worst bits of this bill out.

And of course, you also have people who I think Stephen was alluding to who think the bill doesn’t go far enough and would like to see it extended for people with degenerative diseases, for example. But I think those people are sort of acting within the spirit of the bill and the spirit of the second reading vote.

What I think you’ve got on the other side are people who are absolutely opposed to this, who don’t want to see it go through and believe that if they can weaken it, push back on the safeguards, actually make out this argument, it’s not being done properly, they can kill the whole measure. And so I don’t think it’s an entirely good-faith exercise by those who are claiming to be doing this simply to make it more rigorous.

Lucy Fisher
Laura, you’ve been speaking to lots of experts and you had a brilliant interview earlier this week with Baroness Brenda Hale, the former president of the UK Supreme Court, she of the spider brooch during the Brexit years. She had a view that judges should be involved. Perhaps they could be at a level below High Court judge, perhaps circuit or district judges.

I just wanted to ask about this broader issue of the expert views that have been taken, because another sort of source of claim and counterclaim is that at this crucial committee stage we’ve been seeing in parliament is that Kim Leadbeater has been taking more evidence from voices essentially in support of her bill rather than from experts. For example, people giving testimony on coercive control that might speak to arguments against it. You’ve been following it closely. What’s your take on the weighting of the expert evidence they’ve been looking at?

Laura Hughes
Yeah, I mean, that argument has been made. If you were looking at it, though, I guess from the perspective of trying to be proactive in pushing it through and making it the strongest legislation you can, you can understand why she’s called some of the experts she has. And Chris Whitty, he was a really balanced, I thought, witness at that committee stage.

Lucy Fisher
The chief medical officer.

Laura Hughes
Yeah. And I mean, I think another criticism, though, that is maybe even more valid is the kind of the weighting of the MPs on the committee, the majority of whom did actually vote in favour of the bill. So that is one argument. It’s so heated though that you can argue it both ways.

I think there have been a range of views given at that committee. I don’t think it would be fair to say that they all spoke in favour and all sat there and said, yes, this is a tremendous idea. Push on. I think it has been constructive conversations and it’s raised really interesting questions on where, for example, in the NHS would this service sit? Would it be something offered inside the NHS? Would it be outside? Could we see a system that we saw when abortion changes were made and charities effectively set up clinics that were funded by the NHS? So it has got into really good areas of policy and how it would work. So I think that is a little bit unfair. But of course there are questions about how that whole thing is happening.

And back to the point on the judge change, I think there’s a question as to whether or not it was wise for Kim Leadbeater herself to table this amendment. Why did it come from her, because it has slightly fed into critics’ arguments of slippery slope, things changing.

Lucy Fisher
Can I ask you, I think Robert sort of hinted at this, but there is this suggestion that this is the government pulling the strings. They wanted this change, but it’s been presented by her and that’s created a sense of intrigue. Has this come from her? Has this come from ministers, officials? What’s your take on this?

Laura Hughes
I mean, she . . . Her team is sort of she would really insist that she’s not having her strings pulled by the government. And she’s stuck in a really unfortunate position, I think. She’s obviously under a lot of heat and actually she’s been the one to stand up and take this on. She knows this is obviously in favour of it. I’m sure there are conversations that clearly are happening and have happened.

And I do want to speak a little bit in her defence. Whatever your views are, this is an impossible position she’s almost been put in and it was quite brave of her to take this on. And she’s listening clearly to what people are telling her. And these assessments have been done by various government departments — health, justice — after the bill was passed. And she’s taking on that feedback. And in her mind, she’s trying to strengthen it and she’s trying to do things she thinks are in the best interests of getting this bill passed. You can also see why critics can just jump on it and say she’s being told what to do and she hasn’t got a grip on it. She’s not experienced enough to take on such a huge topic so early on in her parliamentary career.

Lucy Fisher
Robert, another area there are still questions is about the cost of this. It’s past the sort of the finance stage, which, again, some critics are saying they’re worried it’s a blank cheque. Do you think there needs to be more detail set out about how it would be funded?

Robert Shrimsley
Well, it can never do any harm for you to know how things are going to be funded. Again, I think this comes back to the point of people trying to pick at this bill in lots of different ways. But there are lots and lots of questions.

I mean, I have to say, I think the whole process has been strange. I was very impressed and I spent quite a bit of time studying what happened in Jersey where they had a couple of citizens’ juries on this. And what they did, they had a process where essentially they first of all took the decision in principle and then they went into the how are we going to make this work? What are the practices of this?

And interestingly, once they went into the safeguards and practices, support for it increased because people began to feel satisfied that their arguments were being listened to. You don’t get the sense that is happening here. I mean, I don’t think it’s surprising, by the way, that the committee has a bias towards supporters. I mean, generally, legislative committees do have, you know, a majority of people on them who will support the measure.

But I think what isn’t happening is that this measure is not yet winning a broader level of support, which you would hoped it would do once the vote in principle had been taken. And I think that’s the fault of both sides. I think the way this has been structured has not been ideal and the way people have gone after it has made it less inclusive and raises the question whether at some point the government ought to simply take it over, although that carries all kinds of other problems, too.

Lucy Fisher
I’m interested in all your views on whether you think it’s actually gonna pass now. So it was a majority of 55 MPs at that second reading, so 28 MPs would need to change their mind from yes to no to scupper the bill. That feels quite a lot to me on the one hand. And yet, you know, there is a lot of grumbling across the media of people who said they supported it and they’re now wavering. I don’t know. What do you think, Stephen? Is sentiment or not-sentiment cooling or not?

Stephen Bush
I think it’s too early to tell, not least because the . . . Like, the other arm of this is the House of Lords, which will be able to take as long as it over it wants and where there’s a lot more legal expertise. So it could end up yet looking different again. But yeah, look, I think as it stands, I think it would pass by a reduced majority, but it is very much in flux.

I think Robert is exactly right, that one problem with the the way we’ve approached this, there is far too much ambiguity among the members of the MP or committee stage about whether or not what they actually want to do by calling certain witnesses is address a genuine concern or if they want to use the genuine concern as a way of eroding support for the bill.

And, you know, both are politically legitimate things to want to do, but they are obviously incompatible, right? That if what you want to do is just sit around and go, oh, coercive control is a problem, well fine, that is a great argument to vote against it at second reading and at third reading. But it’s not actually a helpful thing to say at committee stage and it is therefore quite difficult to work out what will happen with this legislation because I think in the House of Lords where you will get a better quality of scrutiny from people who have concern about some of the legislative kinks in this process, that might mean that it comes back to MP and people go, oh, you can’t solve the coercive control problem. Therefore I will vote against. But I think the committee stage process on the House of Commons side is probably not going to clarify one way or the other whether or not the ultimate form of this legislation will pass.

Laura Hughes
No. And this feels like a really messy week and everyone’s very emotional and people are speaking out. They’re speaking to different newspapers and everyone’s trying to get numbers. But I just . . . My gut feeling is that until you actually know what you’re voting on and you can sit down and you’ve had a bit more time, it is really hard to say I think it still might . . . I still think it might go through. This is just a really difficult week and it’s not been played very well politically, I don’t think, from the change in the law side at all. And they should learn the lessons from this week if they want to get it through. I still think it . . . I still think it might.

Lucy Fisher
Robert?

Robert Shrimsley
Well, I mean, like Stephen, I’m just not sure at this stage. I don’t think the majority was large enough to be totally confident that support won’t slip away. The only thing I would say is that the principle of assisted dying is very heavily supported in the country. And so although there are some very strong and strident voices against this in some newsrooms and some news organisations are coming out against this, there is a strong will for this in the general public. So, I mean, I still think on balance it will probably sneak through. But there are some rocky, rocky days ahead. And as I said, an element of me thinks at some point the government is gonna have to step in a little bit more aggressively than it has, even though it will have to remain a free vote right through.

Lucy Fisher
And then, Robert, in the Lords, you know, I think we’re gonna hear a lot more faith-based arguments. Some have been put forward in the Commons. Is that a sort of a valid part of this debate? I’m just thinking back to when this all kicked off in the autumn. Lord Faulkner, former Lord Chancellor, who is very much kind of working with Kim Leadbeater on this bill, sort of stepped in when Shabana Mahmood, the first female Muslim in the cabinet, said she was sort of against it on faith-based grounds to say that actually, it was secular views that were more objective than spiritual objections. What do you think about that?

Robert Shrimsley
It’s a difficult one, isn’t it, because on the one hand, you know, why should your faith affect my death? I don’t see why your religious views should govern my decision-making if I don’t share them. On the other hand, the one thing I will say is that I do think that when people openly oppose this on faith-based grounds, I have a lot more sympathy for them than when people who are fundamentally against this on faith-based grounds come up with other reasons to oppose it using issues like safeguarding or a sudden interest in hospice care or process. But at least people making the faith argument openly are being honest in their position.

It’s not a view I agree with because I think people should be free to make their own decisions. And I’ve always thought it’s wrong that the only person with no say over how you die is the person doing the dying. But at least it’s open.

Stephen Bush
I think also the thing which is really useful about the spiritual argument against it is it is important for all of us to reflect on the fact that if this legislation passes, that is a fundamental change, particularly given our particular model, our particular solution to the question of how do you get free-at-the-point-of-use healthcare, right? That is a major change in the type of state and the type of society that we are.

So whether we’re godless atheists like myself or not, it is worth reflecting on the very useful challenge that the religious case against doing this does pose. And I think Robert’s exactly right. That’s actually much more helpful when it comes explicitly than like one of the reasons why this process hasn’t been good is that we’ve done, I think, collectively the political class has done a very poor job of discussing this legislation as well as it did in 2015, actually, I think.

The other missing part, that sort of the dog hasn’t barked yet, is that we have a government that is basically going we don’t have a solution to this problem of social care yet, but the fix you do for social care does influence the level of protection from coercion, the incentives people will have to end their lives sooner because at the moment, we essentially do have a situation where if you get an illness, there’s a kind of genetic lottery of whether or not that will destroy and erode all of your family savings. And so I do think at some point, hopefully, we’ll realise we do have to discuss both sort of arm in arm the right to die and whatever the solution to the social care crisis is.

Lucy Fisher
Because that’s one element is come into debate or at least come to the forefront this week, Laura, isn’t it, that someone could have a financial incentive that would be permissible in the choice they made about their death? If they had a terminal illness and six months to live, they might choose to die sooner to protect the savings that they left to their family. And there’s nothing in this legislation that would stop that. I think that’s a sort of argument that’s really fascinated a lot of people.

Laura Hughes
It is, actually. And I think, though, as a society, we have to decide whether or not that is acceptable, actually. Is it OK legally for you to say that’s your reason — you want to protect your finances and pass it on to your family? Is that coercion or is that someone looking to look after their loved ones? Is it a good or a bad thing? That’s actually quite a difficult, I think, argument for the state to come down and say is right or wrong.

Stephen Bush
Not these things. The slight weirdness of that debate, and I’m aware I’m a hypocrite as the one who brought it up, right, is that the state says, if you put your family inheritance in a trust or a partnership, you can protect your inheritance in that way. But if at the end of my life I go, well, actually, I would quite like to be able to like leave my flat to my nephew, that’s apparently illegitimate. But if I put the flat in a trust, it would have been fine, you know. I mean, like, so we do already accept and indeed, it’s actually the most cherished thing.

It’s why inheritance tax is such a politically toxic thing to change. We do accept that most people prioritise leaving something for their children and their loved ones when they die. And so I think it is one of the most thorny parts of this debate, but it is actually a really important part to nail and get right because understandably, people do want their end-of-life decisions not to leave their families out of pocket.

Laura Hughes
And it’s something I think real families actually talk about and sometimes just sort of joke about. Don’t stick me in that care home and spend that much money. You know, we really do talk about it. And I think this bill and this whole conversation, these are the real human decisions that we’re all gonna have to make and that we are already talking about now. What is this law gonna mean for it?

And just on the religious point, I think, you know, it’s obviously a very calculated decision from some campaign groups not to talk about religion because they see society being one that doesn’t respond to those arguments in the way they might have done a hundred years ago. And that is why they’re doing it, but I agree, it’s also . . . It’s sometimes refreshing, actually, when you do have a religious figure coming out and saying it. And it’s hard to argue and counter against it. And it has been missing, I think, a little bit. People are scared about talking about it from that perspective, but it’s obviously a very valid one and you have your right to have it.

Lucy Fisher
And we should point out that there are secular organisations like Liberty, a human rights organisation, that, you know, is not supporting this legislation which is on purely secular grounds.

Robert, there have been 350 amendments tabled to this legislation. Are there any others in particular that have caught your eye that you think, you know, would be really good to improve it or should definitely be discarded?

Robert Shrimsley
Yes. I mean, I think the one that interested me is the amendment to try and extend the scope of this to cover people who have terrible degenerative illnesses like motor neurone disease, who I think currently are outside the scope of the measure or probably outside it.

Clearly, doctors can decide what is and isn’t a terminal diagnosis and those people are left outside to face a potentially very awful and painful death. But I think the issue here is that you’re trying to have a social, what I consider to be a social advance.

And you can’t let the best be the enemy of the good. And saying, no, look, we’re not going to include people with mental conditions, with mental health issues. We’re not going to have degenerative illnesses. You’ve got to be dying and dying quite soon before this is available to you is, I think, a way of providing some of the reassurances that people talk about when they say they don’t want coercive control, they don’t want people pushed into dying.

If you actually are able to say, look, this person probably only has six months to live. Maybe they’ll hang on for another four or four and a half and give up when the pain is too great. I think that gives you a degree of narrowness of the bill which says we are keeping this carefully controlled.

Lucy Fisher
Stephen? Laura?

Stephen Bush
Well, yeah, I mean, I realise that also to me is the standout amendment, although I have the reverse perspective on it, which is that I completely get the argument that, you know, you don’t wanna scare the horses. And it’s this you’re asking people to take this quite big leap in terms of, you know, the type of country we are, etc.

But I think for so many people around the country, including people who follow politics closely, the thing they think will change with assisted dying is if you get a degenerative illness with an uncertain prognosis, you won’t die in incredible and avoidable agony.

I think if you want to have a procedure for the right to end your life that is safe, secure, all of the rest of it, you have to start, I think, from what most people’s idea of what that right would involve, which does include degenerative illnesses. It rightly, in my view, doesn’t include depression and other things like that. But I think the kind of the original sin, as it were, of this legislation is it’s focused a little bit, it’s focused far too much on reassuring people.

And that is why it’s ended up with this slight hodgepodge of not meeting the right that most people imagine and would like when they hear about this legislation and having a safeguard that either would be too hard to safeguard because in practice you wouldn’t get a court date or is inadequate for people who have degenerative illnesses.

Laura Hughes
Interesting, I asked Baroness Hale whether there are any other amendments that she was interested in that might change the shape of the bill and she spoke in favour and said it’d be a significant improvement to look at extending it to 12 months for applicants that do have these neurological conditions who might not have the mental capacity to make such a decision six months within the end of their life.

And I thought that was interesting. It just sort of felt if you’re going to do this, do it properly because you then avoid these arguments later down in the slippery slope. If you’re gonna expand it, do it. Now is the moment to move into it and make your argument and make it sensibly and well. But interesting, Kim Leadbeater doesn’t support extending it to 12 months. I’m not sure that one will get through.

Lucy Fisher
Laura Hughes, public policy correspondent, thanks for joining.

Laura Hughes
Thank you, Lucy.

Lucy Fisher
We’ve also seen monumental movements on Ukraine this week. Donald Trump on Wednesday said that after talking to Russian President Vladimir Putin that their delegations would start negotiations immediately to end the war, blindsiding European capitals. Robert, what’s your reaction to this sort of seismic move of the past few days on Ukraine?

Robert Shrimsley
It’s quite a tricky one. I have to say actually my first instinct and my struggle was that there was a lot to be worried about here, that the steps that Donald Trump has taken is just gonna be me and Vladimir Putin sorting it all out, you know. We’re gonna come up with it. We’re gonna get Europe to pay and Europe to police it but they’re not gonna be in the room.

And Trump already saying he’s ruled out Nato membership and he’s ruled out any return to 2014 boundaries, even though I think both of those were where we were gonna end up. It felt like he’d given a lot away to Vladimir Putin from the outset and also added to comments made by Pete Hegseth, his defence secretary, about America not being the primary guarantor of defence of the security of Europe. This all seemed, and still, I think, seems very, very worrying.

However, I will just say I did read a little earlier a piece by Lawrence Friedman, which I think the FT is publishing today. And his argument was that actually, Trump has put Putin in a bit of a spot because he’s got to figure out what concessions he’s now prepared to make. And Trump has left him in this position where he’s got to make the next move. And none of these moves are necessarily as helpful to him as you think. So maybe my first reaction was overly worried.

Lucy Fisher
That is interesting. I mean, Stephen, Robert is probably right that we just get to the end point faster, but Trump has kind of given up the negotiating position, hasn’t he, by making the concessions about the border and Nato membership?

Stephen Bush
Yeah. And also, as importantly, he’s underlined that he has no particular interest in the concerns or interests of the democracies of Europe, right? And then ultimately, it’s not just the content of what he said. Those were not conversations in which, you know, he talked to Ukraine first or talked to the EU27 or talked to the United Kingdom first, which underlines the existential challenge that it poses for all of us here in Europe and for governments to respond to that.

Lucy Fisher
Well, it’s a good moment to sort of bring in what this means for the UK. Our Political Fix regular and colleague George Parker and I worked on a piece this week looking at the gap between what the Treasury wants to spend on defence, which is basically sticking to 2.3 per cent of GDP, what Labour has promised in its manifesto, which is 2.5 per cent of GDP, and what the military chiefs of the British forces are wanting to get to, which is 2.65 per cent. The difference with the Treasury and the military chiefs is worth about 10bn a year, so it is quite significant.

Robert, is this sort of pointless wrangling between different parts of the UK administration on this issue if there’s gonna need to be a Europe wide move to sort of boost defence spending and be more self-reliant and less reliant on the US?

Robert Shrimsley
I think to a degree, yeah, but I think the fact is Britain, like a number of European countries, is going to have to spend more. And although, you know, one would expect the military to be making arguments that maximise the pressure on the government to give more money to their services, they are right. And I think the pressure to find the money somehow is going to be very, very acute.

I have to say, not being a defence specialist myself, I always wonder about the argument that says the views defence spending as a percentage of GDP rather than saying, what do we need to spend it on? How can we spend it well? Are we spending it in the right way? But I suppose as a sort of lever to increase spending generally, it is the right thing. I don’t think there’s any room around this one, and I think the Treasury is gonna have to find a way to come up with the funding. And it’s not a simple matter.

Lucy Fisher
And Stephen, you’ve been writing about this this week, how the government squares its economic imperative, funnelling more money into infrastructure and housing, plus its strategic imperative, more money for defence, with Rachel Reeves’ fiscal rules.

Stephen Bush
Yeah, and I think the problem is, parking for a moment the question about whether or not the government’s fiscal rule is the most well designed rule — spoiler alert, it’s not — you can’t really meet the aim of more spending for infrastructure, which obviously an economic imperative. The electoral imperative of make the public services a bit better and the security imperative of be able to defend ourselves and take action in our own theatre without private consumption taking a bit of a hit, right? So it’s very hard to see how she can do all of that without either breaking one of those imperatives or breaking that manifesto commitment on tax. It is very difficult.

I mean, I agree with Robert on percentage targets. I’m always reminded of the story about how the EU’s 3 per cent rule arose, which was when France’s then finance minister was like, well, we’re already at 1.5 so 2, that’s a bit too close. 2.5, that seems weirdly precise, so I guess it’s 3. And very much that the Nato target was, you know, the nations of Europe getting together after the premier and going, what should we do? Well, that number is something some of us already hit. That number’s a round figure. Oh, we’re gonna pick this one.

But for the United Kingdom in particular, whereas you know, you know much better than me, right? We’ve had a series of procurement failures. We have an MoD which many people think needs serious reform if it’s going to meet the same, and we do not have an armed forces that is capable of acting independently or doing power protection or any of the things that you would want it to do. In some ways, the percentage target is kind of a bit moot. Clearly, the number needs to go up quite a lot. Clearly, the MoD needs quite serious reforms and clearly none of that is compatible with the promises that the Labour party made at the last election.

Lucy Fisher
Well, it’s gonna be a big weekend as the Munich Security Conference takes place with David Lammy, John Healey and all sorts of other defence and foreign ministers from across Nato, including of course the US, jetting into Munich. And perhaps the slightly grim irony that this discussion about Ukraine will play out in a city forever associated with fairly catastrophic appeasement of Hitler.

We’ve just got time left for stock picks. Robert, who are you buying or selling this week?

Robert Shrimsley
OK. So I think the person I’m going to light upon is Liz Kendall, the welfare and pension secretary, because we’re not too far away now from what is promised to be the major plan on welfare reform, particularly on cutting the numbers of people on sickness benefit and cutting the sickness benefit bill, which is enormous.

And I’ve been trying to debate whether I wanted to buy her or sell her on the basis of this, because there’s no question that going into this process is gonna upset an awful lot of people in her own party that if she does it properly, there are gonna be Labour MPs howling about withdrawal of benefits or making it much harder to keep benefits.

But I think in the end, I’m gonna buy her just because I think of my inherently optimistic and sunny nature that I just think this is such an important reform. It’s reform that’s got to work, not least for the reasons that Stephen was just outlining about the financial situation the government is in. I think welfare reform needs to really happen. And she is quite a tough reformer, so I’m gonna give her the benefit of doubt and buy her.

Lucy Fisher
Stephen, how about you?

Stephen Bush
I’m gonna cheat and I’m both going to sell Rachel Reeves, who obviously on the 27th of March is going to, you know, thanks to this combination of the OBR’s growth figures, these pressures on defence spending, etc, is going to stand up and do something highly unpopular, right? Whether it’s unpopular with the country, the markets, the Labour party or all three, if she’s really unlucky, it’s not gonna be a good couple of months to be a Treasury minister of any stripe and particularly not to be the chancellor.

So that one, but I felt also I should sell Kemi Badenoch because I thought we should probably mention her particularly poor PMQs this week.

Lucy Fisher
You’ve stolen mine. I was going to do that.

Stephen Bush
Sorry.

Lucy Fisher
No, no, go ahead. You say why you’re selling her and I’ll say why I’m selling her.

Stephen Bush
You know, I just think, you know, the donors are unhappy, the MPs are . . . Now, she’s got a real problem in the chamber in that there are very few Conservative MPs.

But, you know, she has that wall of silence behind her, which is never a good sign. The donors are unhappy because they don’t feel loved. And they also . . . They watch and they go like, well, if she’s not across this, what’s the point? You’ve got a resurgent party on the right.

And I just think . . . The thing I’ve been really struck by is the lack of an upward gradient. And so I just think she doesn’t seem to be turning it around, as, you know, you’ve written a very good piece about like, a hundred days, people think that you have until the devolved elections next year, which feels about right to me. But I just don’t think this is a set-up which is going to turn it around. And so I think the focus will be for most of the next year, well, if not her, who?

Lucy Fisher
|I totally agree. And for me too, it was PMQs more than reaching the 100-day mark on Monday and some of the grumbles that came out of the woodwork there that did it for me because she kept asking the same question without reacting to the fact that Keir Starmer had responded. And then he said, you know, you need to deviate from the script, this is getting tedious. But yeah, I thought that was a weakness that just left me shaking my head.

Well, that’s all we’ve got time for this week. Thanks for joining.

Robert Shrimsley
Thanks, Lucy.

Stephen Bush

Hello, I’m Lucy Fisher and this is Political Fix from the Financial Times. Welcome. Coming up, it’s been a crunch week in parliament for the assisted dying bill. A key safeguard has been changed — the need for a High Court judge to sign off cases. Is it a sensible efficiency or a move that could sink the legislation? Plus, Europe is reeling from the US’s extraordinary intervention on Ukraine. What happens next and what does it mean for Britain and its attitude to defence? To discuss it all, I’m joined by my colleague Stephen Bush. Hi, Stephen. Stephen Bush
Hi, Lucy. Lucy Fisher
Robert Shrimsley. Hi, Robert. Robert Shrimsley
Hello, Lucy. Lucy Fisher
And Laura Hughes. Hi, Laura. Laura Hughes Hello.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Lucy Fisher
So let’s kick off talking about assisted dying, obviously one of the most consequential social changes in decades if it goes ahead. But it’s been a really knotty week of fierce and emotional wranglings in parliament. Laura, you’ve been covering this in and out for months. You’ve been on the pod before to talk about it. Just get us up to speed on what’s happened this week. Laura Hughes
So it’s been a confusing whirlwind of a week because there’s been a massive row effectively over an amendment. The author of the bill has proposed at the very last minute, which massively and quite dramatically does change the shape of what it looks like. So Kim Leadbeater, whose bill this is, very late on Monday was briefing newspapers that she was going to remove in this amendment a requirement for a High Court judge to sign off on any application and instead replace that with a panel of experts which might include a senior legal expert, but would not be a High Court judge. And for many MPs, this is seen as watering down the bill. And it’s fed into arguments about a slippery slope — you know, the law will change, etc. Why is it already changing so dramatically before it’s even been passed? And it has raised questions about the viability of the bill. It’s also raised serious considerations and questions about just the legislative process, which underlines this whole change. And so it’s been quite a contentious week. And whilst Kim Leadbeater is arguing that it strengthens her bill, others are saying it doesn’t. Now, questions as to whether or not MPs are gonna change their mind, could the whole shape of this move considerably? Will it pass? Will it not? Lucy Fisher
Well, we’ll get into all of that. Robert, Laura outlines two kind of key debates here. One is about the substance. So let’s talk about that first. How big a difference is it moving from the initial proposal for two doctors to sign off for requests for a terminally ill person to end their life that would then be signed off by a judge after speaking to one of the medics to what is now being proposed, which is that a person’s application to end their own life would be reviewed by a panel of psychiatrists and social workers, which was chaired by a senior legal figure who would not necessarily be a judge. Robert Shrimsley
Well, I think there are, unfortunately, two conflicting ways of looking at what’s happened, Lucy. I’ve always thought the measure that the idea that it would have to be signed off by High Court judges was a stupid idea because you could see the courts already busy being bombarded with having to make these decisions. It doesn’t happen anywhere else. And it was one of those extra measures put in to reassure people that it would really, really, really be safe in Britain. But it was never really workable. And what’s happened is the government, which is actually behind and assisting quite heavily in a number of the amendments, has just made it clear that this isn’t viable. So I actually think the new idea is a better one. But the problem is, having offered that safeguard, it does weaken the bill for some people who are potentially wavering. So even though I think it’s the correct move, I think it’s made their job a lot harder. Lucy Fisher
And Stephen, it sort of plays into this idea that some MPs who are tentatively supporting the bill and are now wavering have that this legislation is a bit of a dog’s dinner because the initial proposal of a High Court judge being involved in every single application was sold by Kim Leadbeater, as Laura made clear, as a key safeguard. So to change that, even if it is a good idea, as Robert would argue it is, it just sort of casts more doubt on the process of how this legislation is being brought forward. Stephen Bush
Yeah. Well, one of the reasons why the vote in favour at second reading was so large is there are a lot of MPs who didn’t want to let the issue fade away. They knew it would be seen as a defeat for it in principle. Obviously, that’s what second reading is about. But they have a huge number of doubts about the underlying assumptions of this bill, which is it consciously envisages a quite limited number of use cases for the right to die. And lots of people, I think, correctly think that would not be the end form of the legislation. But broadly speaking, whenever you make any form of big public policy change, you build on whatever your starting point is. And I think it does underline the anxiety some MPs have. And this is a very poor approach to ensuring the right to die and enshrining into legislation. I’m not . . . Yeah, Robert’s exactly right. The original sin here was a mechanism which would have meant that the UK would have legalised assisted dying in practice. But broadly speaking, given that you have to have a terminal diagnosis of six months and there are very few people in the United Kingdom who get a court date within six months, it did raise the possibility that we would effectively have a merely theoretical right to die. And it just, yeah, it does just make people go, we shouldn’t be doing this via a private member’s bill, or that’s traditionally been how issues of conscience have been passed. Oh yeah, the government needs to take more control of this legislation, etc. So it does potentially imperil the passage of the bill. Robert Shrimsley
Can I just push back on one point, because I think there’s a narrative that’s being developed against this bill by its opponents that you’ve got quite a lot of people who are absolutely opposed to the principle of assisted dying. And what they’re doing is attacking the bill on a process argument and saying the procedure isn’t right. We’re not being allowed to do this. We’re not having this amendment called. And they’re trying to make out that this is an absolute chaos and shambles when in fact, almost all major legislation has amendments tabled to it while it’s working its way through. Things change, things develop. And although there are issues with this bill and I do think what happened this week undoubtedly hurt the cause, the narrative that’s being developed that this is all a shambles and there is . . . It is a sort of cover for people who want to kill the bill anyway and are often using the amendments in the process to water it down and water it down to the point that it becomes meaningless. So one has to at least push back on that notion a little bit, I think. Lucy Fisher
That’s interesting, Robert, and do you think it’s sort of illegitimate or there’s a bit of foul play going on with people who are raising concerns? Is it fair to say that’s happening on both sides? I mean, some people think this safeguard was put in at the beginning to convince people when it was always clear it wouldn’t work, when analysis suggested it would take up 34,000 hours of judicial time and snarl up a process that’s already facing lots of backlogs in the family courts. Robert Shrimsley
Yeah, I mean, I think on the judge point, I think what you’re seeing actually is the covert involvement of the government quite heavily. We know that Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary — she’s not a supporter of this bill, by the way — has pushed very hard to get this judge measure changed. And so I think what you’re seeing is behind the scenes I was talking to one of the major figures involved in this bill earlier this week and they were saying, you know, they’re getting a lot of civil service backing, a lot of government help tabling amendments. And I think what you’re seeing is quietly the government trying to knock the worst bits of this bill out. And of course, you also have people who I think Stephen was alluding to who think the bill doesn’t go far enough and would like to see it extended for people with degenerative diseases, for example. But I think those people are sort of acting within the spirit of the bill and the spirit of the second reading vote. What I think you’ve got on the other side are people who are absolutely opposed to this, who don’t want to see it go through and believe that if they can weaken it, push back on the safeguards, actually make out this argument, it’s not being done properly, they can kill the whole measure. And so I don’t think it’s an entirely good-faith exercise by those who are claiming to be doing this simply to make it more rigorous. Lucy Fisher
Laura, you’ve been speaking to lots of experts and you had a brilliant interview earlier this week with Baroness Brenda Hale, the former president of the UK Supreme Court, she of the spider brooch during the Brexit years. She had a view that judges should be involved. Perhaps they could be at a level below High Court judge, perhaps circuit or district judges. I just wanted to ask about this broader issue of the expert views that have been taken, because another sort of source of claim and counterclaim is that at this crucial committee stage we’ve been seeing in parliament is that Kim Leadbeater has been taking more evidence from voices essentially in support of her bill rather than from experts. For example, people giving testimony on coercive control that might speak to arguments against it. You’ve been following it closely. What’s your take on the weighting of the expert evidence they’ve been looking at? Laura Hughes
Yeah, I mean, that argument has been made. If you were looking at it, though, I guess from the perspective of trying to be proactive in pushing it through and making it the strongest legislation you can, you can understand why she’s called some of the experts she has. And Chris Whitty, he was a really balanced, I thought, witness at that committee stage. Lucy Fisher
The chief medical officer. Laura Hughes
Yeah. And I mean, I think another criticism, though, that is maybe even more valid is the kind of the weighting of the MPs on the committee, the majority of whom did actually vote in favour of the bill. So that is one argument. It’s so heated though that you can argue it both ways. I think there have been a range of views given at that committee. I don’t think it would be fair to say that they all spoke in favour and all sat there and said, yes, this is a tremendous idea. Push on. I think it has been constructive conversations and it’s raised really interesting questions on where, for example, in the NHS would this service sit? Would it be something offered inside the NHS? Would it be outside? Could we see a system that we saw when abortion changes were made and charities effectively set up clinics that were funded by the NHS? So it has got into really good areas of policy and how it would work. So I think that is a little bit unfair. But of course there are questions about how that whole thing is happening. And back to the point on the judge change, I think there’s a question as to whether or not it was wise for Kim Leadbeater herself to table this amendment. Why did it come from her, because it has slightly fed into critics’ arguments of slippery slope, things changing. Lucy Fisher
Can I ask you, I think Robert sort of hinted at this, but there is this suggestion that this is the government pulling the strings. They wanted this change, but it’s been presented by her and that’s created a sense of intrigue. Has this come from her? Has this come from ministers, officials? What’s your take on this? Laura Hughes
I mean, she . . . Her team is sort of she would really insist that she’s not having her strings pulled by the government. And she’s stuck in a really unfortunate position, I think. She’s obviously under a lot of heat and actually she’s been the one to stand up and take this on. She knows this is obviously in favour of it. I’m sure there are conversations that clearly are happening and have happened. And I do want to speak a little bit in her defence. Whatever your views are, this is an impossible position she’s almost been put in and it was quite brave of her to take this on. And she’s listening clearly to what people are telling her. And these assessments have been done by various government departments — health, justice — after the bill was passed. And she’s taking on that feedback. And in her mind, she’s trying to strengthen it and she’s trying to do things she thinks are in the best interests of getting this bill passed. You can also see why critics can just jump on it and say she’s being told what to do and she hasn’t got a grip on it. She’s not experienced enough to take on such a huge topic so early on in her parliamentary career. Lucy Fisher
Robert, another area there are still questions is about the cost of this. It’s past the sort of the finance stage, which, again, some critics are saying they’re worried it’s a blank cheque. Do you think there needs to be more detail set out about how it would be funded? Robert Shrimsley
Well, it can never do any harm for you to know how things are going to be funded. Again, I think this comes back to the point of people trying to pick at this bill in lots of different ways. But there are lots and lots of questions. I mean, I have to say, I think the whole process has been strange. I was very impressed and I spent quite a bit of time studying what happened in Jersey where they had a couple of citizens’ juries on this. And what they did, they had a process where essentially they first of all took the decision in principle and then they went into the how are we going to make this work? What are the practices of this? And interestingly, once they went into the safeguards and practices, support for it increased because people began to feel satisfied that their arguments were being listened to. You don’t get the sense that is happening here. I mean, I don’t think it’s surprising, by the way, that the committee has a bias towards supporters. I mean, generally, legislative committees do have, you know, a majority of people on them who will support the measure. But I think what isn’t happening is that this measure is not yet winning a broader level of support, which you would hoped it would do once the vote in principle had been taken. And I think that’s the fault of both sides. I think the way this has been structured has not been ideal and the way people have gone after it has made it less inclusive and raises the question whether at some point the government ought to simply take it over, although that carries all kinds of other problems, too. Lucy Fisher
I’m interested in all your views on whether you think it’s actually gonna pass now. So it was a majority of 55 MPs at that second reading, so 28 MPs would need to change their mind from yes to no to scupper the bill. That feels quite a lot to me on the one hand. And yet, you know, there is a lot of grumbling across the media of people who said they supported it and they’re now wavering. I don’t know. What do you think, Stephen? Is sentiment or not-sentiment cooling or not? Stephen Bush
I think it’s too early to tell, not least because the . . . Like, the other arm of this is the House of Lords, which will be able to take as long as it over it wants and where there’s a lot more legal expertise. So it could end up yet looking different again. But yeah, look, I think as it stands, I think it would pass by a reduced majority, but it is very much in flux. I think Robert is exactly right, that one problem with the the way we’ve approached this, there is far too much ambiguity among the members of the MP or committee stage about whether or not what they actually want to do by calling certain witnesses is address a genuine concern or if they want to use the genuine concern as a way of eroding support for the bill.  And, you know, both are politically legitimate things to want to do, but they are obviously incompatible, right? That if what you want to do is just sit around and go, oh, coercive control is a problem, well fine, that is a great argument to vote against it at second reading and at third reading. But it’s not actually a helpful thing to say at committee stage and it is therefore quite difficult to work out what will happen with this legislation because I think in the House of Lords where you will get a better quality of scrutiny from people who have concern about some of the legislative kinks in this process, that might mean that it comes back to MP and people go, oh, you can’t solve the coercive control problem. Therefore I will vote against. But I think the committee stage process on the House of Commons side is probably not going to clarify one way or the other whether or not the ultimate form of this legislation will pass. Laura Hughes
No. And this feels like a really messy week and everyone’s very emotional and people are speaking out. They’re speaking to different newspapers and everyone’s trying to get numbers. But I just . . . My gut feeling is that until you actually know what you’re voting on and you can sit down and you’ve had a bit more time, it is really hard to say I think it still might . . . I still think it might go through. This is just a really difficult week and it’s not been played very well politically, I don’t think, from the change in the law side at all. And they should learn the lessons from this week if they want to get it through. I still think it . . . I still think it might. Lucy Fisher
Robert? Robert Shrimsley
Well, I mean, like Stephen, I’m just not sure at this stage. I don’t think the majority was large enough to be totally confident that support won’t slip away. The only thing I would say is that the principle of assisted dying is very heavily supported in the country. And so although there are some very strong and strident voices against this in some newsrooms and some news organisations are coming out against this, there is a strong will for this in the general public. So, I mean, I still think on balance it will probably sneak through. But there are some rocky, rocky days ahead. And as I said, an element of me thinks at some point the government is gonna have to step in a little bit more aggressively than it has, even though it will have to remain a free vote right through. Lucy Fisher
And then, Robert, in the Lords, you know, I think we’re gonna hear a lot more faith-based arguments. Some have been put forward in the Commons. Is that a sort of a valid part of this debate? I’m just thinking back to when this all kicked off in the autumn. Lord Faulkner, former Lord Chancellor, who is very much kind of working with Kim Leadbeater on this bill, sort of stepped in when Shabana Mahmood, the first female Muslim in the cabinet, said she was sort of against it on faith-based grounds to say that actually, it was secular views that were more objective than spiritual objections. What do you think about that? Robert Shrimsley
It’s a difficult one, isn’t it, because on the one hand, you know, why should your faith affect my death? I don’t see why your religious views should govern my decision-making if I don’t share them. On the other hand, the one thing I will say is that I do think that when people openly oppose this on faith-based grounds, I have a lot more sympathy for them than when people who are fundamentally against this on faith-based grounds come up with other reasons to oppose it using issues like safeguarding or a sudden interest in hospice care or process. But at least people making the faith argument openly are being honest in their position. It’s not a view I agree with because I think people should be free to make their own decisions. And I’ve always thought it’s wrong that the only person with no say over how you die is the person doing the dying. But at least it’s open. Stephen Bush
I think also the thing which is really useful about the spiritual argument against it is it is important for all of us to reflect on the fact that if this legislation passes, that is a fundamental change, particularly given our particular model, our particular solution to the question of how do you get free-at-the-point-of-use healthcare, right? That is a major change in the type of state and the type of society that we are. So whether we’re godless atheists like myself or not, it is worth reflecting on the very useful challenge that the religious case against doing this does pose. And I think Robert’s exactly right. That’s actually much more helpful when it comes explicitly than like one of the reasons why this process hasn’t been good is that we’ve done, I think, collectively the political class has done a very poor job of discussing this legislation as well as it did in 2015, actually, I think. The other missing part, that sort of the dog hasn’t barked yet, is that we have a government that is basically going we don’t have a solution to this problem of social care yet, but the fix you do for social care does influence the level of protection from coercion, the incentives people will have to end their lives sooner because at the moment, we essentially do have a situation where if you get an illness, there’s a kind of genetic lottery of whether or not that will destroy and erode all of your family savings. And so I do think at some point, hopefully, we’ll realise we do have to discuss both sort of arm in arm the right to die and whatever the solution to the social care crisis is. Lucy Fisher
Because that’s one element is come into debate or at least come to the forefront this week, Laura, isn’t it, that someone could have a financial incentive that would be permissible in the choice they made about their death? If they had a terminal illness and six months to live, they might choose to die sooner to protect the savings that they left to their family. And there’s nothing in this legislation that would stop that. I think that’s a sort of argument that’s really fascinated a lot of people. Laura Hughes
It is, actually. And I think, though, as a society, we have to decide whether or not that is acceptable, actually. Is it OK legally for you to say that’s your reason — you want to protect your finances and pass it on to your family? Is that coercion or is that someone looking to look after their loved ones? Is it a good or a bad thing? That’s actually quite a difficult, I think, argument for the state to come down and say is right or wrong. Stephen Bush Not these things. The slight weirdness of that debate, and I’m aware I’m a hypocrite as the one who brought it up, right, is that the state says, if you put your family inheritance in a trust or a partnership, you can protect your inheritance in that way. But if at the end of my life I go, well, actually, I would quite like to be able to like leave my flat to my nephew, that’s apparently illegitimate. But if I put the flat in a trust, it would have been fine, you know. I mean, like, so we do already accept and indeed, it’s actually the most cherished thing.  It’s why inheritance tax is such a politically toxic thing to change. We do accept that most people prioritise leaving something for their children and their loved ones when they die. And so I think it is one of the most thorny parts of this debate, but it is actually a really important part to nail and get right because understandably, people do want their end-of-life decisions not to leave their families out of pocket. Laura Hughes And it’s something I think real families actually talk about and sometimes just sort of joke about. Don’t stick me in that care home and spend that much money. You know, we really do talk about it. And I think this bill and this whole conversation, these are the real human decisions that we’re all gonna have to make and that we are already talking about now. What is this law gonna mean for it?  And just on the religious point, I think, you know, it’s obviously a very calculated decision from some campaign groups not to talk about religion because they see society being one that doesn’t respond to those arguments in the way they might have done a hundred years ago. And that is why they’re doing it, but I agree, it’s also . . . It’s sometimes refreshing, actually, when you do have a religious figure coming out and saying it. And it’s hard to argue and counter against it. And it has been missing, I think, a little bit. People are scared about talking about it from that perspective, but it’s obviously a very valid one and you have your right to have it. Lucy Fisher And we should point out that there are secular organisations like Liberty, a human rights organisation, that, you know, is not supporting this legislation which is on purely secular grounds.  Robert, there have been 350 amendments tabled to this legislation. Are there any others in particular that have caught your eye that you think, you know, would be really good to improve it or should definitely be discarded? Robert Shrimsley Yes. I mean, I think the one that interested me is the amendment to try and extend the scope of this to cover people who have terrible degenerative illnesses like motor neurone disease, who I think currently are outside the scope of the measure or probably outside it.  Clearly, doctors can decide what is and isn’t a terminal diagnosis and those people are left outside to face a potentially very awful and painful death. But I think the issue here is that you’re trying to have a social, what I consider to be a social advance.  And you can’t let the best be the enemy of the good. And saying, no, look, we’re not going to include people with mental conditions, with mental health issues. We’re not going to have degenerative illnesses. You’ve got to be dying and dying quite soon before this is available to you is, I think, a way of providing some of the reassurances that people talk about when they say they don’t want coercive control, they don’t want people pushed into dying.  If you actually are able to say, look, this person probably only has six months to live. Maybe they’ll hang on for another four or four and a half and give up when the pain is too great. I think that gives you a degree of narrowness of the bill which says we are keeping this carefully controlled. Lucy Fisher
Stephen? Laura? Stephen Bush Well, yeah, I mean, I realise that also to me is the standout amendment, although I have the reverse perspective on it, which is that I completely get the argument that, you know, you don’t wanna scare the horses. And it’s this you’re asking people to take this quite big leap in terms of, you know, the type of country we are, etc.  But I think for so many people around the country, including people who follow politics closely, the thing they think will change with assisted dying is if you get a degenerative illness with an uncertain prognosis, you won’t die in incredible and avoidable agony.  I think if you want to have a procedure for the right to end your life that is safe, secure, all of the rest of it, you have to start, I think, from what most people’s idea of what that right would involve, which does include degenerative illnesses. It rightly, in my view, doesn’t include depression and other things like that. But I think the kind of the original sin, as it were, of this legislation is it’s focused a little bit, it’s focused far too much on reassuring people.  And that is why it’s ended up with this slight hodgepodge of not meeting the right that most people imagine and would like when they hear about this legislation and having a safeguard that either would be too hard to safeguard because in practice you wouldn’t get a court date or is inadequate for people who have degenerative illnesses. Laura Hughes Interesting, I asked Baroness Hale whether there are any other amendments that she was interested in that might change the shape of the bill and she spoke in favour and said it’d be a significant improvement to look at extending it to 12 months for applicants that do have these neurological conditions who might not have the mental capacity to make such a decision six months within the end of their life.  And I thought that was interesting. It just sort of felt if you’re going to do this, do it properly because you then avoid these arguments later down in the slippery slope. If you’re gonna expand it, do it. Now is the moment to move into it and make your argument and make it sensibly and well. But interesting, Kim Leadbeater doesn’t support extending it to 12 months. I’m not sure that one will get through. Lucy Fisher
Laura Hughes, public policy correspondent, thanks for joining. Laura Hughes Thank you, Lucy.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Lucy Fisher
We’ve also seen monumental movements on Ukraine this week. Donald Trump on Wednesday said that after talking to Russian President Vladimir Putin that their delegations would start negotiations immediately to end the war, blindsiding European capitals. Robert, what’s your reaction to this sort of seismic move of the past few days on Ukraine? Robert Shrimsley It’s quite a tricky one. I have to say actually my first instinct and my struggle was that there was a lot to be worried about here, that the steps that Donald Trump has taken is just gonna be me and Vladimir Putin sorting it all out, you know. We’re gonna come up with it. We’re gonna get Europe to pay and Europe to police it but they’re not gonna be in the room.  And Trump already saying he’s ruled out Nato membership and he’s ruled out any return to 2014 boundaries, even though I think both of those were where we were gonna end up. It felt like he’d given a lot away to Vladimir Putin from the outset and also added to comments made by Pete Hegseth, his defence secretary, about America not being the primary guarantor of defence of the security of Europe. This all seemed, and still, I think, seems very, very worrying.  However, I will just say I did read a little earlier a piece by Lawrence Friedman, which I think the FT is publishing today. And his argument was that actually, Trump has put Putin in a bit of a spot because he’s got to figure out what concessions he’s now prepared to make. And Trump has left him in this position where he’s got to make the next move. And none of these moves are necessarily as helpful to him as you think. So maybe my first reaction was overly worried. Lucy Fisher
That is interesting. I mean, Stephen, Robert is probably right that we just get to the end point faster, but Trump has kind of given up the negotiating position, hasn’t he, by making the concessions about the border and Nato membership? Stephen Bush Yeah. And also, as importantly, he’s underlined that he has no particular interest in the concerns or interests of the democracies of Europe, right? And then ultimately, it’s not just the content of what he said. Those were not conversations in which, you know, he talked to Ukraine first or talked to the EU27 or talked to the United Kingdom first, which underlines the existential challenge that it poses for all of us here in Europe and for governments to respond to that.  Lucy Fisher Well, it’s a good moment to sort of bring in what this means for the UK. Our Political Fix regular and colleague George Parker and I worked on a piece this week looking at the gap between what the Treasury wants to spend on defence, which is basically sticking to 2.3 per cent of GDP, what Labour has promised in its manifesto, which is 2.5 per cent of GDP, and what the military chiefs of the British forces are wanting to get to, which is 2.65 per cent. The difference with the Treasury and the military chiefs is worth about 10bn a year, so it is quite significant.  Robert, is this sort of pointless wrangling between different parts of the UK administration on this issue if there’s gonna need to be a Europe wide move to sort of boost defence spending and be more self-reliant and less reliant on the US? Robert Shrimsley
I think to a degree, yeah, but I think the fact is Britain, like a number of European countries, is going to have to spend more. And although, you know, one would expect the military to be making arguments that maximise the pressure on the government to give more money to their services, they are right. And I think the pressure to find the money somehow is going to be very, very acute. I have to say, not being a defence specialist myself, I always wonder about the argument that says the views defence spending as a percentage of GDP rather than saying, what do we need to spend it on? How can we spend it well? Are we spending it in the right way? But I suppose as a sort of lever to increase spending generally, it is the right thing. I don’t think there’s any room around this one, and I think the Treasury is gonna have to find a way to come up with the funding. And it’s not a simple matter. Lucy Fisher
And Stephen, you’ve been writing about this this week, how the government squares its economic imperative, funnelling more money into infrastructure and housing, plus its strategic imperative, more money for defence, with Rachel Reeves’ fiscal rules. Stephen Bush Yeah, and I think the problem is, parking for a moment the question about whether or not the government’s fiscal rule is the most well designed rule — spoiler alert, it’s not — you can’t really meet the aim of more spending for infrastructure, which obviously an economic imperative. The electoral imperative of make the public services a bit better and the security imperative of be able to defend ourselves and take action in our own theatre without private consumption taking a bit of a hit, right? So it’s very hard to see how she can do all of that without either breaking one of those imperatives or breaking that manifesto commitment on tax. It is very difficult.  I mean, I agree with Robert on percentage targets. I’m always reminded of the story about how the EU’s 3 per cent rule arose, which was when France’s then finance minister was like, well, we’re already at 1.5 so 2, that’s a bit too close. 2.5, that seems weirdly precise, so I guess it’s 3. And very much that the Nato target was, you know, the nations of Europe getting together after the premier and going, what should we do? Well, that number is something some of us already hit. That number’s a round figure. Oh, we’re gonna pick this one.  But for the United Kingdom in particular, whereas you know, you know much better than me, right? We’ve had a series of procurement failures. We have an MoD which many people think needs serious reform if it’s going to meet the same, and we do not have an armed forces that is capable of acting independently or doing power protection or any of the things that you would want it to do. In some ways, the percentage target is kind of a bit moot. Clearly, the number needs to go up quite a lot. Clearly, the MoD needs quite serious reforms and clearly none of that is compatible with the promises that the Labour party made at the last election. Lucy Fisher Well, it’s gonna be a big weekend as the Munich Security Conference takes place with David Lammy, John Healey and all sorts of other defence and foreign ministers from across Nato, including of course the US, jetting into Munich. And perhaps the slightly grim irony that this discussion about Ukraine will play out in a city forever associated with fairly catastrophic appeasement of Hitler.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  We’ve just got time left for stock picks. Robert, who are you buying or selling this week? Robert Shrimsley
OK. So I think the person I’m going to light upon is Liz Kendall, the welfare and pension secretary, because we’re not too far away now from what is promised to be the major plan on welfare reform, particularly on cutting the numbers of people on sickness benefit and cutting the sickness benefit bill, which is enormous. And I’ve been trying to debate whether I wanted to buy her or sell her on the basis of this, because there’s no question that going into this process is gonna upset an awful lot of people in her own party that if she does it properly, there are gonna be Labour MPs howling about withdrawal of benefits or making it much harder to keep benefits.  But I think in the end, I’m gonna buy her just because I think of my inherently optimistic and sunny nature that I just think this is such an important reform. It’s reform that’s got to work, not least for the reasons that Stephen was just outlining about the financial situation the government is in. I think welfare reform needs to really happen. And she is quite a tough reformer, so I’m gonna give her the benefit of doubt and buy her. Lucy Fisher
Stephen, how about you? Stephen Bush
I’m gonna cheat and I’m both going to sell Rachel Reeves, who obviously on the 27th of March is going to, you know, thanks to this combination of the OBR’s growth figures, these pressures on defence spending, etc, is going to stand up and do something highly unpopular, right? Whether it’s unpopular with the country, the markets, the Labour party or all three, if she’s really unlucky, it’s not gonna be a good couple of months to be a Treasury minister of any stripe and particularly not to be the chancellor. So that one, but I felt also I should sell Kemi Badenoch because I thought we should probably mention her particularly poor PMQs this week. Lucy Fisher
You’ve stolen mine. I was going to do that. Stephen Bush
Sorry. Lucy Fisher
No, no, go ahead. You say why you’re selling her and I’ll say why I’m selling her. Stephen Bush
You know, I just think, you know, the donors are unhappy, the MPs are . . . Now, she’s got a real problem in the chamber in that there are very few Conservative MPs. But, you know, she has that wall of silence behind her, which is never a good sign. The donors are unhappy because they don’t feel loved. And they also . . . They watch and they go like, well, if she’s not across this, what’s the point? You’ve got a resurgent party on the right.  And I just think . . . The thing I’ve been really struck by is the lack of an upward gradient. And so I just think she doesn’t seem to be turning it around, as, you know, you’ve written a very good piece about like, a hundred days, people think that you have until the devolved elections next year, which feels about right to me. But I just don’t think this is a set-up which is going to turn it around. And so I think the focus will be for most of the next year, well, if not her, who? Lucy Fisher
|I totally agree. And for me too, it was PMQs more than reaching the 100-day mark on Monday and some of the grumbles that came out of the woodwork there that did it for me because she kept asking the same question without reacting to the fact that Keir Starmer had responded. And then he said, you know, you need to deviate from the script, this is getting tedious. But yeah, I thought that was a weakness that just left me shaking my head. Well, that’s all we’ve got time for this week. Thanks for joining. Robert Shrimsley

[MUSIC PLAYING] ",2025-02-14,This is an audio transcript of the Political Fix podcast episode,"In this episode of the Political Fix podcast from the Financial Times, host Lucy Fisher and her colleagues discuss the contentious week in the UK Parliament regarding the assisted dying bill. A significant amendment was proposed that replaces the requirement for a High Court judge to approve applications for assisted dying with a panel of experts, which some MPs view as a weakening of safeguards and raising concerns about the bill’s viability.

The discussion reveals a divide among parliamentarians, with some arguing the change makes the process more feasible, while others worry it undermines the bill's integrity. The conversations around this legislation highlight deep societal debates about end-of-life decisions and ethical considerations, particularly regarding the potential for coercion in financial circumstances.

Additionally, the podcast touches on the implications of recent U.S. political moves on Ukraine and how they affect Britain’s defense strategies amid existing tensions regarding military spending. The conversation advances into the operational challenges Britain faces in balancing its economic and defense needs, especially with upcoming international discussions on security.

Ultimately, the panel reflects on the uncertainty surrounding the passage of the assisted dying bill, considering various amendments and public sentiment, while also emphasizing the need for thorough consideration of complex ethical issues related to the right to die."

Lucy Fisher
Hello, I’m Lucy Fisher and this is Political Fix from the Financial Times. Coming up, Keir Starmer is straining to retain his business-as-usual approach to Donald Trump. But for how much longer? And what will happen when Trump’s spotlight inevitably falls on the UK? Plus, Reform tops Labour and the Tories in a major national opinion poll for the first time ever. Is it a blip or a sign that the UK’s two-party system could be in trouble? To discuss it all we have in the studio, my FT colleagues Robert Shrimsley. Hi, Robert.

Robert Shrimsley
Hey, Lucy.

Lucy Fisher
George Parker. Hi, George.

George Parker
Hi, Lucy.

Lucy Fisher
And the FT’s chief foreign affairs commentator, Gideon Rachman. Hi, Gideon.

Gideon Rachman Hi.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Lucy Fisher
Gideon, so with more than two-and-a-half weeks into Trump 2.0 . . . 

Gideon Rachman
Only that, yeah.

Lucy Fisher
Only that. And so far, the UK has remained unscathed by any punitive actions. We’ll see how long that lasts. I just wondered if you can sum up for us in this very early days, what’s been different about Trump 2.0 from what we predicted or foresaw before he returned to the Oval Office?

Gideon Rachman
Well, I mean, I think it’s even more frenetic than the first term. And I think one thing, certainly as somebody who follows foreign policy, that’s really interesting because it was unanticipated and hard to find something about Trump that nobody had thought of.

But this expansionist, imperialist bit, you know, who knew that his first big foreign policy moves would be to lay claim to Greenland, to Canada, actually, and suggest Canada should become the 51st state; to suggest that he might invade Panama and now actually suggest he wants to annex Gaza.

So that was very new because I think a lot of people’s reading of the battles within Trump world of American foreign policy was that there was one group who were kind of traditional neoconservatives — muscular America should dominate the world and push back against Russia and China, and that they were losing out. There was Mike Pompeo, etc, didn’t get a job.

And the second group were felt to be what were called restrainers. They would call themselves restrainers; others would call them isolationists who were sort of no, the lesson of the last 20 years is we must do much less of this, pull back. And it looked like those were the guys that were winning, the neo-isolationists.

And then suddenly Trump comes in and says, oh by the way, we want to take Greenland and take Gaza. And I want to see these guys because I saw them, you know, last face-to-face in Washington in December. And some of them were saying to me, well, you know, we understand that Trump has all these drawbacks. But, you know, on this central issue, he’s right. And that’s why we’re backing him. And I wonder what they’re thinking now, what anybody’s thinking.

Lucy Fisher
Well, there’s a lot there that I wanna get into. Robert, what’s your sense of why Trump has been, and all things are relative, so sort of welcoming towards Britain and Keir Starmer in most of his public pronouncements, even when he said the UK was out of line when it comes to tariffs? He sort of compared that with the EU, which he said was really out of line and an atrocity.

Robert Shrimsley
Well, I mean, on the tariffs point, on the trade surplus and deficit and the fact is that it’s the UK’s trade deficit and he seems much more focused on goods than services. Trade surplus is nothing like comparable to the EU. So if he was working down a list of places I’ve got to whack, the UK just would be quite a long way down in that respect.

We know there is a sort of residual affection for the EU. I don’t know how much it’s really worth, but it’s there in his mind at least, not so much the people around him. He’s susceptible to charm to an extent. So, you know, if Keir Starmer, David Lammy, they go over, they schmoozed him quite well and that counts for a little bit. Won’t count for much for very long the moment there’s an issue. But he’s got to...

Also, I think one just has to slightly aim off above what he says in these kind of thing because, you know, he was quite complimentary about North Korea at one point. You know, the truth is, he says, ah, he’s a great guy. We get on really well. I love this place. And then the next day, whack. So just as I think one should be careful of the pronouncements of people around Trump about what they’ll do to the UK, one also has to be a little bit careful about taking at face value when he’s nice about you as well.

George Parker
Robert, you said, by the way, residual affection for the EU. Did you mean the UK?

Robert Shrimsley
I did mean the UK. That’s just how embedded it is in FT thinking. (Lucy and George laugh)

George Parker
We just can’t get past . . . You’ve got your chip inserted.

Lucy Fisher
George, what’s your take? Is it slightly random why Trump’s doing this or has he got a strategy here that so far Starmer has stayed in line, really tried to avoid criticising him for the most part, even to the sort of detriment of not coming out in favour of Denmark when its territorial sovereignty is threatened. What do you think’s going on?

George Parker
It’s not very glorious, is it? But keeping your head down seems to be the main strategy being adopted by Keir Starmer. And you can’t blame him. There are a whole load of people who will be egging him on in his party to be much more critical of President Trump. He’s got the Liberal Democrats saying he should be taking a much tougher line on Trump, but he’s got the national interests and people’s economic interests in mind and keeping your head down, trying to avoid the the tariff wrath of Trump is not a bad thing to do.

I agree with Robert that, you know, Britain’s not high on this list of targets in terms of the trade imbalance, but there’s some rather convenient US trade stats calculated in a different way than UK ones which show that America is actually running a surplus in trade in goods with the UK, which is very helpful. And British ministers are relying on those data rather than the British ones.

There’s the whole golf club connection, the ancestral connection to Scotland, the royal family, all those things. I think also there’s a bit of a sense that if you’re basically declaring a rhetorical war on everyone, including Canada, you need to have someone out there, the good guys, you know, an exemplar of what you could be. And Britain is not a bad one. It shares a language. Britain’s paying its way in Nato, sort of, and is seen as a (inaudible). And so why not, you know, put someone on the good step. But it probably won’t last.

Gideon Rachman
But there is Elon Musk, you know. I mean, what does one make of that?

Robert Shrimsley
I think there are two other points. One is that if your strategic interest, if you are Trump, is in keeping Europe apart, weakening that trading bloc then not punishing, not doing things that make Britain want to hold closer to Europe, is this (inaudible).

The other point is there is an element which it’s sensible government policy not to feed the trolls. I mean, American government is at times seems like just logging on to Twitter and the anger and fury and, you know. So when you want to be critical, doing it privately rather than performatively with somebody like Trump seems just true to me.

Lucy Fisher
Gideon.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah. I mean, I think that the people in government were rattled by Elon Musk’s tweets, but they rightly thought, well — I mean, right in retrospect — thought probably best not to respond and see what it all means. I mean, it may come back.

But I think that there is Musk himself. We don’t know how powerful he is over the long term. Is this gonna last? But he has got a sort of idée fixe about Britain and Muslim rape gangs and all of that. And I don’t think that is going away and that there are all theories about who he’s in touch with in Britain and why he’s you know, there were days when he was, with all everything on his plate, more than half his tweets were about Britain. And that, I think, is a bit concerning.

But then beyond the immediate, I think that the government has to begin thinking through worst-case scenarios about the United States. It may be that it’s OK, but what if it isn’t? Because our foreign policy over 80 years has made us more and more enmeshed, foreign policy and national security policy, with the United States. Our nuclear weapons are dependent on America. Our intelligence gathering is dependent on America. That’s the heart of the national security state.

What if the old America’s gone? What if Trump is serious about undermining Nato? What if he does a deal with Russia that we feel imperils our own security? What if we don’t trust, as we don’t, the head of their director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, and you know, she sees everything. She may not make the big decisions, but, you know, say, an intelligence source that you don’t want revealed, do you really trust her with it? Those are very profound questions.

Lucy Fisher
George, how much thinking do you think is really going on in Whitehall about some of the worst-case scenarios that Gideon has outlined? I mean, you’ve been writing a bit this week about tariffs and what happens there. They’ve left open the door for tit-for-tat tariffs, but the impact could be seismic across many sectors.

George Parker
Yeah, just on the tariff fronts, they have drawn up contingency plans for the eventuality that there’s a maybe a 10 per cent tariff levied on British exports. And the tone has changed actually over the last few months. When I speak to Jonathan Reynolds, the business and trade secretary, here at the FT back in December, the very strong impression was that if America did put tariffs on the UK, we wouldn’t respond because tariffs are bad for everyone. Consumers are hurt and we’re an advocate of free trade.

Over the last couple of months, things have shifted slightly because of the rhetoric coming out of the White House and also the fact that President Trump’s talking about tariffs not just as a way of dealing with trade anomalies, as he would see it, but also just as a way of raising revenues for tax cuts in America.

Gideon Rachman
Or that, indeed, even just as a political weapon, you know.

George Parker
Or as a political weapon, yeah. So that’s sort of seen a bit of a hardening of position. So they are drawing up plans for potential retaliation if Britain’s hit by tariffs. And it’s the familiar list that we know about because it was a relic of our days in the EU where they target products made in red states. So the classic Harley-Davidson, the Levi’s jeans, playing cards, which I’ve got about, I think, made in Kentucky.

But as you say, Lucy, and as Gideon was just pointing out, this goes far beyond tariffs. And Keir Starmer’s whole approach has been, and he made this clear in his Mansion House speech before Christmas, about wanting to avoid the choice between Europe and America, that, you know, Churchill didn’t choose that. They didn’t choose. I don’t want to choose. But there could come a point where it gets so bad in America that you do have to make some kind of a choice to do.

Lucy Fisher
Does he need to do that in public, Robert? I was very struck that on Tuesday, Keir Starmer hosted Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, for dinner in Downing Street, and there was very fudgy language in the official Number 10 readout afterwards saying, we discussed the need for greater co-operation in the high north and Arctic. And then it was Frederiksen who came out and said, well, behind closed doors, he gave his support to Denmark on Greenland. Does he need to be more public when it comes to allies like Denmark, who are European neighbours and fellow members of Nato?

Robert Shrimsley
It’s a really tough call, isn’t it? I mean, I think he needs to be clear in private communications. And I think European nations, other Nato allies need to believe that those messages will come through from Britain. As I said, whether you want to up the rhetoric publicly, whether there’s a win in doing so, I know Denmark’s actually dialled back quite a lot in the extent to which it’s actually challenging Trump. It’s clearly rather preferring the hope that, you know, it can just let this slide and he’ll focus on other things. I don’t know if that’s realistic.

But I don’t know that there is a win for Britain, and in the end that’s what Starmer has to focus on the most in being out there defying and being bellicose and being anti-Trump in the way lots of people would like him to be before that need really arises. So I think the case for caution and for trying to play both sides is clearly the right one. As both George and Gideon said, whether that’s viable long term, I don’t know. But it seems like the best course until it obviously isn’t.

George Parker
What’s interesting in the readout of that meeting from Downing Street, there was a line which said prime minister and the Danish prime minister agree that Greenland was part of Denmark. So there was a very sotto voce advocacy of what the British position is on that, as indeed there was in the British position about a two-state solution in the Middle East and Palestinians having a sovereign state. But you know, what you’re seeing is a pattern where the prime minister will state in a quiet sort of way what the British position is, but without wanting to make a massive row about it with Trump.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah. But we’re already feeling some of the backwash of some stuff that’s happening in Washington. Just as a footnote, but, you know, USAID contracts have been cancelled all over the world. Well, the Foreign Office is a big foreign aid donor and uses a lot of the same contractors, who may now be going out of business. So those kinds of things, you know, you can’t just always put your head down.

Lucy Fisher
No. The stack of cards topples. Gideon, on the Gaza intervention Trump made this week suggesting it could become the Riviera of the Middle East. I mean, just to zoom out a bit. What on earth is going on here? Is it the case that he just has no sense of history, no understanding of the knotty politics of the region? Is it that he is a real estate developer who just literally thinks about it like a plot of land to be rebuilt?

Gideon Rachman
I think both.

Lucy Fisher
OK. (Laughter)

Gideon Rachman
Yeah, I don’t think he’s particularly immersed or interested in the details of history or the history of the Middle East or whatever. And I think he is a real estate developer. I mean, I was thinking maybe he thinks of Gaza as a bit like the Hudson Yards, which was a sort of undeveloped bit of New York, when everyone said, oh God, it’s hopeless, we’ll never do anything with that (inaudible). Ah, I have the vision that we can do something with this. And he did.

But, you know, Gaza is a bit different from the Hudson Yards because you’re not dealing with the Teamsters union. You’re dealing with Hamas. So even tougher dudes than the Teamsters union. So, you know, it’s crazy. But I think that one of the things that interests me watching this is what do people like Rubio, the secretary of state, or Waltz, the national security adviser. How long can they go on pretending that this is a sane proposal? Maybe forever? I don’t know. I mean, or maybe even they’re a bit like . . . 

Robert Shrimsley
Even the White House walking back a little bit, wasn’t it? He’s not clear, is he?

Gideon Rachman
Yeah, but Trump is (overlapping speech), but Trump has said it again. He said, we’re gonna . . . Israel’s gonna hand over Gaza to us, which is problematic on many levels. So he’s not gonna walk it back, but I think everybody’s hoping that yeah, as with the Danes, or his attention will move off. But, you know, there’s this whole lot theory about American foreign policy. There’s the madman theory that, you know, you pretend to be a madman. But what if it’s not a theory? What if he actually is a madman? (Laughter)

Robert Shrimsley
And I mean, about Greenland. I mean, he was talking about Greenland in the first term as well. This isn’t a new idée fix, even if he’s pushing it harder.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah, but can it? That’s a new one.

Robert Shrimsley Yeah.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Lucy Fisher
I’ve got to bring in George. Been looking forward to talking about this: your wonderful, if I may say so, Magazine interview with Peter Mandelson. He’s returning to Washington this week as the new UK ambassador to the US. So my favourite lines were him insisting he’s not “wokey-cokey” defending Trump as an antidote to disenchanted Americans. And I’ll be able to read one of the highlight quotes of the piece on air.

George Parker
Well, no, not really. But I’m sure the bleep machine will deal with it. I basically left this question till relatively close to the end of the interview with Peter Mandelson. We were on a train heading up to Manchester and I asked him about his relationship with the convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein.

And he said that he regretted having met Jeffrey Epstein, being introduced to him by Maxwell. And he most of all regretted the harm done to young women. And then he said, I don’t want to get into this any further. This is an FT obsession and you can all f** off, OK? And a chill descended, I have to say, on carriage J of the Avanti North West trains, and then we carried on with the interview.

But I mean, look, he doesn’t like being asked about it, but there are a whole load of really interesting things in that interview. It was a very interesting and easy, in a way, interview to write because every quote was golden and Peter Mandelson always delivers like that. He’s an intriguing character. You know, his Achilles heel is he’s drawn to wealth. The converse of that is that wealthy people are drawn to him because he oozes intrigue, power, influence, gossip, mischief.

And, you know, in that respect he’s an intriguing and possibly a, you know, inspired choice as Britain’s ambassador to Washington. So there’s been a lot of commentary in the in the media about him telling me to f** off. And it came up at the lobby briefing in Number 10 where questions are being asked about whether Keir Starmer agreed with his new ambassador telling the FT to f** off and whether the prime minister would use a similar term in conversation with the FT to his political editor and so on.

But I thought one of the interesting things that Peter Mandelson said was about how Britain sees itself in the post-Brexit era in relation to America and Europe, because Peter Mandelson, arch pro-European former EU commissioner, says he still believes Brexit is the most harmful thing done to Britain’s national interests in his lifetime.

But he says we either have to sink or swim. He’s determined that we should swim. And he said that we should make a virtue in America of being not Europe, which I thought was a really interesting way to describe it, this idea that Britain can be a more lightly regulated economy, closer to America, particularly in areas like technology and data and AI and so forth, and to draw distinction between us and the sort of more heavily regulated European Union economy, which he was extremely critical of.

Lucy Fisher
Robert, I mean, Peter Mandelson agrees to have a 4,000-word profile of him written in the FT and says in the middle of it he wants to stay below the radar. How is it gonna pan out in Washington?

Robert Shrimsley
It’s really interesting, but I think Peter Mandelson finds it very hard to stay below the radar, to operate quietly. But he is good at palace intriguing and he is good at, you know, being a courtier. So he’ll be good at identifying people worth talking to and trying to persuade them. And he’s got this wonderful Lutyens mansion you can invite people to. There are perks and trimmings with the job.

I think the interesting question is just going to be what the British media and some of the American media, how they manage him and how he manages them. Clearly, the British media will see him as a story. All of a sudden they’ll be looking for he’s been writing it up. But on the other hand, he might go to manage them by giving them information. So he might have to manage that relationship. The American media are much trickier, particularly those on the right who want to go after him. He’s a big target.

Lucy Fisher
Gideon, what’s your sense of how he’ll go down in Washington?

Gideon Rachman
Hard to tell. I mean, you know, I think Washington is pretty self-absorbed at the moment for obvious reasons. So I wouldn’t assume there would be that much focus on him, but I’m not sure. You say he’s very good at intrigue and obviously he is. But this is a whole level of craziness that he will never have dealt with. I mean in Brussels . . . (Overlapping speech)

George Parker
Even in the European.

Robert Shrimsley
(Overlapping speech) in Labour during the Michael (overlapping speech).

Gideon Rachman
He was and all of that. But even so, I don’t think you’ve ever seen something like Elon Musk or Donald Trump at the heart. So everybody’s head is spinning. If he is capable of making a cool assessment of what’s happening and finding a way forward for Britain, hat’s off to him. But I think it’s gonna be extremely difficult. And then just on a personal level, because these guys are so volatile, he has to be prepared for the possibility that whether he deserves it or not, they decide to go for him. They may love him.

Robert Shrimsley
But presumably one of the questions is one of the many ways that Trump’s position is not normal is that it’s not necessarily obvious who speaks for him, if anybody does; who has access to him, which ears of the right he is to bend at any one time.

Gideon Rachman
No, absolutely. And he may be caught up in the crossfire between them. I mean, it was very interesting that, for example, that Chris LaCivita, who managed Trump’s campaign, obviously got on very well with the current British ambassador, Karen Pierce, and said it’s an absurd appointment. You know, Mandelson’s a washed out guy. But then LaCivita, how powerful is he now? Who knows?

Lucy Fisher
Robert, one of the lingering issues that’s a huge obsession in the UK but we know is not a priority for the Trump administration in their early weeks is what happens regarding the Chagos Islands, this deal between the UK and Mauritius. It’s been quite a bumpy week on that front.

Robert Shrimsley
Yeah. I mean, I think partly because the Mauritian premier put out information which I think were some things decided wasn’t correct, which appeared to have doubled the cost of what Britain was paying only from £9bn to 1£8bn. I think those figures have been pushed back on this (inaudible) down.

But look, this is a tricky one for the government because on the one hand, this deal has been a long time in the making. It started under the Conservatives, a long time under the Conservatives.

And the history of Britain’s time in the Chagos Islands is a very bad and dark episode in British colonial history, the way we treated the Chagossians. So it’s a problematic period, but it now has this incredibly important Indian Ocean base. From a national security point of view it’s very important, particularly important, I think, to America. And so the whole priority of the British government, it seems to me, has been how do we secure this as best we can? And Labour have decided the best way to secure it, having had an adverse judgment in the interest of course of justice about this is to pay Mauritius lots of money, take a 99-year lease and worry about it again in 100 years.

And the difficulty is people are now making a lot of arguments against it now, particularly homing in on Richard Hermer, the attorney-general. I think this is part of his obsession with international law. We’re doing something we don’t need to do. The case we lost wasn’t definitive. Why are we paying these people to . . .?

It’s become very problematic. It’s one of those ones where you can see in Foreign Office diplomatic circles why Britain is going the way it’s going. But it’s also quite hard to argue against people saying, why are we giving them money to take away an asset? It’s a tricky one.

Lucy Fisher
And also, you mentioned that the fate of the Chagossians. They’ve not been involved in these negotiations at all.

Robert Shrimsley
One of the issues that nobody’s talking about is that actually, Mauritius’s claim is fundamentally (inaudible). They administered it for us when Britain owned Mauritius as well. And there’s no great love for the Mauritians or from the Mauritians to the islanders.

Gideon Rachman
I mean, I think one way of thinking about it is that one of the things that Trump signals is that we’re moving away from a period when international law was good and imperialism was bad to a phrase when in Trump’s view, international law is useless and imperialism apparently is back and might is right.

So the Chagos decision makes sense in the previous era that, you know, we’ve lost an international ruling. We’d also lost massively a vote at the UN. This is an embarrassment in any way. It’s an imperial legacy. So let’s do a deal that gives us access to the base if we pay a bit of money. And actually, the Biden administration thought that was an OK deal. But we’re now in the Trump era.

Robert Shrimsley
There is also the interesting point that if you’re Britain, a mid power, you’re not in a major power bloc. Actually, international law is your friend most of the time so sticking with it has advantages for Britain.

Lucy Fisher
And George, the domestic politics here . . . I mean, the right have really leapt on Starmer, even though we should point out that it was the Conservatives themselves in 2022 who opened negotiations. Multiple foreign secretaries, Liz Truss, James Cleverly, David Cameron had some dealings with Port Louis on this. This week, Robert Jenrick went, I think, further than anyone so far in calling Starmer a quisling over his plans to, you know...

Gideon Rachman
It’s outrageous.

Lucy Fisher
To give the islands to Mauritius. What do you make of that?

George Parker
Well, I mean, yeah, it’s obviously become a cause célèbre for the Conservative right, for Reform UK and obviously for the Conservative press. And it’s been running as a huge story about Starmer being a, you know, a surrender monkey sort of international lawyer bending the knee and all the rest of it — some sort of woke agenda to give up our colonies.

I thought he handled it rather well at prime minister’s question time this week. He made a big thing about the fact that he’d seen the national security advice and the security advice and he knew — he wasn’t gonna tell us, but he knew this was really important. And then he implied that Kemi Badenoch could have known the security reasons for this decision, but had chosen not to go to briefings and so on. So that was . . . I thought he handled it rather well.

We are still in this difficult situation, as Robert was just describing, where, you know, Labour people are starting to get quite anxious about this as well. You know, the size of the bill, the fact you can’t really explain why you’re doing it, you can’t say how much you’re handing over, there’s a lot more difficult decisions to come on public spending and ministers are feeling the pinch. And you’re starting to see briefings appearing of ministers and senior people in the government starting to complain about this policy.

So they will be hoping very much that Jonathan Powell — as you reported this week, Lucy, is going for talks in Washington on this — will be able to get this deal over the line very quickly and that Trump will go along with it.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah, didn’t Powell negotiate it himself personally, more or less?

George Parker
He did.

Lucy Fisher
Yes, exactly. He was the envoy to these talks before he became national security adviser.

Robert Shrimsley
Have you been surprised, Gideon, that the Trump administration hasn’t reacted to this? We’ve been sitting around waiting for the shoe to drop and it hasn’t actually happened yet, has it?

Gideon Rachman
But, you know.

Robert Shrimsley
Just not important.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah, I don’t think so. It matters a lot in Britain, but so far it hasn’t cropped up there. But, or maybe, this is one thing on which they’ll be conventional, but they don’t seem to be conventional on much.

George Parker
There’ve been two phone calls, I think, between Trump and Starmer, and neither of them has Trump mentioned the Chagos Islands.

Gideon Rachman
But I think that’s the thing about Trump. I mean, you know, do you think he’s really across the detail? He might try and build a hotel, though? I don’t know. But . . . 

Lucy Fisher
Because we call it a joint UK-US base on the largest atoll in this archipelago in the Indian Ocean, Diego Garcia. But actually, really, it is run by the Americans. It’s where they have nuclear-capable submarines and bombers. It’s of huge strategic interest to the US, isn’t it?

Gideon Rachman
Yeah, I mean, and particularly, you know, in this era of heightened tensions with China, it’s pretty key to the whole Pacific stance, you know.

Robert Shrimsley
I mean, I have to . . . The Robert Jenrick thing, and even in the years we’ve now had of the coarsening of the political debate, the abuse, the Trumpification of the way people use Twitter, to see a member of the Conservative shadow cabinet referring to the prime minister as a quisling — you know, a Norwegian collaborator with the Nazis who ends up being shot by his own country — and to compare the prime minister to a quisling, to use that word, it just as though the descent into inanity and appalling-ness that people who are supposed to be serious politicians are engaging. I’m genuinely staggered by this.

Gideon Rachman
It’s horrible. But I also . . . I think it’s frightening because it tells me where he thinks politics is going. I mean, he’s not a stupid person.

Robert Shrimsley
By all means, fight the deal, but . . . 

Lucy Fisher
And Robert, just for anyone, any listener, who doesn’t really understand what quisling means, explain.

Robert Shrimsley
So Quisling was the leader of Norway after the Nazis took it over. He was a collaborator, essentially, and he collaborated with the Nazis and ended up being shot by his own people. And so you’re calling him a Nazi collaborator and traitor. If I’m the prime minister, you know, by all means, say it’s a bad deal, by all means question his judgment, but for heaven’s sake.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah. I mean, I think in the good old days, he would have been sacked from the shadow cabinet for doing that, but it’s now . . . 

Robert Shrimsley
Rightly.

Gideon Rachman
 . . . Inexplicable. I mean, that would never happen now. Never.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Lucy Fisher
Well, it’s also been a big week for Reform UK. I mentioned at the top that the first national major opinion poll put the party ahead of Labour and the Conservatives for the first time. Reform has been polling ahead of the Tories consistently for some weeks. And I want to consider whether the hype is actually outpacing reality.

But first, Gideon, while we’ve got you here, obviously, Farage is great friends with Donald Trump. Does the sort of the march of Maga in the US, is that a headwind or a tailwind for Reform, do you think?

Gideon Rachman
I think for the moment it’s helpful to Reform, the link with Trump, because, you know, he’s the man, he’s the president, Farage is a mate of his. And a lot of people in Britain, or least those who might be attracted to vote for Reform, are still in the phase where they’re thinking Trump’s pretty cool and he’s getting a lot done, you know, he’s not politically correct, he’s not woke.

And it makes Farage seem like he’s in the slipstream of history. He’s heading in the right way. But I think that there must be a danger for Reform — that if Trump blows up or if he becomes so extreme that he begins to alienate opinion in Europe, that maybe the link between Trump and Reform would be damaging for Farage.

But for the moment, I think it’s still a plus for him, and I think it’s good for their morale as well. They just think, as Viktor Orbán I think once said, you know, we used to think that Europe was our future, now we know we’re the future of Europe. And I think Farage must feel that he is the future of Britain when he looks at what’s going on in America.

Lucy Fisher
George, what do you make of these polls? How much credence are you giving them? I put in the show notes a great article by our colleague Jonny Vincent, very data-rich piece that shows that third parties always tend to underperform their opinion poll peaks at actual elections.

And he shows whether it’s the Lib Dems in the 2010s or the SDP in the 1980s or indeed Ukip or the Brexit party in the past 10 years, sometimes they get these great surges in the opinion polls, but they can never quite live up to them when voters go to the ballot box.

George Parker
Yeah, that’s true. Well, I mean, some of us — probably not you, Lucy, I’m afraid to say — will remember the good old days of the Liberal-SDP Alliance. And in 1983, the alliance, under Roy Jenkins and David Steel, famously got 25 per cent of the votes.

Robert Shrimsley
“Go back to your constituencies and prepare for government.”

George Parker
Exactly. And they won 23 seats. And so in those days, of course, that was a split in the left of politics, the Labour and the SDP. And now we’ve got a split on the right. So it’s entirely conceivable that Reform could sustain the kind of levels of vote we’re seeing in the opinion polls at the moment, around 25 per cent, the same sort of level, and not have a major breakthrough at the next general election.

However, we don’t know where the ceiling is. People talk about, you know, a finger in the air and say the ceiling for Reform UK might be 28, might be 30 per cent. Well, who knows? You know, if the Tory vote collapses and people start to fail to spot the difference between the Conservative party where Robert Jenrick talks about quislings and Reform UK and there’s more of a buzz, as Gideon says, about Nigel Farage and you know, who knows where their ceiling is.

So I think it’s gonna be a very interesting six months for Reform UK. We think they’re gonna do extremely well in the local elections on May the 1st. We’ve seen this week that there have been some elections have been cancelled because of a local government reorganisation. But nevertheless, the Conservatives are defending over 900 seats and Reform UK, I think, are defending about half a dozen, aren’t they? Something like that.

Lucy Fisher
I think four.

George Parker
Four? Exaggerated. (Laughter) So you can see the sort of the dynamic that can play out there and that will feed into this whole idea of Reform being on the march and being part of the zeitgeist. You know, but the one thing you have to say about Reform UK, you know, you wrote a very good Notebook about this, Lucy, this week is it’s a new party. They don’t have that big solid base of party activists. They don’t have a long track record. They’ve attracted a load of people who you might say are not exactly on the mainstream of politics. And quite often people at the top of Reform UK and its predecessors, Ukip and Brexit party, ended up hating each other. So there are a lot of things that can go wrong.

Gideon Rachman
That’s very Trumpy. I mean, there’s been . . . they hate each other.

George Parker
But I think for the next few months at least, we’re gonna hear an awful lot about Reform.

Lucy Fisher
Robert, Reform are crying foul over this delay that George mentioned to council elections in May that were due to take place in nine areas in southern England, which they say are their heartlands. They’re going to happen next year because they’re merging two tiers of local authority administration. That’s the government’s argument. Nigel Farage said this is a connivance between a terrified Labour party and Tory councillors who also want to hold on to their income for another year. Is that betrayal narrative useful to them? Is this going to kind of curb their ability to really make progress in May?

Robert Shrimsley
Well, I mean, as George said, they’ve got lots of places where they still have hopes. Clearly, some of the big ones, like Essex County Council, was one of the ones they were really hoping to make a major challenge in, and that’s been lost to them. So the betrayal narrative, I don’t know how much focus do people ever spend on local council elections, let alone what date they are, whether they’re this year or next year.

If I were Nigel Farage, I’d argue this too, but whether it really will make a difference in the long run, I think, you know, and the reality of this is there is a logical argument for why the government has chosen not to allow those elections to go forward when you’re set to abolish councils.

On the other hand, it won’t have escaped anybody’s attention. This won’t do Reform any good, and that’s a happy coincidence for them.

Lucy Fisher
It is in some ways getting quite a kind of Maga argument that people are being disenfranchised, you know, the suggestion that scrapping a layer of local government, which is what Labour are proposing to do, is part of a ploy to take people’s rights away from them.

Gideon Rachman
Sure. Absolutely, I mean, that’s the style of argument where whether or not you know that it’s untrue doesn’t really bother you. You deploy the argument anyway and you play to the conspiracy theory, the idea that there’s an elite out there that’s scheming against you and that wants to thwart the will of the people and that you represent the will of the people. And yet, the playbook is very, very similar.

Robert Shrimsley
And this is the central point. This is where Trump, I think, helps Farage. And it just creates a different atmosphere of politics that you can slip (inaudible). But the point is, the fundamental argument of Reform UK is that British politics has been a conspiracy against a significant segment of the population denying them the truth. The two parties, he calls them a uniparty, doesn’t he, Labour and the (inaudible) that they are all together in this conspiracy and only we are standing up for what you want. And that’s a powerful argument. He’s a very, very powerful advocate of this argument and it resonates with a lot of people, particularly when they’re feeling the household incomes are stuck, their public services don’t work. So there’s this huge opportunity for Reform.

And let’s remember, the last election, Labour and the Conservatives together got 57 per cent of the vote. That’s the lowest they’ve ever had since the Labour party became a major party in this country. Lowest combined vote. So disaffection is there. I mean, the question of whether Reform is being hyped, in the end, I think comes down to whether you believe that Labour can recover, whether Labour over the course of four years — and it is still a long time — can get the economy moving in the right direction, improve public services and persuade people that normal politics does work for them. And that’s the whole ball game. If they can’t, then I think you’re looking at a Reform or Conservative-like Reform government. Yeah.

Lucy Fisher
And Robert, I loved your column this week in which you made the argument that Labour won as a party for change, but it’s failing to sort of harness that insurgent energy in the way it’s governing. And I quote, you say, somehow we’ve reached a place where Labour is seen as the party of the status quo and it’s the right that represents change.

Robert Shrimsley
Yeah, I mean, to be fair, that wasn’t me saying that. It was an ally of Morgan McSweeney. But I did use that quote and I think it’s a really powerful point that they sit there looking at how we can be the change that stops our voters, the underprivileged voters, the underpaid voters, the people who aren’t graduates, the people who voted for Brexit, basically — how can we get them back? They voted for change. We have to look like we are a change.

And the thing is, in some sense it’s unfair. It’s early in the government. They are doing some quite big transformational things on planning reform and infrastructure, on clean energy. Those are the areas where they’ve been really sluggish and where is this health reform (inaudible) for it. If infrastructure and planning is the big thing, why hasn’t this legislation come through yet?

And I think that lack of urgency, but also partly it’s just Keir Starmer’s demeanour. He doesn’t look hungry and angry. He doesn’t have the flair that Donald Trump has for moves that show whose side you’re on. So in this month, Rachel Reeves has called in regulators, given them a carpeting for standing in the way of growth, got rid of the head of the Competition and Markets Authority. And it’s been quite a quiet, British, very decorous way. You could just imagine how that would be done in Trump land.

And the thing is, whether you approve of Trump or not, what he has acquired is a mastery of the medium and the political messaging. And Labour simply hasn’t captured that.

Lucy Fisher
George, Kemi Badenoch’s clearly rattled. It seems perhaps no coincidence that this week, the week of this big poll, she decided to unveil her first major policy as leader of the Tories around immigration, very much a Reform-facing area.

George Parker
Yes, I mean, it feels a little bit like panic, doesn’t it? I thought Kemi Badenoch wasn’t going to announce any new policies. We’re sort of meant to be in a period of listening and rebuilding trust and policies could wait. And the fact she’s been forced to wheel out a policy, a rather sort of backward envelope, it seemed to me, about how long you have to be in the country before you can qualify for a British passport.

Playing straight . . . I mean, you speak to people in Kemi Badenoch’s team and they say they can’t clear the ground for Farage. They have to take Farage on the question of immigration and they can’t leave the ground clear for him. They’ve got to acknowledge the mistakes they made in government. I personally think this is a big strategic mistake by the Conservative party. They’ve got an appalling record to defend. You can’t out-Farage Farage on this question, and Farage will always say, well, look, when you were in office, 900,000 people came in a single year. Why should anyone believe a word you say on the subject?

And to keep flagging up as your number one priority, initially where you’re probably at your weakest and playing into the hands of your number one political opponent, it just seems to me, you know, I’ve heard . . . (overlapping speech)

Gideon Rachman
(Overlapping speech) alternative, George. Do they have to then turn around and say, well, actually, we think immigration’s a good thing?

George Parker
I see what the alternative is. They could do what Kemi Badenoch did at prime minister’s question on the week before and talk about academy schools and the fact that the Labour government seems to be reversing some of the reforms that middle-class, traditional Tory voters think are important for their kids.

Gideon Rachman
To change the subject.

George Parker
To change the subject. I mean, I think they’re playing with fire and it’s taking them down really dangerous roads. And we’ve talked about the quisling comments by Robert Jenrick. It’s almost a bidding war in the Conservative party to be more and more rightwing.

And all the time that’s happening, and we’ll see this in the local elections, you drive even more people, sort of traditional Tory supporters in the shires where they’re having these elections on May the 1st, straight into the hands of the Liberal Democrats.

Lucy Fisher
Gideon, some people think the UK has had its populist moment already with Brexit, and that’s in the past. You’re shaking your head already.

Others point out, you know, the global trend for rightwing populist parties being on the march. Tell us a bit about what’s going on across the rest of the world — the AfD in Germany . . . 

Gideon Rachman
Yeah. No, I’d love to believe that, you know, because I grew up with a kind of sentimental view of Britain as this moderate country that wouldn’t . . . would never, you know, we didn’t succumb to fascism, etc. My faith in the inherent moderation of the British was slightly shaken by the whole Brexit period when people became very angry with each other in a way that seemed a bit foreign to us.

And then, as you say, looking at the rest of the world, I think it’s very complacent to think that we can’t be affected by this. It just we may be out of phase with it. I think that is the case. For the moment, Britain looks like an island of, can I say, sanity. We have a boring, possibly not terribly competent government, but a centrist government with a big majority. And that’s not what’s happening in the rest of the world. But if they fail, you can see that the Front National or the Rassemblement National, as they’re now called, they could win the next French presidential election.

The AfD will find out next month how strong they are, but they’re gaining in Germany. The far right have just gone into government in Austria, they’re in government in Hungary, they’re in government in Slovakia. They’re in government, I would argue, in the United States. So very complacent if anyone were to say it couldn’t happen here.

And I had a rather chilling conversation with (inaudible). Just a friend who’s a labour activist in Suffolk, you know, I bumped into and he said to me, I can feel the Labour vote just moving to Reform in the east of England. And he said, rather gloomily, I think we may have seen the last, that this might be the last ever Labour government. And I said, OK, maybe that’s a bit extreme. But he made a quite interesting parallel to me, which he said Keir Starmer could be Britain’s François Hollande, as in somebody who wins quite big and you think, oh, the socialists are back. And then by the end of his term, his party’s in ruins.

Robert Shrimsley
Well, happy new year. (Laughter)

George Parker
We’ve got one every week. Bloody hell.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Lucy Fisher
We’ve just got time left for Political Fix stock picks. Robert, who are you buying or selling?

Robert Shrimsley
OK, just before I tell you who I am buying or selling, I have to remind who I have dallied with. I gave very serious thought to selling John Swinney, the Scottish First Minister. (Laughter)

Lucy Fisher
But remind him.

Robert Shrimsley
Of course, I’ve heard the most hilarious story with a . . . A report came out, a sort of governmental report or semi-government report saying that cats should be banned in some areas because of the damage it had to do on wildlife. It wasn’t government policy of the Scottish Government. He said it wasn’t, but he’s had to spend the whole week running around denying that Scotland is about to ban cats.

Lucy Fisher
And then there was some suggestion it wasn’t banning cats, but it was . . . It would be forcing citizens to keep them on leads. (Laughter)

Robert Shrimsley
It was a disaster and it’s obviously not gonna happen. But one of those funny things where he can’t escape it. But who I’m actually going to sell is Richard Hermer, the attorney-general, because I think he has become far too visible for the good of the government and he’s a close friend of Keir Starmer. He was hunted unexpectedly to become attorney-general.

And he’s a really strong human rights international lawyer who clearly accords and aligns with what Starmer believes. So it’s not that I think he’s immediately about to be sacked, but I think he’s become too visible. And I always thought this would happen. He’d become a danger point for the government. I don’t know when it’s gonna happen, but I do think it will.

Lucy Fisher
George, how about you?

George Parker
This is gonna be slightly unexpected, I think, but I’m gonna go for Angela Rayner.

Lucy Fisher
Oh, I was gonna buy her too. Are you . . . Oh, sorry, are you buying or selling her?

George Parker
I’m buying her.

Lucy Fisher
OK, yeah.

George Parker
I’m buying Angela Rayner. I’ll tell you why. This is gonna sound very boring and technical, but she’s getting rid of an entire tier of local government. This should have happened 30 or 40 years ago. If you speak to Michael Heseltine, it’s one of his big regrets that he didn’t get rid of all these stupid district councils.

You know, we’ve got far too much local government. There’s kind of your county councils, district councils, parish councils. She’s sweeping it away. She’s continuing and accelerating the drive started under the previous Conservative government of having elected mayors as well. I think that’s what people want. They want strong local figures running streamlined local councils. It’s a bit boring, but I’m buying Angela Rayner.

Robert Shrimsley
You wait, they’ll come back. Twenty years, they’ll bring them all back.

Lucy Fisher
(Laughter) Well, I was gonna buy her as well, George, because I agree with you. And to sort of bounce off a point that you made earlier, Robert, about how sluggish Labour have been in many areas, in planning they are going fast to change things and I’m not convinced necessarily they’re gonna meet their very ambitious housing target.

But I think she has gripped quite a difficult department and I know she’s got a big battle coming up on whether to water down this huge package of workers’ rights that, guess what, business hate. And I think she’s not to be underestimated in a political skirmish.

Robert Shrimsley
I actually think she goes to the point we were discussing earlier about someone who can speak to voters and cut through with them. Now she’s a bit Marmite. Some people don’t like her, but as an authentic voice of ordinary people, she has that strength that Keir Starmer doesn’t have.

Lucy Fisher
Gideon, how about you?

Gideon Rachman
Well, you guys are the experts, so I’ll make a very obvious choice. I would sell Kemi Badenoch. I think that for all the reasons we discussed, she’s in trouble, and I don’t really see her turning it around, particularly since this is the Conservative party that doesn’t give people time and tends to panic.

Gideon, so with more than two-and-a-half weeks into Trump 2.0 . . .  Gideon Rachman
Only that, yeah. Lucy Fisher
Only that. And so far, the UK has remained unscathed by any punitive actions. We’ll see how long that lasts. I just wondered if you can sum up for us in this very early days, what’s been different about Trump 2.0 from what we predicted or foresaw before he returned to the Oval Office? Gideon Rachman
Well, I mean, I think it’s even more frenetic than the first term. And I think one thing, certainly as somebody who follows foreign policy, that’s really interesting because it was unanticipated and hard to find something about Trump that nobody had thought of. But this expansionist, imperialist bit, you know, who knew that his first big foreign policy moves would be to lay claim to Greenland, to Canada, actually, and suggest Canada should become the 51st state; to suggest that he might invade Panama and now actually suggest he wants to annex Gaza. So that was very new because I think a lot of people’s reading of the battles within Trump world of American foreign policy was that there was one group who were kind of traditional neoconservatives — muscular America should dominate the world and push back against Russia and China, and that they were losing out. There was Mike Pompeo, etc, didn’t get a job. And the second group were felt to be what were called restrainers. They would call themselves restrainers; others would call them isolationists who were sort of no, the lesson of the last 20 years is we must do much less of this, pull back. And it looked like those were the guys that were winning, the neo-isolationists. And then suddenly Trump comes in and says, oh by the way, we want to take Greenland and take Gaza. And I want to see these guys because I saw them, you know, last face-to-face in Washington in December. And some of them were saying to me, well, you know, we understand that Trump has all these drawbacks. But, you know, on this central issue, he’s right. And that’s why we’re backing him. And I wonder what they’re thinking now, what anybody’s thinking. Lucy Fisher
Well, there’s a lot there that I wanna get into. Robert, what’s your sense of why Trump has been, and all things are relative, so sort of welcoming towards Britain and Keir Starmer in most of his public pronouncements, even when he said the UK was out of line when it comes to tariffs? He sort of compared that with the EU, which he said was really out of line and an atrocity. Robert Shrimsley
Well, I mean, on the tariffs point, on the trade surplus and deficit and the fact is that it’s the UK’s trade deficit and he seems much more focused on goods than services. Trade surplus is nothing like comparable to the EU. So if he was working down a list of places I’ve got to whack, the UK just would be quite a long way down in that respect. We know there is a sort of residual affection for the EU. I don’t know how much it’s really worth, but it’s there in his mind at least, not so much the people around him. He’s susceptible to charm to an extent. So, you know, if Keir Starmer, David Lammy, they go over, they schmoozed him quite well and that counts for a little bit. Won’t count for much for very long the moment there’s an issue. But he’s got to... Also, I think one just has to slightly aim off above what he says in these kind of thing because, you know, he was quite complimentary about North Korea at one point. You know, the truth is, he says, ah, he’s a great guy. We get on really well. I love this place. And then the next day, whack. So just as I think one should be careful of the pronouncements of people around Trump about what they’ll do to the UK, one also has to be a little bit careful about taking at face value when he’s nice about you as well. George Parker
Robert, you said, by the way, residual affection for the EU. Did you mean the UK? Robert Shrimsley
I did mean the UK. That’s just how embedded it is in FT thinking. (Lucy and George laugh) George Parker
We just can’t get past . . . You’ve got your chip inserted. Lucy Fisher
George, what’s your take? Is it slightly random why Trump’s doing this or has he got a strategy here that so far Starmer has stayed in line, really tried to avoid criticising him for the most part, even to the sort of detriment of not coming out in favour of Denmark when its territorial sovereignty is threatened. What do you think’s going on? George Parker
It’s not very glorious, is it? But keeping your head down seems to be the main strategy being adopted by Keir Starmer. And you can’t blame him. There are a whole load of people who will be egging him on in his party to be much more critical of President Trump. He’s got the Liberal Democrats saying he should be taking a much tougher line on Trump, but he’s got the national interests and people’s economic interests in mind and keeping your head down, trying to avoid the the tariff wrath of Trump is not a bad thing to do. I agree with Robert that, you know, Britain’s not high on this list of targets in terms of the trade imbalance, but there’s some rather convenient US trade stats calculated in a different way than UK ones which show that America is actually running a surplus in trade in goods with the UK, which is very helpful. And British ministers are relying on those data rather than the British ones. There’s the whole golf club connection, the ancestral connection to Scotland, the royal family, all those things. I think also there’s a bit of a sense that if you’re basically declaring a rhetorical war on everyone, including Canada, you need to have someone out there, the good guys, you know, an exemplar of what you could be. And Britain is not a bad one. It shares a language. Britain’s paying its way in Nato, sort of, and is seen as a (inaudible). And so why not, you know, put someone on the good step. But it probably won’t last. Gideon Rachman
But there is Elon Musk, you know. I mean, what does one make of that? Robert Shrimsley
I think there are two other points. One is that if your strategic interest, if you are Trump, is in keeping Europe apart, weakening that trading bloc then not punishing, not doing things that make Britain want to hold closer to Europe, is this (inaudible). The other point is there is an element which it’s sensible government policy not to feed the trolls. I mean, American government is at times seems like just logging on to Twitter and the anger and fury and, you know. So when you want to be critical, doing it privately rather than performatively with somebody like Trump seems just true to me. Lucy Fisher
Gideon. Gideon Rachman
Yeah. I mean, I think that the people in government were rattled by Elon Musk’s tweets, but they rightly thought, well — I mean, right in retrospect — thought probably best not to respond and see what it all means. I mean, it may come back. But I think that there is Musk himself. We don’t know how powerful he is over the long term. Is this gonna last? But he has got a sort of idée fixe about Britain and Muslim rape gangs and all of that. And I don’t think that is going away and that there are all theories about who he’s in touch with in Britain and why he’s you know, there were days when he was, with all everything on his plate, more than half his tweets were about Britain. And that, I think, is a bit concerning. But then beyond the immediate, I think that the government has to begin thinking through worst-case scenarios about the United States. It may be that it’s OK, but what if it isn’t? Because our foreign policy over 80 years has made us more and more enmeshed, foreign policy and national security policy, with the United States. Our nuclear weapons are dependent on America. Our intelligence gathering is dependent on America. That’s the heart of the national security state. What if the old America’s gone? What if Trump is serious about undermining Nato? What if he does a deal with Russia that we feel imperils our own security? What if we don’t trust, as we don’t, the head of their director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, and you know, she sees everything. She may not make the big decisions, but, you know, say, an intelligence source that you don’t want revealed, do you really trust her with it? Those are very profound questions. Lucy Fisher
George, how much thinking do you think is really going on in Whitehall about some of the worst-case scenarios that Gideon has outlined? I mean, you’ve been writing a bit this week about tariffs and what happens there. They’ve left open the door for tit-for-tat tariffs, but the impact could be seismic across many sectors. George Parker
Yeah, just on the tariff fronts, they have drawn up contingency plans for the eventuality that there’s a maybe a 10 per cent tariff levied on British exports. And the tone has changed actually over the last few months. When I speak to Jonathan Reynolds, the business and trade secretary, here at the FT back in December, the very strong impression was that if America did put tariffs on the UK, we wouldn’t respond because tariffs are bad for everyone. Consumers are hurt and we’re an advocate of free trade. Over the last couple of months, things have shifted slightly because of the rhetoric coming out of the White House and also the fact that President Trump’s talking about tariffs not just as a way of dealing with trade anomalies, as he would see it, but also just as a way of raising revenues for tax cuts in America. Gideon Rachman
Or that, indeed, even just as a political weapon, you know. George Parker
Or as a political weapon, yeah. So that’s sort of seen a bit of a hardening of position. So they are drawing up plans for potential retaliation if Britain’s hit by tariffs. And it’s the familiar list that we know about because it was a relic of our days in the EU where they target products made in red states. So the classic Harley-Davidson, the Levi’s jeans, playing cards, which I’ve got about, I think, made in Kentucky. But as you say, Lucy, and as Gideon was just pointing out, this goes far beyond tariffs. And Keir Starmer’s whole approach has been, and he made this clear in his Mansion House speech before Christmas, about wanting to avoid the choice between Europe and America, that, you know, Churchill didn’t choose that. They didn’t choose. I don’t want to choose. But there could come a point where it gets so bad in America that you do have to make some kind of a choice to do. Lucy Fisher
Does he need to do that in public, Robert? I was very struck that on Tuesday, Keir Starmer hosted Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, for dinner in Downing Street, and there was very fudgy language in the official Number 10 readout afterwards saying, we discussed the need for greater co-operation in the high north and Arctic. And then it was Frederiksen who came out and said, well, behind closed doors, he gave his support to Denmark on Greenland. Does he need to be more public when it comes to allies like Denmark, who are European neighbours and fellow members of Nato? Robert Shrimsley
It’s a really tough call, isn’t it? I mean, I think he needs to be clear in private communications. And I think European nations, other Nato allies need to believe that those messages will come through from Britain. As I said, whether you want to up the rhetoric publicly, whether there’s a win in doing so, I know Denmark’s actually dialled back quite a lot in the extent to which it’s actually challenging Trump. It’s clearly rather preferring the hope that, you know, it can just let this slide and he’ll focus on other things. I don’t know if that’s realistic. But I don’t know that there is a win for Britain, and in the end that’s what Starmer has to focus on the most in being out there defying and being bellicose and being anti-Trump in the way lots of people would like him to be before that need really arises. So I think the case for caution and for trying to play both sides is clearly the right one. As both George and Gideon said, whether that’s viable long term, I don’t know. But it seems like the best course until it obviously isn’t. George Parker
What’s interesting in the readout of that meeting from Downing Street, there was a line which said prime minister and the Danish prime minister agree that Greenland was part of Denmark. So there was a very sotto voce advocacy of what the British position is on that, as indeed there was in the British position about a two-state solution in the Middle East and Palestinians having a sovereign state. But you know, what you’re seeing is a pattern where the prime minister will state in a quiet sort of way what the British position is, but without wanting to make a massive row about it with Trump. Gideon Rachman
Yeah. But we’re already feeling some of the backwash of some stuff that’s happening in Washington. Just as a footnote, but, you know, USAID contracts have been cancelled all over the world. Well, the Foreign Office is a big foreign aid donor and uses a lot of the same contractors, who may now be going out of business. So those kinds of things, you know, you can’t just always put your head down. Lucy Fisher
No. The stack of cards topples. Gideon, on the Gaza intervention Trump made this week suggesting it could become the Riviera of the Middle East. I mean, just to zoom out a bit. What on earth is going on here? Is it the case that he just has no sense of history, no understanding of the knotty politics of the region? Is it that he is a real estate developer who just literally thinks about it like a plot of land to be rebuilt? Gideon Rachman
I think both. Lucy Fisher
OK. (Laughter) Gideon Rachman
Yeah, I don’t think he’s particularly immersed or interested in the details of history or the history of the Middle East or whatever. And I think he is a real estate developer. I mean, I was thinking maybe he thinks of Gaza as a bit like the Hudson Yards, which was a sort of undeveloped bit of New York, when everyone said, oh God, it’s hopeless, we’ll never do anything with that (inaudible). Ah, I have the vision that we can do something with this. And he did. But, you know, Gaza is a bit different from the Hudson Yards because you’re not dealing with the Teamsters union. You’re dealing with Hamas. So even tougher dudes than the Teamsters union. So, you know, it’s crazy. But I think that one of the things that interests me watching this is what do people like Rubio, the secretary of state, or Waltz, the national security adviser. How long can they go on pretending that this is a sane proposal? Maybe forever? I don’t know. I mean, or maybe even they’re a bit like . . .  Robert Shrimsley
Even the White House walking back a little bit, wasn’t it? He’s not clear, is he? Gideon Rachman
Yeah, but Trump is (overlapping speech), but Trump has said it again. He said, we’re gonna . . . Israel’s gonna hand over Gaza to us, which is problematic on many levels. So he’s not gonna walk it back, but I think everybody’s hoping that yeah, as with the Danes, or his attention will move off. But, you know, there’s this whole lot theory about American foreign policy. There’s the madman theory that, you know, you pretend to be a madman. But what if it’s not a theory? What if he actually is a madman? (Laughter) Robert Shrimsley
And I mean, about Greenland. I mean, he was talking about Greenland in the first term as well. This isn’t a new idée fix, even if he’s pushing it harder. Gideon Rachman
Yeah, but can it? That’s a new one. Robert Shrimsley Yeah.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Lucy Fisher
I’ve got to bring in George. Been looking forward to talking about this: your wonderful, if I may say so, Magazine interview with Peter Mandelson. He’s returning to Washington this week as the new UK ambassador to the US. So my favourite lines were him insisting he’s not “wokey-cokey” defending Trump as an antidote to disenchanted Americans. And I’ll be able to read one of the highlight quotes of the piece on air. George Parker
Well, no, not really. But I’m sure the bleep machine will deal with it. I basically left this question till relatively close to the end of the interview with Peter Mandelson. We were on a train heading up to Manchester and I asked him about his relationship with the convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein. And he said that he regretted having met Jeffrey Epstein, being introduced to him by Maxwell. And he most of all regretted the harm done to young women. And then he said, I don’t want to get into this any further. This is an FT obsession and you can all f** off, OK? And a chill descended, I have to say, on carriage J of the Avanti North West trains, and then we carried on with the interview. But I mean, look, he doesn’t like being asked about it, but there are a whole load of really interesting things in that interview. It was a very interesting and easy, in a way, interview to write because every quote was golden and Peter Mandelson always delivers like that. He’s an intriguing character. You know, his Achilles heel is he’s drawn to wealth. The converse of that is that wealthy people are drawn to him because he oozes intrigue, power, influence, gossip, mischief. And, you know, in that respect he’s an intriguing and possibly a, you know, inspired choice as Britain’s ambassador to Washington. So there’s been a lot of commentary in the in the media about him telling me to f** off. And it came up at the lobby briefing in Number 10 where questions are being asked about whether Keir Starmer agreed with his new ambassador telling the FT to f** off and whether the prime minister would use a similar term in conversation with the FT to his political editor and so on. But I thought one of the interesting things that Peter Mandelson said was about how Britain sees itself in the post-Brexit era in relation to America and Europe, because Peter Mandelson, arch pro-European former EU commissioner, says he still believes Brexit is the most harmful thing done to Britain’s national interests in his lifetime. But he says we either have to sink or swim. He’s determined that we should swim. And he said that we should make a virtue in America of being not Europe, which I thought was a really interesting way to describe it, this idea that Britain can be a more lightly regulated economy, closer to America, particularly in areas like technology and data and AI and so forth, and to draw distinction between us and the sort of more heavily regulated European Union economy, which he was extremely critical of. Lucy Fisher
Robert, I mean, Peter Mandelson agrees to have a 4,000-word profile of him written in the FT and says in the middle of it he wants to stay below the radar. How is it gonna pan out in Washington? Robert Shrimsley
It’s really interesting, but I think Peter Mandelson finds it very hard to stay below the radar, to operate quietly. But he is good at palace intriguing and he is good at, you know, being a courtier. So he’ll be good at identifying people worth talking to and trying to persuade them. And he’s got this wonderful Lutyens mansion you can invite people to. There are perks and trimmings with the job. I think the interesting question is just going to be what the British media and some of the American media, how they manage him and how he manages them. Clearly, the British media will see him as a story. All of a sudden they’ll be looking for he’s been writing it up. But on the other hand, he might go to manage them by giving them information. So he might have to manage that relationship. The American media are much trickier, particularly those on the right who want to go after him. He’s a big target. Lucy Fisher
Gideon, what’s your sense of how he’ll go down in Washington? Gideon Rachman
Hard to tell. I mean, you know, I think Washington is pretty self-absorbed at the moment for obvious reasons. So I wouldn’t assume there would be that much focus on him, but I’m not sure. You say he’s very good at intrigue and obviously he is. But this is a whole level of craziness that he will never have dealt with. I mean in Brussels . . . (Overlapping speech) George Parker
Even in the European. Robert Shrimsley
(Overlapping speech) in Labour during the Michael (overlapping speech). Gideon Rachman
He was and all of that. But even so, I don’t think you’ve ever seen something like Elon Musk or Donald Trump at the heart. So everybody’s head is spinning. If he is capable of making a cool assessment of what’s happening and finding a way forward for Britain, hat’s off to him. But I think it’s gonna be extremely difficult. And then just on a personal level, because these guys are so volatile, he has to be prepared for the possibility that whether he deserves it or not, they decide to go for him. They may love him. Robert Shrimsley
But presumably one of the questions is one of the many ways that Trump’s position is not normal is that it’s not necessarily obvious who speaks for him, if anybody does; who has access to him, which ears of the right he is to bend at any one time. Gideon Rachman
No, absolutely. And he may be caught up in the crossfire between them. I mean, it was very interesting that, for example, that Chris LaCivita, who managed Trump’s campaign, obviously got on very well with the current British ambassador, Karen Pierce, and said it’s an absurd appointment. You know, Mandelson’s a washed out guy. But then LaCivita, how powerful is he now? Who knows? Lucy Fisher
Robert, one of the lingering issues that’s a huge obsession in the UK but we know is not a priority for the Trump administration in their early weeks is what happens regarding the Chagos Islands, this deal between the UK and Mauritius. It’s been quite a bumpy week on that front. Robert Shrimsley
Yeah. I mean, I think partly because the Mauritian premier put out information which I think were some things decided wasn’t correct, which appeared to have doubled the cost of what Britain was paying only from £9bn to 1£8bn. I think those figures have been pushed back on this (inaudible) down. But look, this is a tricky one for the government because on the one hand, this deal has been a long time in the making. It started under the Conservatives, a long time under the Conservatives. And the history of Britain’s time in the Chagos Islands is a very bad and dark episode in British colonial history, the way we treated the Chagossians. So it’s a problematic period, but it now has this incredibly important Indian Ocean base. From a national security point of view it’s very important, particularly important, I think, to America. And so the whole priority of the British government, it seems to me, has been how do we secure this as best we can? And Labour have decided the best way to secure it, having had an adverse judgment in the interest of course of justice about this is to pay Mauritius lots of money, take a 99-year lease and worry about it again in 100 years. And the difficulty is people are now making a lot of arguments against it now, particularly homing in on Richard Hermer, the attorney-general. I think this is part of his obsession with international law. We’re doing something we don’t need to do. The case we lost wasn’t definitive. Why are we paying these people to . . .? It’s become very problematic. It’s one of those ones where you can see in Foreign Office diplomatic circles why Britain is going the way it’s going. But it’s also quite hard to argue against people saying, why are we giving them money to take away an asset? It’s a tricky one. Lucy Fisher
And also, you mentioned that the fate of the Chagossians. They’ve not been involved in these negotiations at all. Robert Shrimsley
One of the issues that nobody’s talking about is that actually, Mauritius’s claim is fundamentally (inaudible). They administered it for us when Britain owned Mauritius as well. And there’s no great love for the Mauritians or from the Mauritians to the islanders. Gideon Rachman
I mean, I think one way of thinking about it is that one of the things that Trump signals is that we’re moving away from a period when international law was good and imperialism was bad to a phrase when in Trump’s view, international law is useless and imperialism apparently is back and might is right. So the Chagos decision makes sense in the previous era that, you know, we’ve lost an international ruling. We’d also lost massively a vote at the UN. This is an embarrassment in any way. It’s an imperial legacy. So let’s do a deal that gives us access to the base if we pay a bit of money. And actually, the Biden administration thought that was an OK deal. But we’re now in the Trump era. Robert Shrimsley
There is also the interesting point that if you’re Britain, a mid power, you’re not in a major power bloc. Actually, international law is your friend most of the time so sticking with it has advantages for Britain. Lucy Fisher
And George, the domestic politics here . . . I mean, the right have really leapt on Starmer, even though we should point out that it was the Conservatives themselves in 2022 who opened negotiations. Multiple foreign secretaries, Liz Truss, James Cleverly, David Cameron had some dealings with Port Louis on this. This week, Robert Jenrick went, I think, further than anyone so far in calling Starmer a quisling over his plans to, you know... Gideon Rachman
It’s outrageous. Lucy Fisher
To give the islands to Mauritius. What do you make of that? George Parker Well, I mean, yeah, it’s obviously become a cause célèbre for the Conservative right, for Reform UK and obviously for the Conservative press. And it’s been running as a huge story about Starmer being a, you know, a surrender monkey sort of international lawyer bending the knee and all the rest of it — some sort of woke agenda to give up our colonies.  I thought he handled it rather well at prime minister’s question time this week. He made a big thing about the fact that he’d seen the national security advice and the security advice and he knew — he wasn’t gonna tell us, but he knew this was really important. And then he implied that Kemi Badenoch could have known the security reasons for this decision, but had chosen not to go to briefings and so on. So that was . . . I thought he handled it rather well.  We are still in this difficult situation, as Robert was just describing, where, you know, Labour people are starting to get quite anxious about this as well. You know, the size of the bill, the fact you can’t really explain why you’re doing it, you can’t say how much you’re handing over, there’s a lot more difficult decisions to come on public spending and ministers are feeling the pinch. And you’re starting to see briefings appearing of ministers and senior people in the government starting to complain about this policy.  So they will be hoping very much that Jonathan Powell — as you reported this week, Lucy, is going for talks in Washington on this — will be able to get this deal over the line very quickly and that Trump will go along with it. Gideon Rachman
Yeah, didn’t Powell negotiate it himself personally, more or less? George Parker
He did. Lucy Fisher
Yes, exactly. He was the envoy to these talks before he became national security adviser. Robert Shrimsley
Have you been surprised, Gideon, that the Trump administration hasn’t reacted to this? We’ve been sitting around waiting for the shoe to drop and it hasn’t actually happened yet, has it? Gideon Rachman
But, you know. Robert Shrimsley
Just not important. Gideon Rachman
Yeah, I don’t think so. It matters a lot in Britain, but so far it hasn’t cropped up there. But, or maybe, this is one thing on which they’ll be conventional, but they don’t seem to be conventional on much. George Parker
There’ve been two phone calls, I think, between Trump and Starmer, and neither of them has Trump mentioned the Chagos Islands. Gideon Rachman
But I think that’s the thing about Trump. I mean, you know, do you think he’s really across the detail? He might try and build a hotel, though? I don’t know. But . . .  Lucy Fisher
Because we call it a joint UK-US base on the largest atoll in this archipelago in the Indian Ocean, Diego Garcia. But actually, really, it is run by the Americans. It’s where they have nuclear-capable submarines and bombers. It’s of huge strategic interest to the US, isn’t it? Gideon Rachman
Yeah, I mean, and particularly, you know, in this era of heightened tensions with China, it’s pretty key to the whole Pacific stance, you know. Robert Shrimsley
I mean, I have to . . . The Robert Jenrick thing, and even in the years we’ve now had of the coarsening of the political debate, the abuse, the Trumpification of the way people use Twitter, to see a member of the Conservative shadow cabinet referring to the prime minister as a quisling — you know, a Norwegian collaborator with the Nazis who ends up being shot by his own country — and to compare the prime minister to a quisling, to use that word, it just as though the descent into inanity and appalling-ness that people who are supposed to be serious politicians are engaging. I’m genuinely staggered by this. Gideon Rachman
It’s horrible. But I also . . . I think it’s frightening because it tells me where he thinks politics is going. I mean, he’s not a stupid person. Robert Shrimsley
By all means, fight the deal, but . . .  Lucy Fisher
And Robert, just for anyone, any listener, who doesn’t really understand what quisling means, explain. Robert Shrimsley
So Quisling was the leader of Norway after the Nazis took it over. He was a collaborator, essentially, and he collaborated with the Nazis and ended up being shot by his own people. And so you’re calling him a Nazi collaborator and traitor. If I’m the prime minister, you know, by all means, say it’s a bad deal, by all means question his judgment, but for heaven’s sake. Gideon Rachman
Yeah. I mean, I think in the good old days, he would have been sacked from the shadow cabinet for doing that, but it’s now . . .  Robert Shrimsley
Rightly. Gideon Rachman
 . . . Inexplicable. I mean, that would never happen now. Never. [MUSIC PLAYING] Lucy Fisher Well, it’s also been a big week for Reform UK. I mentioned at the top that the first national major opinion poll put the party ahead of Labour and the Conservatives for the first time. Reform has been polling ahead of the Tories consistently for some weeks. And I want to consider whether the hype is actually outpacing reality.  But first, Gideon, while we’ve got you here, obviously, Farage is great friends with Donald Trump. Does the sort of the march of Maga in the US, is that a headwind or a tailwind for Reform, do you think? Gideon Rachman I think for the moment it’s helpful to Reform, the link with Trump, because, you know, he’s the man, he’s the president, Farage is a mate of his. And a lot of people in Britain, or least those who might be attracted to vote for Reform, are still in the phase where they’re thinking Trump’s pretty cool and he’s getting a lot done, you know, he’s not politically correct, he’s not woke.  And it makes Farage seem like he’s in the slipstream of history. He’s heading in the right way. But I think that there must be a danger for Reform — that if Trump blows up or if he becomes so extreme that he begins to alienate opinion in Europe, that maybe the link between Trump and Reform would be damaging for Farage.  But for the moment, I think it’s still a plus for him, and I think it’s good for their morale as well. They just think, as Viktor Orbán I think once said, you know, we used to think that Europe was our future, now we know we’re the future of Europe. And I think Farage must feel that he is the future of Britain when he looks at what’s going on in America. Lucy Fisher George, what do you make of these polls? How much credence are you giving them? I put in the show notes a great article by our colleague Jonny Vincent, very data-rich piece that shows that third parties always tend to underperform their opinion poll peaks at actual elections.  And he shows whether it’s the Lib Dems in the 2010s or the SDP in the 1980s or indeed Ukip or the Brexit party in the past 10 years, sometimes they get these great surges in the opinion polls, but they can never quite live up to them when voters go to the ballot box. George Parker
Yeah, that’s true. Well, I mean, some of us — probably not you, Lucy, I’m afraid to say — will remember the good old days of the Liberal-SDP Alliance. And in 1983, the alliance, under Roy Jenkins and David Steel, famously got 25 per cent of the votes. Robert Shrimsley
“Go back to your constituencies and prepare for government.” George Parker Exactly. And they won 23 seats. And so in those days, of course, that was a split in the left of politics, the Labour and the SDP. And now we’ve got a split on the right. So it’s entirely conceivable that Reform could sustain the kind of levels of vote we’re seeing in the opinion polls at the moment, around 25 per cent, the same sort of level, and not have a major breakthrough at the next general election.  However, we don’t know where the ceiling is. People talk about, you know, a finger in the air and say the ceiling for Reform UK might be 28, might be 30 per cent. Well, who knows? You know, if the Tory vote collapses and people start to fail to spot the difference between the Conservative party where Robert Jenrick talks about quislings and Reform UK and there’s more of a buzz, as Gideon says, about Nigel Farage and you know, who knows where their ceiling is.  So I think it’s gonna be a very interesting six months for Reform UK. We think they’re gonna do extremely well in the local elections on May the 1st. We’ve seen this week that there have been some elections have been cancelled because of a local government reorganisation. But nevertheless, the Conservatives are defending over 900 seats and Reform UK, I think, are defending about half a dozen, aren’t they? Something like that. Lucy Fisher
I think four. George Parker
Four? Exaggerated. (Laughter) So you can see the sort of the dynamic that can play out there and that will feed into this whole idea of Reform being on the march and being part of the zeitgeist. You know, but the one thing you have to say about Reform UK, you know, you wrote a very good Notebook about this, Lucy, this week is it’s a new party. They don’t have that big solid base of party activists. They don’t have a long track record. They’ve attracted a load of people who you might say are not exactly on the mainstream of politics. And quite often people at the top of Reform UK and its predecessors, Ukip and Brexit party, ended up hating each other. So there are a lot of things that can go wrong. Gideon Rachman
That’s very Trumpy. I mean, there’s been . . . they hate each other. George Parker
But I think for the next few months at least, we’re gonna hear an awful lot about Reform. Lucy Fisher
Robert, Reform are crying foul over this delay that George mentioned to council elections in May that were due to take place in nine areas in southern England, which they say are their heartlands. They’re going to happen next year because they’re merging two tiers of local authority administration. That’s the government’s argument. Nigel Farage said this is a connivance between a terrified Labour party and Tory councillors who also want to hold on to their income for another year. Is that betrayal narrative useful to them? Is this going to kind of curb their ability to really make progress in May? Robert Shrimsley Well, I mean, as George said, they’ve got lots of places where they still have hopes. Clearly, some of the big ones, like Essex County Council, was one of the ones they were really hoping to make a major challenge in, and that’s been lost to them. So the betrayal narrative, I don’t know how much focus do people ever spend on local council elections, let alone what date they are, whether they’re this year or next year.  If I were Nigel Farage, I’d argue this too, but whether it really will make a difference in the long run, I think, you know, and the reality of this is there is a logical argument for why the government has chosen not to allow those elections to go forward when you’re set to abolish councils.  On the other hand, it won’t have escaped anybody’s attention. This won’t do Reform any good, and that’s a happy coincidence for them. Lucy Fisher
It is in some ways getting quite a kind of Maga argument that people are being disenfranchised, you know, the suggestion that scrapping a layer of local government, which is what Labour are proposing to do, is part of a ploy to take people’s rights away from them. Gideon Rachman
Sure. Absolutely, I mean, that’s the style of argument where whether or not you know that it’s untrue doesn’t really bother you. You deploy the argument anyway and you play to the conspiracy theory, the idea that there’s an elite out there that’s scheming against you and that wants to thwart the will of the people and that you represent the will of the people. And yet, the playbook is very, very similar. Robert Shrimsley And this is the central point. This is where Trump, I think, helps Farage. And it just creates a different atmosphere of politics that you can slip (inaudible). But the point is, the fundamental argument of Reform UK is that British politics has been a conspiracy against a significant segment of the population denying them the truth. The two parties, he calls them a uniparty, doesn’t he, Labour and the (inaudible) that they are all together in this conspiracy and only we are standing up for what you want. And that’s a powerful argument. He’s a very, very powerful advocate of this argument and it resonates with a lot of people, particularly when they’re feeling the household incomes are stuck, their public services don’t work. So there’s this huge opportunity for Reform.  And let’s remember, the last election, Labour and the Conservatives together got 57 per cent of the vote. That’s the lowest they’ve ever had since the Labour party became a major party in this country. Lowest combined vote. So disaffection is there. I mean, the question of whether Reform is being hyped, in the end, I think comes down to whether you believe that Labour can recover, whether Labour over the course of four years — and it is still a long time — can get the economy moving in the right direction, improve public services and persuade people that normal politics does work for them. And that’s the whole ball game. If they can’t, then I think you’re looking at a Reform or Conservative-like Reform government. Yeah. Lucy Fisher
And Robert, I loved your column this week in which you made the argument that Labour won as a party for change, but it’s failing to sort of harness that insurgent energy in the way it’s governing. And I quote, you say, somehow we’ve reached a place where Labour is seen as the party of the status quo and it’s the right that represents change. Robert Shrimsley Yeah, I mean, to be fair, that wasn’t me saying that. It was an ally of Morgan McSweeney. But I did use that quote and I think it’s a really powerful point that they sit there looking at how we can be the change that stops our voters, the underprivileged voters, the underpaid voters, the people who aren’t graduates, the people who voted for Brexit, basically — how can we get them back? They voted for change. We have to look like we are a change.  And the thing is, in some sense it’s unfair. It’s early in the government. They are doing some quite big transformational things on planning reform and infrastructure, on clean energy. Those are the areas where they’ve been really sluggish and where is this health reform (inaudible) for it. If infrastructure and planning is the big thing, why hasn’t this legislation come through yet?  And I think that lack of urgency, but also partly it’s just Keir Starmer’s demeanour. He doesn’t look hungry and angry. He doesn’t have the flair that Donald Trump has for moves that show whose side you’re on. So in this month, Rachel Reeves has called in regulators, given them a carpeting for standing in the way of growth, got rid of the head of the Competition and Markets Authority. And it’s been quite a quiet, British, very decorous way. You could just imagine how that would be done in Trump land.  And the thing is, whether you approve of Trump or not, what he has acquired is a mastery of the medium and the political messaging. And Labour simply hasn’t captured that. Lucy Fisher George, Kemi Badenoch’s clearly rattled. It seems perhaps no coincidence that this week, the week of this big poll, she decided to unveil her first major policy as leader of the Tories around immigration, very much a Reform-facing area.  George Parker
Yes, I mean, it feels a little bit like panic, doesn’t it? I thought Kemi Badenoch wasn’t going to announce any new policies. We’re sort of meant to be in a period of listening and rebuilding trust and policies could wait. And the fact she’s been forced to wheel out a policy, a rather sort of backward envelope, it seemed to me, about how long you have to be in the country before you can qualify for a British passport. Playing straight . . . I mean, you speak to people in Kemi Badenoch’s team and they say they can’t clear the ground for Farage. They have to take Farage on the question of immigration and they can’t leave the ground clear for him. They’ve got to acknowledge the mistakes they made in government. I personally think this is a big strategic mistake by the Conservative party. They’ve got an appalling record to defend. You can’t out-Farage Farage on this question, and Farage will always say, well, look, when you were in office, 900,000 people came in a single year. Why should anyone believe a word you say on the subject?  And to keep flagging up as your number one priority, initially where you’re probably at your weakest and playing into the hands of your number one political opponent, it just seems to me, you know, I’ve heard . . . (overlapping speech) Gideon Rachman
(Overlapping speech) alternative, George. Do they have to then turn around and say, well, actually, we think immigration’s a good thing? George Parker
I see what the alternative is. They could do what Kemi Badenoch did at prime minister’s question on the week before and talk about academy schools and the fact that the Labour government seems to be reversing some of the reforms that middle-class, traditional Tory voters think are important for their kids. Gideon Rachman
To change the subject. George Parker
To change the subject. I mean, I think they’re playing with fire and it’s taking them down really dangerous roads. And we’ve talked about the quisling comments by Robert Jenrick. It’s almost a bidding war in the Conservative party to be more and more rightwing. And all the time that’s happening, and we’ll see this in the local elections, you drive even more people, sort of traditional Tory supporters in the shires where they’re having these elections on May the 1st, straight into the hands of the Liberal Democrats. Lucy Fisher
Gideon, some people think the UK has had its populist moment already with Brexit, and that’s in the past. You’re shaking your head already. Others point out, you know, the global trend for rightwing populist parties being on the march. Tell us a bit about what’s going on across the rest of the world — the AfD in Germany . . .  Gideon Rachman
Yeah. No, I’d love to believe that, you know, because I grew up with a kind of sentimental view of Britain as this moderate country that wouldn’t . . . would never, you know, we didn’t succumb to fascism, etc. My faith in the inherent moderation of the British was slightly shaken by the whole Brexit period when people became very angry with each other in a way that seemed a bit foreign to us. And then, as you say, looking at the rest of the world, I think it’s very complacent to think that we can’t be affected by this. It just we may be out of phase with it. I think that is the case. For the moment, Britain looks like an island of, can I say, sanity. We have a boring, possibly not terribly competent government, but a centrist government with a big majority. And that’s not what’s happening in the rest of the world. But if they fail, you can see that the Front National or the Rassemblement National, as they’re now called, they could win the next French presidential election.  The AfD will find out next month how strong they are, but they’re gaining in Germany. The far right have just gone into government in Austria, they’re in government in Hungary, they’re in government in Slovakia. They’re in government, I would argue, in the United States. So very complacent if anyone were to say it couldn’t happen here.  And I had a rather chilling conversation with (inaudible). Just a friend who’s a labour activist in Suffolk, you know, I bumped into and he said to me, I can feel the Labour vote just moving to Reform in the east of England. And he said, rather gloomily, I think we may have seen the last, that this might be the last ever Labour government. And I said, OK, maybe that’s a bit extreme. But he made a quite interesting parallel to me, which he said Keir Starmer could be Britain’s François Hollande, as in somebody who wins quite big and you think, oh, the socialists are back. And then by the end of his term, his party’s in ruins. Robert Shrimsley
Well, happy new year. (Laughter) George Parker
We’ve got one every week. Bloody hell. [MUSIC PLAYING] Lucy Fisher
We’ve just got time left for Political Fix stock picks. Robert, who are you buying or selling? Robert Shrimsley
OK, just before I tell you who I am buying or selling, I have to remind who I have dallied with. I gave very serious thought to selling John Swinney, the Scottish First Minister. (Laughter) Lucy Fisher
But remind him. Robert Shrimsley
Of course, I’ve heard the most hilarious story with a . . . A report came out, a sort of governmental report or semi-government report saying that cats should be banned in some areas because of the damage it had to do on wildlife. It wasn’t government policy of the Scottish Government. He said it wasn’t, but he’s had to spend the whole week running around denying that Scotland is about to ban cats. Lucy Fisher
And then there was some suggestion it wasn’t banning cats, but it was . . . It would be forcing citizens to keep them on leads. (Laughter) Robert Shrimsley
It was a disaster and it’s obviously not gonna happen. But one of those funny things where he can’t escape it. But who I’m actually going to sell is Richard Hermer, the attorney-general, because I think he has become far too visible for the good of the government and he’s a close friend of Keir Starmer. He was hunted unexpectedly to become attorney-general. And he’s a really strong human rights international lawyer who clearly accords and aligns with what Starmer believes. So it’s not that I think he’s immediately about to be sacked, but I think he’s become too visible. And I always thought this would happen. He’d become a danger point for the government. I don’t know when it’s gonna happen, but I do think it will. Lucy Fisher
George, how about you? George Parker
This is gonna be slightly unexpected, I think, but I’m gonna go for Angela Rayner. Lucy Fisher
Oh, I was gonna buy her too. Are you . . . Oh, sorry, are you buying or selling her? George Parker
I’m buying her. Lucy Fisher
OK, yeah. George Parker I’m buying Angela Rayner. I’ll tell you why. This is gonna sound very boring and technical, but she’s getting rid of an entire tier of local government. This should have happened 30 or 40 years ago. If you speak to Michael Heseltine, it’s one of his big regrets that he didn’t get rid of all these stupid district councils.  You know, we’ve got far too much local government. There’s kind of your county councils, district councils, parish councils. She’s sweeping it away. She’s continuing and accelerating the drive started under the previous Conservative government of having elected mayors as well. I think that’s what people want. They want strong local figures running streamlined local councils. It’s a bit boring, but I’m buying Angela Rayner. Robert Shrimsley
You wait, they’ll come back. Twenty years, they’ll bring them all back. Lucy Fisher
(Laughter) Well, I was gonna buy her as well, George, because I agree with you. And to sort of bounce off a point that you made earlier, Robert, about how sluggish Labour have been in many areas, in planning they are going fast to change things and I’m not convinced necessarily they’re gonna meet their very ambitious housing target. But I think she has gripped quite a difficult department and I know she’s got a big battle coming up on whether to water down this huge package of workers’ rights that, guess what, business hate. And I think she’s not to be underestimated in a political skirmish. Robert Shrimsley
I actually think she goes to the point we were discussing earlier about someone who can speak to voters and cut through with them. Now she’s a bit Marmite. Some people don’t like her, but as an authentic voice of ordinary people, she has that strength that Keir Starmer doesn’t have. Lucy Fisher
Gideon, how about you? Gideon Rachman
Well, you guys are the experts, so I’ll make a very obvious choice. I would sell Kemi Badenoch. I think that for all the reasons we discussed, she’s in trouble, and I don’t really see her turning it around, particularly since this is the Conservative party that doesn’t give people time and tends to panic. [MUSIC PLAYING] Lucy Fisher
Well, that’s all we’ve got time for this week. George Parker, Robert Shrimsley, Gideon Rachman, thanks for joining. George Parker
Thank you. Robert Shrimsley
Cheers, Lucy. Gideon Rachman

[MUSIC PLAYING]",2025-02-07,This is an audio transcript of the Political Fix podcast episode,"In this episode of the Financial Times Political Fix podcast, the discussion revolves around the implications of Donald Trump's return to the Oval Office (labeled as Trump 2.0) for the UK, and the rising support for the Reform UK party, which is currently leading in national opinion polls over Labour and the Conservatives for the first time.

Gideon Rachman emphasizes that Trump's approach seems more aggressive and imperialistic than expected, making surprising foreign policy claims, such as wanting to acquire territories like Greenland, suggesting Canada as the 51st state, and proposing to annex Gaza. The panel discusses Trump’s seemingly favorable view of Britain which could be attributed to economic factors and personal charm, although they caution that this may change depending on political circumstances.

Labour leader Keir Starmer’s cautious strategy of avoiding direct confrontation with Trump is noted, with commentators suggesting it is a pragmatic approach to protect UK interests, especially regarding potential tariffs that could impact the economy.

The conversation also highlights how Trump's unpredictable nature complicates predictions about UK-U.S. relations and emphasizes the need for the UK government to consider worst-case scenarios as British foreign policy has been closely entwined with the U.S.

On the topic of Reform UK, the panel discusses its rise amid dissatisfaction with the traditional two-party system. Although Reform has gained momentum, there is skepticism regarding its ability to convert polling success into electoral wins, as historical trends show third parties tend to underperform in actual elections.

To sum up, the podcast explores the potential for shifts in UK politics influenced by Trump's presidency,, the strategic responses of UK politicians, and the challenges and opportunities presented by the emergence of Reform UK as a significant political force."

Gideon Rachman
Hello and welcome to the Rachman Review. I’m Gideon Rachman, chief foreign affairs commentator of the Financial Times. This week’s podcast comes from Kyiv in Ukraine. My guests are a wife-and-husband team — Lesia Vasylenko is a member of the Ukrainian parliament and Oleksandr Khomiak is director of Drone Space Labs.

Drone warfare has been crucial to Ukraine’s ability to resist Russia. But if America cuts off military aid, can Ukraine still fight on? 

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Ursula von der Leyen voice clip
A free and sovereign Ukraine is not only in the European interest, but it is in the interest of the whole world, because the autocrats around the world are watching very carefully whether there’s any impunity, if you violate international borders or invade your neighbour or if there is true deterrence. This is not only paramount for Europe. It is also important for Asia, for Africa and for both sides of the Atlantic. An investment in Ukraine’s sovereignty is an investment in the prevention of future wars. 

Gideon Rachman
That was Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, speaking in Kyiv this week at a meeting with President Zelenskyy and a host of other world leaders who were in town to show solidarity with Ukraine. I was in the room watching that meeting unfold. One of the things that struck me, though, was who wasn’t there. There was not a single representative of the United States government. Later that day came a much bigger shock at the United Nations as the US voted on the same side as Russia and North Korea on a UN resolution on Ukraine.

The following day, I met Lesia Vasylenko and Oleksandr Khomiak for breakfast in a Kyiv café. Please forgive the occasional sound of coffee machines in the background. The interview is in two parts. In the first half, I talked to Lesia about the political, diplomatic and military challenges facing Ukraine. And then I turned to Oleksandr to talk about how the war’s evolved and why Ukraine’s mastery of drone warfare gives him hope. But I began with Lesia Vasylenko and asked her about the mood in Ukraine as the war enters its fourth year. 

Lesia Vasylenko
We are living in war, and as far as the mood goes, we have gotten used to living in the war, which is very sad because I think if you ask any average Ukrainian outside in the street, they’ll tell you that we don’t know any more what it’s like to live in a peacetime condition where you can have a bland life, and where you can even plan as far as the next week or the next month. 

Gideon Rachman
Yeah. And we’re very preoccupied in the UK by the change in American attitudes. How concerning is that for you guys? 

Lesia Vasylenko
It’s concerning and frustrating, but it’s also something that we cannot do much about. There is President Trump, who has been elected as the US president, and he has his mind set on bringing peace to Ukraine through negotiations with Putin. To be fair, every single world leader had a go at talking to Putin, even President Zelenskyy when he was elected in 2019. He tried to reason with Putin, believing that he would deliver the peace to Ukraine. Those talks failed. So did talks that President Macron, the French president, was trying to have with Putin. That also failed. And basically that goes for every single leader.

Now we can be hopeful about President Trump having a different attitude and using all his rhetoric, which is sometimes, well, let’s put it mildly, very much impolite towards the Ukrainians, that maybe this is just the method he uses to get in the door and to sit down with Putin, to have a direct conversation. But where is that conversation going to lead if one party — that is Russia — is completely unwilling to settle and to let Ukraine go as an independent country and accept Ukraine as a sovereign, independent state?

Gideon Rachman
So do you think even if there’s a ceasefire agreed, that Putin is likely to violate it and go back to war at some point? Or do you think there’s a possibility you would get a lasting ceasefire? 

Lesia Vasylenko
It would be great to get a lasting ceasefire, but unfortunately, through practice, we have zero reason to believe that a ceasefire would last. In 2014 and then in February 2015, we signed the so-called Minsk agreements. Those so-called documents was about the ceasefire. Russia hasn’t respected a single day of the ceasefire. So imagine we have had no 24-hour window of no shooting on the frontline. Russians would always break that ceasefire or would create provocations and say that the Ukrainians were breaking the ceasefire. So, you know, why would things change now, 2025, why would Russia be suddenly respecting any ceasefire? 

Gideon Rachman
So I guess the danger for Ukraine is that Putin nominally agrees to a ceasefire, Trump says war is over, keeps and then breaks the ceasefire, and Trump in his way, blames the Ukrainians and says, well, I’m not going to come in anyway, you know. 

Lesia Vasylenko
That is one scenario. Another scenario, which is also . . . applies to Russia and their vision of the resolution of the situation, is that there’s a ceasefire called. Fair enough. They respect it for as long as is needed for Ukraine to lift the martial law, to call on elections into which Russia would, of course, meddle in to positioning their technical candidates, placing political parties that would be backed by Russia and run in Ukraine. And essentially the result of the elections will either be a Russian candidate winning. This is the best-case scenario for Russia. That would lead us to the signing of a peace agreement with Russia, which would essentially hand over all of Ukraine to Russia.

Or second scenario, the Russian candidate doesn’t win. Ukrainian candidate wins, which means that Russia will not sign a peace agreement and will simply restart the war, but restart the war in much, much stronger positions because they would have had the time to regroup, to rearm, possibly in that period, since martial law would be lifted. And there’s a good progression towards peace, sanctions would start to be lifted as well, so Russia would be in a much stronger position to attack and a much fiercer and stronger way and possibly attack not just Ukraine, but other countries as well. 

Gideon Rachman
Yeah. And you mentioned this whole question of lifting of martial law and elections and obviously Trump, his infamous remark that Zelenskyy is a dictator was based around the idea that he wasn’t having elections. As I understand it, you’re not in Zelenskyy’s party. 

Lesia Vasylenko
No, I’m not. I’m an opposition MP. I’m from the Holos party. 

Gideon Rachman
But what do you think of the demand for elections now then? 

Lesia Vasylenko
We are in martial law and every single Ukrainian understands that holding elections now would be insane. It’s prohibited by our constitution, the same as it’s prohibited by constitutions of most countries in the world. When it’s martial law, you cannot hold elections. Why not? Because the soldiers who are defending you in the trenches, they will not be able to come out of the trenches and vote. Because when you have territories of Ukraine that are under Russian occupation, you cannot organise elections there. There’s 7mn Ukrainians abroad. How do you get them to vote? Do you organise voting stations in their respective countries? But who is going to pay for that? Who is going to guarantee their security? Who is going to guarantee that the elections there are held according to Ukrainian laws? Those questions have no answers. And this is exactly why Ukraine, just like many countries across the globe, have a prohibition to holding elections during martial law. We have an understanding of that.

But when President Trump calls President Zelenskyy a dictator because he doesn’t want to hold elections at wartime, there’s another question to ask President Trump. How many elections did Ukraine have in the last 20 years as opposed to Russia? The answer is simple. Ukraine had five cycles of elections in the last 20 years. We have re-elected our parliament five times. We have elected our president five times. And we have had many more elections at local government level. In Russia, who is the one guy who runs the country for 20 years? I think the answer is Vladimir Putin. So who is the dictator? 

Gideon Rachman
Indeed. I’ll come to you, Oleksandr, in a second, because I’d be very interested in the situation in the war. But Lesia, before I let you off, I think you might have to go back to Parliament. If, worst case, American military aid stops, do you think Ukraine can fight on? 

Lesia Vasylenko
Yes. We are in a much better position now than we were in February 2022, three years ago. Three years ago, our international partners were placing bets as to how many days or hours Ukraine can hold against Russia. And we held. We held because of our willingness to live and to exist as an independent country. Ukraine hasn’t been fighting a war against Russia for three years, 11 years. Ukraine has been fighting for hundreds of years against Russia and its imperialistic goals. So we have it in our DNA. We know how to you fight those guys. We know how to make sure that we exist as an independent country next to a very aggressive and expansionist neighbour. 

Gideon Rachman
Oleksandr, you were saying to me that the nature of the war has changed very fundamentally because of the kinds of things you’re doing in drone technology and that Ukraine is getting towards self-sufficiency in drones. Can you talk me through that? 

Oleksandr Khomiak
You remember the famous phrase of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the very evening when the war started saying that I don’t need a taxi, I need ammo. And now we produce that ammo and the drones. We need some financial support to continue fighting. But most of the weapons which are the most effective at present at the frontline are made in Ukraine. 

Gideon Rachman
Explain why they’re effective and what the nature of the war is now. 

Oleksandr Khomiak
Well, the nature of the war is basically changed a lot. And if you see again that the Russian assault on the first day, they were moving in large columns and amassing a large amount of troops. Now they are not doing that, and they are only moving in one to five soldiers, trying to penetrate the front line slowly and then amass some number of soldiers in one place, and then maybe use one or two tanks. Why is that? Because presently, if you see a large number of troops moving, they become easy targets for short-range drones, for longer-range drones. And also we have very advanced technology for the reconnaissance now. And we see all those movements. So we can easily predict when Russians try to amass troops in one place that there would be assault and we get prepared for that again with our drones, which stop those tanks and then artillery with support with some other drones which destroy the enemy on march. 

Gideon Rachman
And does that account for the incredible rate of losses of the Russians? I mean, a British army person was telling me that the Russians lost 400,000 people killed or wounded last year and, you know, took 0.5 per cent of the Ukrainian territory for that. 

Oleksandr Khomiak
Yeah, that’s a big part of it and a big part of it that the kill zone now on the frontline is very wide. Because it’s not that the fighting is now around the trench, basically the grey zone now is around 20 to 30km. And if you are on your own in that grey zone, you are likely to be killed or wounded if you are spotted. And you’re very likely to be spotted if it’s day or even night and good weather when drones can operate. 

Gideon Rachman
And how many drones a year is the Ukraine now producing? And give me a sense of how easy it is to produce because you said a lot of these things are 3D printed. 

Oleksandr Khomiak
Yeah, I think Ukraine now produces more than a million drones a year. And in terms of FPV drones, first-person view drones, that number is even higher. And basically, they are very easy to produce because a person who is trained for maybe three to four weeks can already assemble FPV drones. And we have a lot of civic initiatives to teach people to produce drones. And we have some even fantastic initiatives when ordinary people can look at the YouTube videos or have special courses designed by our army and volunteers, assemble the FPV drone and send it to the army to be checked, and then to the frontline. 

Gideon Rachman
And the drones. What are they made of? They are made of cardboard or . . . ? 

Oleksandr Khomiak
Some of them are made of literally of cardboard, especially some drones which are reconnaissance drones or even some long-range drones. Deep strikes are made of the cardboard because it’s harder to spot them if they are made of cardboard, first of all, and then they’re way cheaper than if you use some materials that you would think would be most useful in making drones. So it’s cost efficiency first, but also it is harder to track them if they are made from wood or cardboard. 

Gideon Rachman
And did they change the economics of warfare then? Because these things are comparatively very cheap to produce and yet they can take out a tank. 

Oleksandr Khomiak
Yeah, absolutely. This is the reality of the modern war that you can destroy a tank with a drone worth $500 only. 

Gideon Rachman
And are you confident that you can keep producing those? I mean, from Ukrainian resources? Aren’t you reliant on foreign components?

Oleksandr Khomiak
Well, we are reliant on Chinese components for now, but at this point, we already can produce a 100 per cent Ukrainian drone. That is already a reality. Of course, it would be more difficult to produce that on scale, but again, that is changing. Two years ago we wouldn’t be able to do that and now we already can produce a 100 per cent Ukrainian drone. So now with European efforts also to help us, we can do maybe 100 per cent drone made in Europe. And there are great initiatives which are led, for example, by the UK government, Drone Capability Coalition, which helps Ukraine to build capacity in terms of drones, but which also helps the western governments to produce the drones which are effective in Ukraine. 

Gideon Rachman
And how fascinating, you said Chinese components. Do the Chinese sell you the components? I thought they were on the Russian side?

Oleksandr Khomiak
Well, we hope that they adjust on the business side and they like money more than politics. On paper, they do not sell components directly to Ukraine, and it is impossible to ship components directly from China to Ukraine. But, well, there are still ways and . . . 

Gideon Rachman
They sell to a third country and then it comes to Ukraine. And explain to people. So these drones are made, but are they operated very near the front line, or could you be sitting hundreds of miles away? 

Oleksandr Khomiak
Well, you can literally be sitting in London and operate a drone, which flies on the front line. The technology has developed so quickly and so greatly that an operator can sit in a protected bunker in Kyiv, in Kharkiv, in London and operate the drones, which is prepared on the front line and you just put on your goggles, you take your joystick and you fly it and hit the target. 

Gideon Rachman
So it’s like a computer game, but deadly. 

Oleksandr Khomiak
Absolutely deadly computer game. Yeah. 

Gideon Rachman
But presumably, the Russians can do this as well. Are they good at it as well? 

Oleksandr Khomiak
Well, this is a cat-and-mouse game. We advance in some technologies. Russians are advancing in countering these technologies. We do better, they try to counter us. And this is actually a part of the process which made us so good in this military technology. But we have to acknowledge that Russians are also developing that, and they are also good at that. 

Gideon Rachman
And the other concern is that people have said, well, Elon Musk provides Starlink, which provides the internet, which allows you to operate these drones. If Starlink goes, are you still able to fight in this way? 

Oleksandr Khomiak
Well, if Starlink goes, that would be very unfortunate. And it will require some resources to be reallocated and some technologies to be replaced. But at this point, again, our technology is quite advanced to have the alternatives for Starlink. And we can find these alternatives with help of our European partners and also in developing our own technologies to replace Starlink. So of course, we really much like Starlink, and we are thankful for the US government and Elon Musk for providing that. We hope he doesn’t switch off Starlink for us, but yes, we will be capable of fighting the war without Starlink as effectively as we do with Starlink. It will just take some time to readjust. 

Gideon Rachman
And your worst-case scenario, at least in my head, is that OK, America cuts off the military and Russia does keep fighting, and eventually Russia achieves its aim than it had at the beginning of the war three years ago and you do have Russian tanks in Kyiv. But you don’t think that’s going to happen, do you?

Oleksandr Khomiak
I think realistically now, the worst-case scenario for the next five years is Russia is close to Kharkiv, Russia is very close to the region, Russia is close to Dnipro. 

Gideon Rachman
And these are hundreds and hundreds of miles from Kyiv. 

Oleksandr Khomiak
Yeah, this is hundreds of miles from Kyiv. And for Russia to have the assault, same as they had in February 2022, it will inflict very high casualties on the Russian army. 

Gideon Rachman
Because of this drone war?

Oleksandr Khomiak
Because of the drone warfare, because how the technology has progressed on the battlefield. So we will see them trying to amass large amounts of troops, you know, in Belarus, in Russia, close to the border. And we will strike them with our deep strike drones, with our mid-range drones, drones which are Ukrainian-designed drones and which are mostly produced with Ukrainian-made components. So trying to repeat that assault will result in very high casualties for the Russian army. And I think at this point, they are not capable of sustaining that level of casualties once more. 

Gideon Rachman
You are a lawyer, yeah? And you’ve had to learn all this stuff through the course of the war. 

Oleksandr Khomiak
Yeah, I’m a lawyer, but I had to learn an engineering profession — how to become engineer, how to do drones — because of the war. I never thought this will be my reality. But at this time, engineering profession can help the war effort way more than the legal one. We see the international law doesn’t really work, but international engineering is really effective. 

Gideon Rachman
OK. Do you think we’re seeing the future of warfare here in Ukraine? And are you finding interest from all over the world as militaries try to figure out, if they have to fight, maybe all their old technologies, the things we’ve thought about, you know, tanks, aircraft carriers are no longer so relevant.

Oleksandr Khomiak
Yeah, absolutely. I really hope that our partners in Europe and then in the west are really learning their lesson here and see how vulnerable any big thing on the front line can be or in sea. Those big tanks, big planes, large carriers, large ships, they’re all very big targets. There was a very big Russian Black Sea Fleet. There is no more Black Sea Fleet. And I hope that the western governments see that and learn how to adapt. And we are very happy to share the knowledge.

But I also hope that it’s not just the government but also the societies see that and people understand that it’s not some politicians which have to learn the lesson, but the ordinary people and businesses. And, you know, the tech industry is also looking at this and having their lessons, seeing that technology can help. And we are basically living at the beginning of the new age where all the world that we used to know for the last 30 years is slowly falling apart. 

Gideon Rachman
Yeah. So one of the debates we’re having in the UK and right across Europe is can we afford to spend all this extra money on defence? But the defence world that you’re describing doesn’t really require as much money as some of the old technologies. The drone thing is not that expensive. 

Oleksandr Khomiak
Yeah, it has to be smart money and money well and wisely spent to learn the lessons and to adapt. And I think Ukrainians can help a big deal in that, because we have the experience and we can bring that experience to the UK, to our partners in Europe and even to the US, and to show how the economy of war has changed and how with the very wise investment into technology you can advance your army to a whole new level.

That was Oleksandr Khomiak of Drone Space Labs ending this edition of the Rachman Review. You also heard from Lesia Vasylenko. Thanks for listening. And please join me again next week. ",FEB 26 2025,Transcript,Transcript: Ukraine weathers new geopolitical climate,"Gideon Rachman talks to Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko and Oleksandr Khomiak, director of Drone Space Labs",Gideon Rachman,Print this page,(opens in new window),"Gideon Rachman
Hello and welcome to the Rachman Review. I’m Gideon Rachman, chief foreign affairs commentator of the Financial Times. This week’s podcast comes from Kyiv in Ukraine. My guests are a wife-and-husband team — Lesia Vasylenko is a member of the Ukrainian parliament and Oleksandr Khomiak is director of Drone Space Labs. Drone warfare has been crucial to Ukraine’s ability to resist Russia. But if America cuts off military aid, can Ukraine still fight on?  [MUSIC PLAYING] Ursula von der Leyen voice clip
A free and sovereign Ukraine is not only in the European interest, but it is in the interest of the whole world, because the autocrats around the world are watching very carefully whether there’s any impunity, if you violate international borders or invade your neighbour or if there is true deterrence. This is not only paramount for Europe. It is also important for Asia, for Africa and for both sides of the Atlantic. An investment in Ukraine’s sovereignty is an investment in the prevention of future wars.  Gideon Rachman
That was Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, speaking in Kyiv this week at a meeting with President Zelenskyy and a host of other world leaders who were in town to show solidarity with Ukraine. I was in the room watching that meeting unfold. One of the things that struck me, though, was who wasn’t there. There was not a single representative of the United States government. Later that day came a much bigger shock at the United Nations as the US voted on the same side as Russia and North Korea on a UN resolution on Ukraine. The following day, I met Lesia Vasylenko and Oleksandr Khomiak for breakfast in a Kyiv café. Please forgive the occasional sound of coffee machines in the background. The interview is in two parts. In the first half, I talked to Lesia about the political, diplomatic and military challenges facing Ukraine. And then I turned to Oleksandr to talk about how the war’s evolved and why Ukraine’s mastery of drone warfare gives him hope. But I began with Lesia Vasylenko and asked her about the mood in Ukraine as the war enters its fourth year.  Lesia Vasylenko
We are living in war, and as far as the mood goes, we have gotten used to living in the war, which is very sad because I think if you ask any average Ukrainian outside in the street, they’ll tell you that we don’t know any more what it’s like to live in a peacetime condition where you can have a bland life, and where you can even plan as far as the next week or the next month.  Gideon Rachman
Yeah. And we’re very preoccupied in the UK by the change in American attitudes. How concerning is that for you guys?  Lesia Vasylenko
It’s concerning and frustrating, but it’s also something that we cannot do much about. There is President Trump, who has been elected as the US president, and he has his mind set on bringing peace to Ukraine through negotiations with Putin. To be fair, every single world leader had a go at talking to Putin, even President Zelenskyy when he was elected in 2019. He tried to reason with Putin, believing that he would deliver the peace to Ukraine. Those talks failed. So did talks that President Macron, the French president, was trying to have with Putin. That also failed. And basically that goes for every single leader. Now we can be hopeful about President Trump having a different attitude and using all his rhetoric, which is sometimes, well, let’s put it mildly, very much impolite towards the Ukrainians, that maybe this is just the method he uses to get in the door and to sit down with Putin, to have a direct conversation. But where is that conversation going to lead if one party — that is Russia — is completely unwilling to settle and to let Ukraine go as an independent country and accept Ukraine as a sovereign, independent state? Gideon Rachman
So do you think even if there’s a ceasefire agreed, that Putin is likely to violate it and go back to war at some point? Or do you think there’s a possibility you would get a lasting ceasefire?  Lesia Vasylenko
It would be great to get a lasting ceasefire, but unfortunately, through practice, we have zero reason to believe that a ceasefire would last. In 2014 and then in February 2015, we signed the so-called Minsk agreements. Those so-called documents was about the ceasefire. Russia hasn’t respected a single day of the ceasefire. So imagine we have had no 24-hour window of no shooting on the frontline. Russians would always break that ceasefire or would create provocations and say that the Ukrainians were breaking the ceasefire. So, you know, why would things change now, 2025, why would Russia be suddenly respecting any ceasefire?  Gideon Rachman
So I guess the danger for Ukraine is that Putin nominally agrees to a ceasefire, Trump says war is over, keeps and then breaks the ceasefire, and Trump in his way, blames the Ukrainians and says, well, I’m not going to come in anyway, you know.  Lesia Vasylenko
That is one scenario. Another scenario, which is also . . . applies to Russia and their vision of the resolution of the situation, is that there’s a ceasefire called. Fair enough. They respect it for as long as is needed for Ukraine to lift the martial law, to call on elections into which Russia would, of course, meddle in to positioning their technical candidates, placing political parties that would be backed by Russia and run in Ukraine. And essentially the result of the elections will either be a Russian candidate winning. This is the best-case scenario for Russia. That would lead us to the signing of a peace agreement with Russia, which would essentially hand over all of Ukraine to Russia. Or second scenario, the Russian candidate doesn’t win. Ukrainian candidate wins, which means that Russia will not sign a peace agreement and will simply restart the war, but restart the war in much, much stronger positions because they would have had the time to regroup, to rearm, possibly in that period, since martial law would be lifted. And there’s a good progression towards peace, sanctions would start to be lifted as well, so Russia would be in a much stronger position to attack and a much fiercer and stronger way and possibly attack not just Ukraine, but other countries as well.  Gideon Rachman
Yeah. And you mentioned this whole question of lifting of martial law and elections and obviously Trump, his infamous remark that Zelenskyy is a dictator was based around the idea that he wasn’t having elections. As I understand it, you’re not in Zelenskyy’s party.  Lesia Vasylenko
No, I’m not. I’m an opposition MP. I’m from the Holos party.  Gideon Rachman
But what do you think of the demand for elections now then?  Lesia Vasylenko
We are in martial law and every single Ukrainian understands that holding elections now would be insane. It’s prohibited by our constitution, the same as it’s prohibited by constitutions of most countries in the world. When it’s martial law, you cannot hold elections. Why not? Because the soldiers who are defending you in the trenches, they will not be able to come out of the trenches and vote. Because when you have territories of Ukraine that are under Russian occupation, you cannot organise elections there. There’s 7mn Ukrainians abroad. How do you get them to vote? Do you organise voting stations in their respective countries? But who is going to pay for that? Who is going to guarantee their security? Who is going to guarantee that the elections there are held according to Ukrainian laws? Those questions have no answers. And this is exactly why Ukraine, just like many countries across the globe, have a prohibition to holding elections during martial law. We have an understanding of that. But when President Trump calls President Zelenskyy a dictator because he doesn’t want to hold elections at wartime, there’s another question to ask President Trump. How many elections did Ukraine have in the last 20 years as opposed to Russia? The answer is simple. Ukraine had five cycles of elections in the last 20 years. We have re-elected our parliament five times. We have elected our president five times. And we have had many more elections at local government level. In Russia, who is the one guy who runs the country for 20 years? I think the answer is Vladimir Putin. So who is the dictator?  Gideon Rachman
Indeed. I’ll come to you, Oleksandr, in a second, because I’d be very interested in the situation in the war. But Lesia, before I let you off, I think you might have to go back to Parliament. If, worst case, American military aid stops, do you think Ukraine can fight on?  Lesia Vasylenko
Yes. We are in a much better position now than we were in February 2022, three years ago. Three years ago, our international partners were placing bets as to how many days or hours Ukraine can hold against Russia. And we held. We held because of our willingness to live and to exist as an independent country. Ukraine hasn’t been fighting a war against Russia for three years, 11 years. Ukraine has been fighting for hundreds of years against Russia and its imperialistic goals. So we have it in our DNA. We know how to you fight those guys. We know how to make sure that we exist as an independent country next to a very aggressive and expansionist neighbour.  Gideon Rachman
Oleksandr, you were saying to me that the nature of the war has changed very fundamentally because of the kinds of things you’re doing in drone technology and that Ukraine is getting towards self-sufficiency in drones. Can you talk me through that?  Oleksandr Khomiak
You remember the famous phrase of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the very evening when the war started saying that I don’t need a taxi, I need ammo. And now we produce that ammo and the drones. We need some financial support to continue fighting. But most of the weapons which are the most effective at present at the frontline are made in Ukraine.  Gideon Rachman
Explain why they’re effective and what the nature of the war is now.  Oleksandr Khomiak
Well, the nature of the war is basically changed a lot. And if you see again that the Russian assault on the first day, they were moving in large columns and amassing a large amount of troops. Now they are not doing that, and they are only moving in one to five soldiers, trying to penetrate the front line slowly and then amass some number of soldiers in one place, and then maybe use one or two tanks. Why is that? Because presently, if you see a large number of troops moving, they become easy targets for short-range drones, for longer-range drones. And also we have very advanced technology for the reconnaissance now. And we see all those movements. So we can easily predict when Russians try to amass troops in one place that there would be assault and we get prepared for that again with our drones, which stop those tanks and then artillery with support with some other drones which destroy the enemy on march.  Gideon Rachman
And does that account for the incredible rate of losses of the Russians? I mean, a British army person was telling me that the Russians lost 400,000 people killed or wounded last year and, you know, took 0.5 per cent of the Ukrainian territory for that.  Oleksandr Khomiak
Yeah, that’s a big part of it and a big part of it that the kill zone now on the frontline is very wide. Because it’s not that the fighting is now around the trench, basically the grey zone now is around 20 to 30km. And if you are on your own in that grey zone, you are likely to be killed or wounded if you are spotted. And you’re very likely to be spotted if it’s day or even night and good weather when drones can operate.  Gideon Rachman
And how many drones a year is the Ukraine now producing? And give me a sense of how easy it is to produce because you said a lot of these things are 3D printed.  Oleksandr Khomiak
Yeah, I think Ukraine now produces more than a million drones a year. And in terms of FPV drones, first-person view drones, that number is even higher. And basically, they are very easy to produce because a person who is trained for maybe three to four weeks can already assemble FPV drones. And we have a lot of civic initiatives to teach people to produce drones. And we have some even fantastic initiatives when ordinary people can look at the YouTube videos or have special courses designed by our army and volunteers, assemble the FPV drone and send it to the army to be checked, and then to the frontline.  Gideon Rachman
And the drones. What are they made of? They are made of cardboard or . . . ?  Oleksandr Khomiak
Some of them are made of literally of cardboard, especially some drones which are reconnaissance drones or even some long-range drones. Deep strikes are made of the cardboard because it’s harder to spot them if they are made of cardboard, first of all, and then they’re way cheaper than if you use some materials that you would think would be most useful in making drones. So it’s cost efficiency first, but also it is harder to track them if they are made from wood or cardboard.  Gideon Rachman
And did they change the economics of warfare then? Because these things are comparatively very cheap to produce and yet they can take out a tank.  Oleksandr Khomiak
Yeah, absolutely. This is the reality of the modern war that you can destroy a tank with a drone worth $500 only.  Gideon Rachman
And are you confident that you can keep producing those? I mean, from Ukrainian resources? Aren’t you reliant on foreign components? Oleksandr Khomiak
Well, we are reliant on Chinese components for now, but at this point, we already can produce a 100 per cent Ukrainian drone. That is already a reality. Of course, it would be more difficult to produce that on scale, but again, that is changing. Two years ago we wouldn’t be able to do that and now we already can produce a 100 per cent Ukrainian drone. So now with European efforts also to help us, we can do maybe 100 per cent drone made in Europe.

They sell to a third country and then it comes to Ukraine. And explain to people. So these drones are made, but are they operated very near the front line, or could you be sitting hundreds of miles away?  Oleksandr Khomiak
Well, you can literally be sitting in London and operate a drone, which flies on the front line. The technology has developed so quickly and so greatly that an operator can sit in a protected bunker in Kyiv, in Kharkiv, in London and operate the drones, which is prepared on the front line and you just put on your goggles, you take your joystick and you fly it and hit the target.  Gideon Rachman

Absolutely deadly computer game. Yeah.  Gideon Rachman

That was Oleksandr Khomiak of Drone Space Labs ending this edition of the Rachman Review. You also heard from Lesia Vasylenko. Thanks for listening. And please join me again next week. ",2025-02-26,This is an audio transcript of the Rachman Review podcast episode,"In a recent episode of the Rachman Review podcast, host Gideon Rachman discusses the ongoing war in Ukraine from Kyiv with guests Lesia Vasylenko, a Ukrainian parliament member, and Oleksandr Khomiak, director of Drone Space Labs. The podcast highlights the significance of drone warfare in Ukraine's resistance against Russia and raises concerns about U.S. military aid potentially being cut off.

Vasylenko expresses frustration regarding changing U.S. attitudes towards Ukraine, especially with former President Trump's approach that may favor negotiations with Putin, despite previous failed attempts. She notes that a ceasefire is unlikely to hold due to Russia's history of breaking agreements.

Khomiak discusses Ukraine's advancements in drone technology, explaining how Ukraine has shifted from relying on foreign support to producing over a million drones annually, including simple, cost-effective models made from materials like cardboard. He explains that these drones enable effective surveillance and targeting, changing the dynamics of warfare by allowing operators to engage from significant distances, sometimes even remotely from other countries.

Both guests emphasize the importance of continued support and innovation in military technology, warning that if American aid ceases, Ukraine could still fight on, relying on its robust commitment to independence and developing military technology. They suggest that the war in Ukraine is shaping the future of warfare, advocating for smart investments in new technologies that could be less costly but highly effective."

Gideon Rachman
Hello and welcome to the Rachman Review. I’m Gideon Rachman, chief foreign affairs commentator of the Financial Times. This week’s podcast comes from Berlin. My guest is Mathias Döpfner, the chairman and chief executive of Axel Springer, Germany’s most powerful media group.

National elections take place in Germany this weekend. The far-right Alternative for Deutschland party is expected to surge to a record score in the polls. Germany’s mainstream parties shun the AfD, but the US vice-president JD Vance says that’s the wrong approach. So what future for Germany and for transatlantic relations?

JD Vance voice clip
What no democracy — American, German or European — will survive is telling millions of voters that their thoughts and concerns, their aspirations, their pleas for relief are invalid or unworthy of even being considered. Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters. There’s no room for firewalls. You either uphold the principle or you don’t.

Gideon Rachman
That speech by JD Vance was made in Munich just a week before the German election. His barely coded call for the AfD to be allowed into government caused shockwaves in Germany and in the conference hall of Munich, where I witnessed the reaction of the crowd. It also posed very profound questions for those Germans who are committed to their country’s long-standing alliance with America.

There are few more convinced pro-Americans than Mathias Döpfner. He’s written a book called The Trade Trap, arguing for the creation of a transatlantic free trade area and for the west to curtail trade with China and Russia. He owns the German tabloid Bild and the conservative broadsheet Die Welt. And as the owner of Politico, a major news site, Axel Springer also has big business interests in the US. Döpfner is regarded as a leading conservative voice in Germany. But the Trump administration has started cancelling subscriptions to Politico, accusing it of liberal bias. It’s a reminder that in an era of tariff wars and real wars, it’s impossible to disentangle international relations, domestic politics and business.

To add some business expertise, I enlisted the help of my Berlin-based colleague Laura Pitel, who came with me to the meeting at Axel Springer HQ. You’ll hear from Laura later in the interview, and this episode will be a bit longer than usual.

I began with that JD Vance speech. It’s been widely denounced in Germany. Friedrich Merz, the leader of the Christian Democrats, who the polls suggest will be Germany’s next chancellor, accused Vance of open interference in German domestic politics. So what did Mathias Döpfner think about the reaction to Vance’s speech?

Mathias Döpfner
I have a lot of criticism for the reaction to the Vance speech because I think that is unstrategic and I think it’s even dangerous. We need a transatlantic security alliance and we need a transatlantic trade relationship. And just to react to everything in a kind of bitter way and then calling for a kind of European isolationism, I find that very inappropriate.

And yes, I think there are a lot of points in the Vance speech that I would love to discuss, where I think he has a point. And I also see a lot of things where he was, I think, intentionally misunderstood. People are saying he smashed the door and said that’s the end of the transatlantic relationship. I don’t read it like that.

Gideon Rachman
OK. So what bits did you agree with?

Mathias Döpfner
That we have to discuss what Europe stands for and what needs to be defended. That we have to discuss how we deal with political movements, parties, voters that we fundamentally disagree with. I think the firewall discussion is an appropriate discussion. And if it’s not let in Germany, then I think it is inspiring . . . if a foreign politician is asking the question if it’s smart to simply give to 20 per cent of the voters the message that whatever you do, whatever you vote for, you will not be heard, I think everybody is free to agree on a potential coalition or not.

And I personally think it would be a big mistake to treat the AfD as a normal political movement and to form a coalition with it. But to exclude it right away, I think has made it big. And so this is a valid point and a good discussion that he had. And then also the discussion about free speech, of course, it’s interesting. Of course then you also can have the discussion, to which degree does the American administration live up to that? And then it gets interesting, it gets lively. But to just ignore it and say it’s an interference in German politics, I think that’s really stupid.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah, but it seems to me that it’s quite a fine distinction you’re drawing between saying that it’s wrong to have a firewall to saying the AfD can never join a coalition. But to say but actually, personally, I think that we shouldn’t have a coalition.

Mathias Döpfner
Exactly. I think that is a very important distinction, because after an election, if you won the election to decide this is a partner and this is no partner, that’s one thing. But to exclude it upfront makes it so easy for this movement to simply say we are outcasts and we are not part of the discussion. I mean, they never have to really explain it. We see it in the recent past. Just a few months ago, it was this taboo. We cannot even talk to them. We cannot invite them to a debate or to a talk show. We cannot have interviews with them and so on. What did they do? It made them bigger and bigger and bigger because it’s so easy to always be against everything, never have to really explain, never be challenged. And now suddenly that has changed. And what we see is one occasion after the other, pretty poor arguments, pretty weak defence and I think that is demystifying it. It’s, I think a valuable discussion that we have to have and it is really about the fundaments of democracy.

Gideon Rachman
And you got attacked for running a piece by Elon Musk defending the AfD. But presumably, I mean when Musk says the AfD, like, there’s nothing wrong with them, they’re a perfectly normal party. In fact, both he and Vance, I think, came pretty close to endorsing them. If you have to then explain to Musk, whom you know, why you think actually the AfD are not a normal party, am I characterising your position correctly? What would you say to him in response to that piece?

Mathias Döpfner
Well, I think it’s an interpretation and I cannot speak on his behalf because I’m not living in his brain. But I’m pretty sure that he sees a necessary disruption of very inefficient, dysfunctional political rituals and systems that need reform. And that’s why he is very much in favour of these disruptive movements from Milei in Argentina to Meloni in Italy to Trump in America. And he sees perhaps the AfD in Germany as the next example in that context.

What I think he may underestimate is that the AfD is on many levels uncomparable to these other movements because it is in sharp contrast, for example, to Meloni, literally very pro-Russian. I mean, we just heard a recent interview where the simple fact that Russia has started the war, an aggressive war in Ukraine, was not even mentioned or criticised. So there is a very pro-Russian, pro-Chinese, and I’m speaking not about the people, but about the Communist party. And the geopolitical aggression of Putin is something that is not perceived as a threat or as a negative, but as something that we should accept and that we should have a positive relationship with.

It is a party that has very, to put it mildly, wobbly positioning towards antisemitism in some parts of the party. It’s fair to say that it is in any case very anti-Israel. And you could say to a certain degree it is also very anti-American. Against, for example, American weapons on German ground. So I just think one should see these factors and not put it in comparison to these other disruptive movements that I’ve mentioned.

Gideon Rachman
And what about its relationship to the Nazi past? I mean, you write quite movingly in your book about the impact on your father, your father’s generation. These guys and Musk himself said, you know, Germany’s got to take a more positive attitude to its own history.

Mathias Döpfner
Whenever it’s about the remembrance of the German past, during Nazi times and the Holocaust, you get at least mixed signals. And in the very recent past, there was a Holocaust survivor speaking in the German parliament, and large parts of the AfD did not applaud. Some people even left on other occasions the room. I mean, those are gestures and we should take that seriously.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah. And it seems to me that flowing from that, Germany has a particular place in this free speech debate because of the Nazi period, you got quite strict rules on what you can say and you are what maybe Musk would call a free speech fundamentalist in certain contexts. But is it still right for Germany to have a slightly different view?

Mathias Döpfner
Absolutely, yes. I’m really a free speech evangelist, but I think the German history is reason enough to treat that topic differently. And if somebody denies the Holocaust, then that is under German law a crime, and I think rightly so.

Gideon Rachman
Right. And yet you’re saying these guys should still be part of the political scene. And presumably, you also think that they do raise some legitimate issues. I mean, Bild has been strong on migration and so on.

Mathias Döpfner
That’s the whole thing. Just because the wrong person or the wrong party or a personal party that you dislike says something that is right, you do not have to necessarily say the opposite. That’s a very dangerous trap. We spoke about some topics where I think they are fundamentally dangerous, but if it is about migration, the fact that the other German parties have addressed it too late or not decisively enough and not efficiently enough, and things are getting more and more out of control, that is something that we should just accept. And the denial of the migration problem by large parts of the political left is, I think, the most counterproductive thing because it strengthens the radical right and it leads not to less xenophobia, it leads to more xenophobia. It leads not to less racism, but to more racism. And that’s why I think it is of ultimate priority to tackle that topic. And again, just because one party says it, it doesn’t need to be completely wrong.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah. I mean, if the opinion polls are right, the AfD will do well in the next election, you know, unprecedentedly well, but they won’t be in a position to form a government or even necessarily make it into a coalition. In fact, they probably won’t be in the coalition. But some people have said to me, this is the old system’s last chance, that if Merz wins and becomes chancellor, he really has to succeed, because otherwise the next election, the populists, the AfD, might win.

Mathias Döpfner
Nobody really knows the exact outcome of the next election. We all have seen how un-precise the polls are, particularly if it is in the context of more very leftwing or very rightwing movements. But one thing I think is certain is really the last chance of centrist parties in Germany, because if Merz is forced after a potential win of the election to form a coalition, perhaps even with two parties, with the Greens and with the Social Democrats, and if then as a fundament for this coalition agreement, there is a very small common denominator and not enough substantial reform programme and reform action, then I think the AfD will be strengthened further and the likelihood that they would then be the biggest party four years from now is very high. And to avoid that, we need now a very determined and convincing reform agenda and structural reforms on many levels.

Gideon Rachman
You know Merz very well. I assume he’s a slight unknown quantity. Well, I guess he’s been in international business, but outside those circles . . . If you have to describe him to a foreign audience, what’s he like as a person?

Mathias Döpfner
He’s a very serious person. He’s a real transatlanticist. He has business experience. And those are all preconditions for the reform agenda that we are all desperately waiting for. The question is, in which coalition can he do it? And the question is, how much courage does he really have personally to push things through? I mean, this famous Bismarck sentence — politics is the art of the possible — is very often misunderstood. It’s misunderstood in the sense that people think you do what is just possible at the moment because the polls are allowing it and the majority of people think like that. I think the art of the possible is to do what seems to be impossible at that very moment, and that requires courage.

Helmut Kohl has written his plan for reunification without asking the party and without asking anybody. That was leadership. And this leadership more in the spirit of Winston Churchill, that is now desperately needed. We need at least a little Churchillian moment in Germany.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah. OK. So you mentioned Merz’s atlanticism and your own atlanticism. I think one of the reasons that people’s reaction — and I have to admit my reaction to Vance’s speech, I think you probably disagree with what I’ve written, but you believe in free debate — was that they felt it wasn’t just a criticism of European attitudes to free speech. He was in some sense saying we don’t recognise a community of values any more. And combining that with the fact that Trump is unilaterally opening negotiations with Putin over the heads of the Ukrainians, people are saying, gee, you know, the transatlantic alliance is in real trouble.

Mathias Döpfner
The transatlantic alliance is in real trouble. The trouble started in the times of Angela Merkel and Barack Obama and has not improved since then. And if we now do not redefine it, I think Europe and America will be in trouble. If the idea of America First means America Alone, it’s not going to work. It’s not going to work with regard to the big security challenges and geopolitical challenges, and it’s not going to work with regard to economic prosperity and trade.

What has the war on Ukraine and the war on Israel and the potential takeover of Taiwan in common? It’s the attack on democracy. The goal is to weaken the biggest democracy in the world. The goal is to disentangle, to split America and Europe, and with that, weaken democracy in their economies. And nobody can solve that alone. We need an alliance. And if Europe is a difficult partner because too regulated, because too slow, because of many, many aspects, yes, but still, it’s better with Europe than without. And that is also true the other way around. If the American administration is very unconventional with regard to style and communication and some decisions, maybe, but we have to understand it.

And the big European misunderstanding is that we take Trump literally, and that’s wrong. We should take Trump seriously, but we should not take him literally. And if he, for example, in the context of tariffs, is threatening Europe with an announcement of higher tariffs, then this is the invitation to dance, then this is the opening, the start of negotiations, and we do not even react to that. Instead of being kind of bitter and offended, we should now sit together and discuss the situation.

And I think the situation is pretty clear. The US is paying on average 5 per cent tariffs on European goods. Europe is paying 3.3 per cent on average on American goods, so the Americans pay higher tariffs. There is room and need for negotiation. What we have to do is we have to lower the tariffs. We have to lower the tariffs symmetrically. And in return, we have to define a common strategy and an alliance in dealing with China and other non-democratic economies.

If then America and Europe would sit together in China at the negotiation table representing 800mn people, the likelihood that we are going to achieve a good outcome for a more symmetrical, for a fairer trade with China is much higher than if America does it alone, and if Europe tries it alone, it’s impossible. If we do not achieve something like that, the outcome will be really damaging and particularly for Europe.

Gideon Rachman
So you haven’t given up on the theme of your book, The Trade Trap, at all? You still believe that the way to go is a transatlantic trade agreement and actually excluding the autocracies Russia and China.

Mathias Döpfner
I think it is more acute than ever. That’s exactly the big question. I mean, we see and we know that the WTO is dysfunctional. I think it has to cease operations and should be replaced by a trade alliance that is way more minimalistic, more in the spirit of the old guard. But in any case, the fundament and the basis for any successful new trade architecture is the European-American alliance. It is literally inconceivable that we are not managing that because what that would then do, it would definitely strengthen the non-democratic economies. China would then, for certain, become the biggest economy in the world. The dependency of European countries, particularly of Germany from China, would be unlimited. Other autocracies in the Middle East and other players will get stronger. And Russia, we have seen, I mean, Russia is a relatively small economy, but nevertheless a very aggressive 19th-century geopolitics player. I think the combination of threats then is to be taken very seriously.

Gideon Rachman
But, you know, we’re all guessing because Trump is volatile and says something surprising every day. But if I had to guess, I think he wants to lift sanctions on Russia as part of a deal with Russia. If that happens, how serious is that?

Mathias Döpfner
For me, the whole Russia-Ukraine topic is a kind of test case with regard to Trump’s actions. We have seen in the past that we have to clearly distinguish announcements or statements from decisions and actions. I still do not give up the hope that the outcome of peace negotiations will be surprisingly difficult for Putin so that nobody can really call it a dictated peace, which would mean a victory of Russia, which would mean a continuation of the conflict, because a Putin who has achieved his goals will go further.

It’s totally naive to think that Putin is going to stop once he has Ukraine. In the past, we have seen that the kind of situation in Georgia has just encouraged him. Then he went for Crimea. We accepted that. Then he went for large parts of Ukraine. If he achieves that, he will continue. The Baltics will be next, Moldavia in between, and one day, perhaps Poland or Germany. I mean, where is the end? And the cost and the price for the United States will get higher and higher. So I’m convinced that this administration realises that. And perhaps we just have to wait for the outcome of the negotiations. And if it’s convincing, if it’s acceptable, if it’s really a kind of fair deal that also shows to Putin, I did not achieve my goals and I should definitely not try it again, then I think we have to accept that he did it and he did it better than predicted. If it is this dictated peace and Russia wins the war, then I think it is truly a turning point in world history.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah. And at that point, would even a dyed in the wool kind of atlanticist like yourself have to reassess?

Mathias Döpfner
The short answer is yes.

Gideon Rachman
And we may know quite soon, I guess. In your book, you start by saying the rule of law is fundamental to democracy, and it’s what saves us from fear and gives us a basis for prosperity, etc. So what do you think when — I know one shouldn’t react to everything that Trump says. That’s certainly right — but he has just put out this tweet saying, when a leader acts in the interest of saving the country, he cannot be breaking the law. And he’s pinned that. That’s a quote from Napoleon, and Musk has retweeted it with 14 American flags. That sounds like a leader saying I’m above the law.

Mathias Döpfner
Yeah, that is for me exactly the red line that should never be crossed. I think every person, whether it’s a business leader, whether it’s an artist, whether it’s a scientist, and most importantly, if it’s a politician, if such a leader or an influential person thinks that she or he is above the law, this is leading to disaster. The law protects us and sometimes it protects us against ourselves. It protects us against the common sense of the moment. So we should all respect, the more power we have, that the law applies also for ourselves.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah. And you write, again quite interestingly, in the book about your different encounters with world leaders. So I’d just like you to tell the story of the contrast between meeting Putin and meeting Blair.

Mathias Döpfner
Well, yeah. I mean, it really illustrates that, because when I visited Putin in 2005, not only did he let me wait for a couple of hours as a gesture of authority, but also then because I really had to catch a plane in order to get back, he said, no problem, we will give you an escort. And then I went with 15 motorcycles and cars and screaming megaphones to the airport, which was quite an embarrassing experience. But of course, this also was a gesture of power to impress.

And I have many meetings with other autocratic leaders who basically said, well, if there’s a problem, we fix it. They took the mobile phone, made a call and said, we are going to fix it. Whenever I had, let’s say, a real democrat, the gesture is basically, it’s interesting to hear about, I can’t do anything because we have our institutions, we have our law, we have our authorities to deal with. So this attitude “I can fix it” is for me almost an indicator that something goes wrong with the rule of law and with the respect for that.

Gideon Rachman
Yeah. Last question from me before I hand over to Laura. And in a way, it’s kind of segue to it, because as a businessman, if the rule of law really is in question in America and you’re somebody who makes big transatlantic investments, you have to think twice. Don’t you?

Mathias Döpfner
If I look on the transatlantic relationship from a political point of view, I would always say the transatlantic alliance is way stronger than any administration, than any political leader. It should be an overriding goal and value and project. And the same is true on a company level. America is, for us, the biggest market. We are the only real transatlantic publisher. We have incredible growth in America. We believe in the prospects of the American market. If we have to deal with some setbacks, like a few days ago when suddenly Politico was identified as the arch-enemy of this administration because it’s perceived as the leftwing media symbol, then we should react a little bit more relaxed, perhaps.

I mean, for me, it’s almost funny, honestly, to see it after two and a half decades being portrayed in Germany as the centre of the rightwing conspiracy, I’m now portrayed in America as the centre of the leftwing conspiracy. Honestly, that’s exactly the position where an independent publisher should be in, and we believe in America and will continue to invest and grow in America.

Laura Pitel
My questions fall on very neatly from that. The first thing I wanted to ask you about was this bout with Politico, and it’s easy to sort of laugh it off and say it’s kind of comical to have this criticism coming from both sides. But that’s, you know, also, certainly quite a serious threat coming to the media from the Trump administration. And how should big media owners like yourself handle that?

Mathias Döpfner
Well, first of all, I hope that it is a misunderstanding. It can only be a misunderstanding. We did not take, in 18 years of Politico’s existence, a single cent of government subsidy or government funding. What has been portrayed as government subsidy is the subscription that we are selling. So I don’t know if it’s just a misunderstanding or a mix-up between subsidies and subscription. But we are selling Politico Pro subscriptions at a high price like a Bloomberg terminal to people who are working in the sphere of politics and policy. And they need the real-time data and that in-depth analysis of Politico Pro dealing with legislation in order to do their job more efficiently. That’s why they want this product and why they pay a price for that.

To portray that as a subsidy is really an almost funny misunderstanding because if you take that seriously, that would mean that every Boeing aeroplane that the government buys is a subsidy to Boeing. Every Palantir subscription a Secret Service uses is a subsidy to Palantir. Every real estate that you rent in order to have a government office is a subsidy to the real estate firm. This can only be a misunderstanding, and I hope that it will be clarified. And listening to the speech of vice-president Vance, freedom of speech, yes, I’m very much for it. As we have said, I’m a fundamentalist, but I hope that this principle will also be upheld for journalism that you don’t like. 

Laura Pitel
Do you think there’s a grain of truth in some of the Trump administration’s criticism that the media has a sort of inherent leftwing liberal bias? 

Mathias Döpfner
Of course, and that is proven in many polls and analysis of media bias. That’s a fact. But I think you cannot fight a bias with a new bias.

Laura Pitel
You’ve always been a big admirer of American entrepreneurs and tech pundits, people like Mark Zuckerberg, also Jeff Bezos. What do you think about how they have responded to the re-election of Trump? Do you think Jeff Bezos was right to pull out the Kamala Harris endorsement?

Mathias Döpfner
That’s really interesting because I’ve asked myself, is it that they now can say what they always thought? Or is it just opportunism? Honestly, I don’t know. I don’t want to judge. I just say in our case, we have not to move or we have not to shift because we have never described Republican government as the end of civilisation or the end of democracy. But we would now also not try to sit in the first row of the inauguration. In any case, for a publisher, there’s a particular need for a certain degree of unpredictability and being not in one or the other camp.

Laura Pitel
You helped to take the company private along with KKR about five years ago and recently that deal has come to an end. And now you and the widow of the founder of this company, Friede Springer, you’ve achieved what you always wanted to, which was to be the sole private owners after parting ways with KKR. Can you talk a little bit about what you want to do with that newfound freedom and what direction you’re going to take the business in?

Mathias Döpfner
The new structure bears the opportunity for true entrepreneurial decisions. There are no short-term restrictions that are sometimes given by the capital markets and the publicly listed company. The goal is really to do things that will pay off in the midterm and then will make sense entrepreneurially in the long term. And I think that is truly a new freedom and a new opportunity, but also the risk exposure is higher. There is no excuse in the future. It’s only up to us to really make the right moves.

Laura Pitel
There’s been speculation for some time that you’d like to make another acquisition in the US, like The Wall Street Journal is a name that always does the rounds. Is that right? Would you like to buy the Journal?

Mathias Döpfner
This Wall Street Journal thing is really funny because there’s almost no interview in the last two years that I gave where I wasn’t asked about that and always in the spirit we know that The Wall Street Journal is for sale and you are going to buy.

According to my information, The Wall Street Journal is not for sale. And if it would be for sale, I mean, of course, we would most likely look into it. But the likelihood that we would really buy it, that we would get it is close to zero. So I think it’s a highly theoretical topic, and that’s why it is so funny to speculate about it.

Laura Pitel
You would like it. You would like to buy it if you could, let’s just say.

Mathias Döpfner
We have in general said we would not buy newspapers. We are a digital publisher. Our business, with the exception of two assets in Germany, Bild and Welt, which still have a kind of little print element, is a digital portfolio which is structurally growing with double-digit organic top line growth. We would double and triple check to add to this portfolio a print element.

Now there are two super brands in the world that I’m very passionate about. That is the Financial Times, which we tried to buy unsuccessfully once (chuckles) and The Wall Street Journal but I would take a bet. First of all, I don’t think The Wall Street Journal is for sale. Secondly, I think we are not going to buy it.

Laura Pitel
So, not a no, I would say.

Mathias Döpfner
One should never exclude it. We spoke about firewalls at the beginning of our conversation. Why would I erect a firewall? But it’s not happening. (Chuckles)

Laura Pitel
Let’s ask you about the topic of Big Tech, because obviously that’s a big competitor to conventional, established journalism. You know, the likes of X, Instagram, TikTok. These are taking readers away from you in a way, and you said that TikTok should be banned in Europe.

Mathias Döpfner
I said three years ago in America at the Code Conference that in every democracy of self-esteem, TikTok should be banned or sold because under this Chinese ownership, which is in a direct connection to the Communist party with regard to the usage of data and the surveillance aspects that come with it, I think it is a fundamental democracy problem and I’m very excited that now in America this problem is about to be solved through a sale to a different owner. And then TikTok is the smartest product, the algorithm in social media. And that leads to the other part of your question. I think in general, social media, it’s not black and white, it’s not good or bad. Social media is a wonderful enrichment of our media landscape. And also journalists and media brands like ours benefit from social media, but it comes also with certain side effects or developments that can be dangerous for society.

For example, the principle that a publisher has to take the responsibility for everything that is published that is inaccurate and has to take legal consequences for that, and for social media, that is not the case — I think that is an imbalance. And also given the power of social media and their reach with an even overproportionate effect to societies, I think that’s a pendulum that is swinging and we have to make sure that it is landing in a healthy centre.

Laura Pitel
Do you think that Brussels, the European Commission, is right to be looking into X and how its algorithms work?

Mathias Döpfner
I think it’s right to look into every platform of that dimension. I think we need a transatlantic regulation. I think EU alone regulation cannot do it. So either we find also here a transatlantic solution that other democracies can join in the world or the regulation will be inefficient. If America, which has a lower level of regulation, is deregulating, and Europe, which has a very high level of regulation, is regulating even further, then I think that is self-destructive for Europe. We are on a very dangerous path here, although I strongly advocate for a very realistic regulation that leads to a fair framework that stimulates innovation and empowers or fosters competition and the diversity that comes with it. Because all these developments, whether it’s social media, whether it’s search, whether it’s artificial intelligence — and artificial intelligence is all of that on steroids — the only question is: Is this power in the hands of very few and including autocratic or totalitarian players, or is this power in the hands of very many? And if it’s in the hands of very many and you have a healthy competition, then I’m not worried. And particularly with regard to AI, I think the opportunity is way, way bigger than the risk.

Gideon Rachman
Last question, Mathias, we were both at the Munich conference, Laura and I, and it did feel like a historic moment, but not necessarily in a good way. And I mean, your offices are right on the Berlin Wall. So you lived in Germany through an incredible historic change, which was a positive one. Do you share our view that these weeks are really history-changing, but in a slightly more alarming way?

Mathias Döpfner
One thing is for sure, the speech of vice-president Vance is a historic speech. Whether it’s turning out to be the beginning of the end of a transatlantic relationship and of a rules-based world order, or whether it turns out to be the wake-up call as it is always portrayed now, although a lot of people define that wake-up call “Now, Europe has to do it alone”, I would give it a very important twist and say not Europe alone, but America will only like to partner and continue a transatlantic relationship with a strong Europe, with a Europe that is innovative, a Europe that understands the digital opportunities, a Europe that is less regulated, a Europe that is powerful with regard to economic growth and a Europe that is strong and powerful with regards to a credible defence. If we achieve that, then it has a double effect.

On the one hand, it is the Plan B, if the transatlantic relationship really fails because then we have more autonomy as Europeans. But hopefully it leads to what I would call the real desirable scenario that a reawakened, rejuvenated Europe that is successful and strong will be a much more attractive partner for America. And then perhaps this Vance speech will turn out as the beginning of a refreshed transatlantic relationship.

So I think there is a need for a more self-critical approach. And that’s what I would like to see in Europe in a forward-looking spirit, to say we didn’t do well enough in the past, we really need America as a partner out of a position of strength, and now let’s go for it.

Gideon Rachman
That was Mathias Döpfner, chief executive of Axel Springer, ending this edition of the Rachman Review. Thanks for listening. And please join me again next week.",FEB 19 2025,Transcript,Transcript: Transatlantic alliance in danger,"Gideon Rachman and Laura Pitel talk to Mathias Döpfner, chief executive of Axel Springer",Gideon Rachman and Laura Pitel,Print this page,(opens in new window),"Gideon Rachman
Hello and welcome to the Rachman Review. I’m Gideon Rachman, chief foreign affairs commentator of the Financial Times. This week’s podcast comes from Berlin. My guest is Mathias Döpfner, the chairman and chief executive of Axel Springer, Germany’s most powerful media group. National elections take place in Germany this weekend. The far-right Alternative for Deutschland party is expected to surge to a record score in the polls. Germany’s mainstream parties shun the AfD, but the US vice-president JD Vance says that’s the wrong approach. So what future for Germany and for transatlantic relations? JD Vance voice clip
What no democracy — American, German or European — will survive is telling millions of voters that their thoughts and concerns, their aspirations, their pleas for relief are invalid or unworthy of even being considered. Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters. There’s no room for firewalls. You either uphold the principle or you don’t. Gideon Rachman
That speech by JD Vance was made in Munich just a week before the German election. His barely coded call for the AfD to be allowed into government caused shockwaves in Germany and in the conference hall of Munich, where I witnessed the reaction of the crowd. It also posed very profound questions for those Germans who are committed to their country’s long-standing alliance with America. There are few more convinced pro-Americans than Mathias Döpfner. He’s written a book called The Trade Trap, arguing for the creation of a transatlantic free trade area and for the west to curtail trade with China and Russia. He owns the German tabloid Bild and the conservative broadsheet Die Welt. And as the owner of Politico, a major news site, Axel Springer also has big business interests in the US. Döpfner is regarded as a leading conservative voice in Germany. But the Trump administration has started cancelling subscriptions to Politico, accusing it of liberal bias. It’s a reminder that in an era of tariff wars and real wars, it’s impossible to disentangle international relations, domestic politics and business. To add some business expertise, I enlisted the help of my Berlin-based colleague Laura Pitel, who came with me to the meeting at Axel Springer HQ. You’ll hear from Laura later in the interview, and this episode will be a bit longer than usual. I began with that JD Vance speech. It’s been widely denounced in Germany. Friedrich Merz, the leader of the Christian Democrats, who the polls suggest will be Germany’s next chancellor, accused Vance of open interference in German domestic politics. So what did Mathias Döpfner think about the reaction to Vance’s speech? Mathias Döpfner
I have a lot of criticism for the reaction to the Vance speech because I think that is unstrategic and I think it’s even dangerous. We need a transatlantic security alliance and we need a transatlantic trade relationship. And just to react to everything in a kind of bitter way and then calling for a kind of European isolationism, I find that very inappropriate. And yes, I think there are a lot of points in the Vance speech that I would love to discuss, where I think he has a point. And I also see a lot of things where he was, I think, intentionally misunderstood. People are saying he smashed the door and said that’s the end of the transatlantic relationship. I don’t read it like that. Gideon Rachman
OK. So what bits did you agree with? Mathias Döpfner That we have to discuss what Europe stands for and what needs to be defended. That we have to discuss how we deal with political movements, parties, voters that we fundamentally disagree with. I think the firewall discussion is an appropriate discussion. And if it’s not let in Germany, then I think it is inspiring . . . if a foreign politician is asking the question if it’s smart to simply give to 20 per cent of the voters the message that whatever you do, whatever you vote for, you will not be heard, I think everybody is free to agree on a potential coalition or not.  And I personally think it would be a big mistake to treat the AfD as a normal political movement and to form a coalition with it. But to exclude it right away, I think has made it big. And so this is a valid point and a good discussion that he had. And then also the discussion about free speech, of course, it’s interesting. Of course then you also can have the discussion, to which degree does the American administration live up to that? And then it gets interesting, it gets lively. But to just ignore it and say it’s an interference in German politics, I think that’s really stupid. Gideon Rachman
Yeah, but it seems to me that it’s quite a fine distinction you’re drawing between saying that it’s wrong to have a firewall to saying the AfD can never join a coalition. But to say but actually, personally, I think that we shouldn’t have a coalition. Mathias Döpfner
Exactly. I think that is a very important distinction, because after an election, if you won the election to decide this is a partner and this is no partner, that’s one thing. But to exclude it upfront makes it so easy for this movement to simply say we are outcasts and we are not part of the discussion. I mean, they never have to really explain it. We see it in the recent past. Just a few months ago, it was this taboo. We cannot even talk to them. We cannot invite them to a debate or to a talk show. We cannot have interviews with them and so on. What did they do? It made them bigger and bigger and bigger because it’s so easy to always be against everything, never have to really explain, never be challenged. And now suddenly that has changed. And what we see is one occasion after the other, pretty poor arguments, pretty weak defence and I think that is demystifying it. It’s, I think a valuable discussion that we have to have and it is really about the fundaments of democracy. Gideon Rachman
And you got attacked for running a piece by Elon Musk defending the AfD. But presumably, I mean when Musk says the AfD, like, there’s nothing wrong with them, they’re a perfectly normal party. In fact, both he and Vance, I think, came pretty close to endorsing them. If you have to then explain to Musk, whom you know, why you think actually the AfD are not a normal party, am I characterising your position correctly? What would you say to him in response to that piece? Mathias Döpfner
Well, I think it’s an interpretation and I cannot speak on his behalf because I’m not living in his brain. But I’m pretty sure that he sees a necessary disruption of very inefficient, dysfunctional political rituals and systems that need reform. And that’s why he is very much in favour of these disruptive movements from Milei in Argentina to Meloni in Italy to Trump in America. And he sees perhaps the AfD in Germany as the next example in that context. What I think he may underestimate is that the AfD is on many levels uncomparable to these other movements because it is in sharp contrast, for example, to Meloni, literally very pro-Russian. I mean, we just heard a recent interview where the simple fact that Russia has started the war, an aggressive war in Ukraine, was not even mentioned or criticised. So there is a very pro-Russian, pro-Chinese, and I’m speaking not about the people, but about the Communist party. And the geopolitical aggression of Putin is something that is not perceived as a threat or as a negative, but as something that we should accept and that we should have a positive relationship with. It is a party that has very, to put it mildly, wobbly positioning towards antisemitism in some parts of the party. It’s fair to say that it is in any case very anti-Israel. And you could say to a certain degree it is also very anti-American. Against, for example, American weapons on German ground. So I just think one should see these factors and not put it in comparison to these other disruptive movements that I’ve mentioned. Gideon Rachman
And what about its relationship to the Nazi past? I mean, you write quite movingly in your book about the impact on your father, your father’s generation. These guys and Musk himself said, you know, Germany’s got to take a more positive attitude to its own history. Mathias Döpfner
Whenever it’s about the remembrance of the German past, during Nazi times and the Holocaust, you get at least mixed signals. And in the very recent past, there was a Holocaust survivor speaking in the German parliament, and large parts of the AfD did not applaud. Some people even left on other occasions the room. I mean, those are gestures and we should take that seriously. Gideon Rachman
Yeah. And it seems to me that flowing from that, Germany has a particular place in this free speech debate because of the Nazi period, you got quite strict rules on what you can say and you are what maybe Musk would call a free speech fundamentalist in certain contexts. But is it still right for Germany to have a slightly different view? Mathias Döpfner
Absolutely, yes. I’m really a free speech evangelist, but I think the German history is reason enough to treat that topic differently. And if somebody denies the Holocaust, then that is under German law a crime, and I think rightly so. Gideon Rachman
Right. And yet you’re saying these guys should still be part of the political scene. And presumably, you also think that they do raise some legitimate issues. I mean, Bild has been strong on migration and so on. Mathias Döpfner
That’s the whole thing. Just because the wrong person or the wrong party or a personal party that you dislike says something that is right, you do not have to necessarily say the opposite. That’s a very dangerous trap. We spoke about some topics where I think they are fundamentally dangerous, but if it is about migration, the fact that the other German parties have addressed it too late or not decisively enough and not efficiently enough, and things are getting more and more out of control, that is something that we should just accept. And the denial of the migration problem by large parts of the political left is, I think, the most counterproductive thing because it strengthens the radical right and it leads not to less xenophobia, it leads to more xenophobia. It leads not to less racism, but to more racism. And that’s why I think it is of ultimate priority to tackle that topic. And again, just because one party says it, it doesn’t need to be completely wrong. Gideon Rachman
Yeah. I mean, if the opinion polls are right, the AfD will do well in the next election, you know, unprecedentedly well, but they won’t be in a position to form a government or even necessarily make it into a coalition. In fact, they probably won’t be in the coalition. But some people have said to me, this is the old system’s last chance, that if Merz wins and becomes chancellor, he really has to succeed, because otherwise the next election, the populists, the AfD, might win. Mathias Döpfner
Nobody really knows the exact outcome of the next election. We all have seen how un-precise the polls are, particularly if it is in the context of more very leftwing or very rightwing movements. But one thing I think is certain is really the last chance of centrist parties in Germany, because if Merz is forced after a potential win of the election to form a coalition, perhaps even with two parties, with the Greens and with the Social Democrats, and if then as a fundament for this coalition agreement, there is a very small common denominator and not enough substantial reform programme and reform action, then I think the AfD will be strengthened further and the likelihood that they would then be the biggest party four years from now is very high. And to avoid that, we need now a very determined and convincing reform agenda and structural reforms on many levels. Gideon Rachman
You know Merz very well. I assume he’s a slight unknown quantity. Well, I guess he’s been in international business, but outside those circles . . . If you have to describe him to a foreign audience, what’s he like as a person? Mathias Döpfner He’s a very serious person. He’s a real transatlanticist. He has business experience. And those are all preconditions for the reform agenda that we are all desperately waiting for. The question is, in which coalition can he do it? And the question is, how much courage does he really have personally to push things through? I mean, this famous Bismarck sentence — politics is the art of the possible — is very often misunderstood. It’s misunderstood in the sense that people think you do what is just possible at the moment because the polls are allowing it and the majority of people think like that. I think the art of the possible is to do what seems to be impossible at that very moment, and that requires courage.  Helmut Kohl has written his plan for reunification without asking the party and without asking anybody. That was leadership. And this leadership more in the spirit of Winston Churchill, that is now desperately needed. We need at least a little Churchillian moment in Germany. Gideon Rachman
Yeah. OK. So you mentioned Merz’s atlanticism and your own atlanticism. I think one of the reasons that people’s reaction — and I have to admit my reaction to Vance’s speech, I think you probably disagree with what I’ve written, but you believe in free debate — was that they felt it wasn’t just a criticism of European attitudes to free speech. He was in some sense saying we don’t recognise a community of values any more. And combining that with the fact that Trump is unilaterally opening negotiations with Putin over the heads of the Ukrainians, people are saying, gee, you know, the transatlantic alliance is in real trouble. Mathias Döpfner The transatlantic alliance is in real trouble. The trouble started in the times of Angela Merkel and Barack Obama and has not improved since then. And if we now do not redefine it, I think Europe and America will be in trouble. If the idea of America First means America Alone, it’s not going to work. It’s not going to work with regard to the big security challenges and geopolitical challenges, and it’s not going to work with regard to economic prosperity and trade.  What has the war on Ukraine and the war on Israel and the potential takeover of Taiwan in common? It’s the attack on democracy. The goal is to weaken the biggest democracy in the world. The goal is to disentangle, to split America and Europe, and with that, weaken democracy in their economies. And nobody can solve that alone. We need an alliance. And if Europe is a difficult partner because too regulated, because too slow, because of many, many aspects, yes, but still, it’s better with Europe than without. And that is also true the other way around. If the American administration is very unconventional with regard to style and communication and some decisions, maybe, but we have to understand it.  And the big European misunderstanding is that we take Trump literally, and that’s wrong. We should take Trump seriously, but we should not take him literally. And if he, for example, in the context of tariffs, is threatening Europe with an announcement of higher tariffs, then this is the invitation to dance, then this is the opening, the start of negotiations, and we do not even react to that. Instead of being kind of bitter and offended, we should now sit together and discuss the situation.  And I think the situation is pretty clear. The US is paying on average 5 per cent tariffs on European goods. Europe is paying 3.3 per cent on average on American goods, so the Americans pay higher tariffs. There is room and need for negotiation. What we have to do is we have to lower the tariffs. We have to lower the tariffs symmetrically. And in return, we have to define a common strategy and an alliance in dealing with China and other non-democratic economies. If then America and Europe would sit together in China at the negotiation table representing 800mn people, the likelihood that we are going to achieve a good outcome for a more symmetrical, for a fairer trade with China is much higher than if America does it alone, and if Europe tries it alone, it’s impossible. If we do not achieve something like that, the outcome will be really damaging and particularly for Europe. Gideon Rachman
So you haven’t given up on the theme of your book, The Trade Trap, at all? You still believe that the way to go is a transatlantic trade agreement and actually excluding the autocracies Russia and China. Mathias Döpfner
I think it is more acute than ever. That’s exactly the big question. I mean, we see and we know that the WTO is dysfunctional. I think it has to cease operations and should be replaced by a trade alliance that is way more minimalistic, more in the spirit of the old guard. But in any case, the fundament and the basis for any successful new trade architecture is the European-American alliance. It is literally inconceivable that we are not managing that because what that would then do, it would definitely strengthen the non-democratic economies. China would then, for certain, become the biggest economy in the world. The dependency of European countries, particularly of Germany from China, would be unlimited. Other autocracies in the Middle East and other players will get stronger. And Russia, we have seen, I mean, Russia is a relatively small economy, but nevertheless a very aggressive 19th-century geopolitics player. I think the combination of threats then is to be taken very seriously. Gideon Rachman
But, you know, we’re all guessing because Trump is volatile and says something surprising every day. But if I had to guess, I think he wants to lift sanctions on Russia as part of a deal with Russia. If that happens, how serious is that? Mathias Döpfner
For me, the whole Russia-Ukraine topic is a kind of test case with regard to Trump’s actions. We have seen in the past that we have to clearly distinguish announcements or statements from decisions and actions. I still do not give up the hope that the outcome of peace negotiations will be surprisingly difficult for Putin so that nobody can really call it a dictated peace, which would mean a victory of Russia, which would mean a continuation of the conflict, because a Putin who has achieved his goals will go further. It’s totally naive to think that Putin is going to stop once he has Ukraine. In the past, we have seen that the kind of situation in Georgia has just encouraged him. Then he went for Crimea. We accepted that. Then he went for large parts of Ukraine. If he achieves that, he will continue. The Baltics will be next, Moldavia in between, and one day, perhaps Poland or Germany. I mean, where is the end? And the cost and the price for the United States will get higher and higher. So I’m convinced that this administration realises that. And perhaps we just have to wait for the outcome of the negotiations. And if it’s convincing, if it’s acceptable, if it’s really a kind of fair deal that also shows to Putin, I did not achieve my goals and I should definitely not try it again, then I think we have to accept that he did it and he did it better than predicted. If it is this dictated peace and Russia wins the war, then I think it is truly a turning point in world history. Gideon Rachman
Yeah. And at that point, would even a dyed in the wool kind of atlanticist like yourself have to reassess? Mathias Döpfner
The short answer is yes. Gideon Rachman
And we may know quite soon, I guess. In your book, you start by saying the rule of law is fundamental to democracy, and it’s what saves us from fear and gives us a basis for prosperity, etc. So what do you think when — I know one shouldn’t react to everything that Trump says. That’s certainly right — but he has just put out this tweet saying, when a leader acts in the interest of saving the country, he cannot be breaking the law. And he’s pinned that. That’s a quote from Napoleon, and Musk has retweeted it with 14 American flags. That sounds like a leader saying I’m above the law. Mathias Döpfner
Yeah, that is for me exactly the red line that should never be crossed. I think every person, whether it’s a business leader, whether it’s an artist, whether it’s a scientist, and most importantly, if it’s a politician, if such a leader or an influential person thinks that she or he is above the law, this is leading to disaster. The law protects us and sometimes it protects us against ourselves. It protects us against the common sense of the moment. So we should all respect, the more power we have, that the law applies also for ourselves. Gideon Rachman
Yeah. And you write, again quite interestingly, in the book about your different encounters with world leaders. So I’d just like you to tell the story of the contrast between meeting Putin and meeting Blair. Mathias Döpfner
Well, yeah. I mean, it really illustrates that, because when I visited Putin in 2005, not only did he let me wait for a couple of hours as a gesture of authority, but also then because I really had to catch a plane in order to get back, he said, no problem, we will give you an escort. And then I went with 15 motorcycles and cars and screaming megaphones to the airport, which was quite an embarrassing experience. But of course, this also was a gesture of power to impress. And I have many meetings with other autocratic leaders who basically said, well, if there’s a problem, we fix it. They took the mobile phone, made a call and said, we are going to fix it. Whenever I had, let’s say, a real democrat, the gesture is basically, it’s interesting to hear about, I can’t do anything because we have our institutions, we have our law, we have our authorities to deal with. So this attitude “I can fix it” is for me almost an indicator that something goes wrong with the rule of law and with the respect for that. Gideon Rachman
Yeah. Last question from me before I hand over to Laura. And in a way, it’s kind of segue to it, because as a businessman, if the rule of law really is in question in America and you’re somebody who makes big transatlantic investments, you have to think twice. Don’t you? Mathias Döpfner If I look on the transatlantic relationship from a political point of view, I would always say the transatlantic alliance is way stronger than any administration, than any political leader. It should be an overriding goal and value and project. And the same is true on a company level. America is, for us, the biggest market. We are the only real transatlantic publisher. We have incredible growth in America. We believe in the prospects of the American market. If we have to deal with some setbacks, like a few days ago when suddenly Politico was identified as the arch-enemy of this administration because it’s perceived as the leftwing media symbol, then we should react a little bit more relaxed, perhaps.  I mean, for me, it’s almost funny, honestly, to see it after two and a half decades being portrayed in Germany as the centre of the rightwing conspiracy, I’m now portrayed in America as the centre of the leftwing conspiracy. Honestly, that’s exactly the position where an independent publisher should be in, and we believe in America and will continue to invest and grow in America. Laura Pitel
My questions fall on very neatly from that. The first thing I wanted to ask you about was this bout with Politico, and it’s easy to sort of laugh it off and say it’s kind of comical to have this criticism coming from both sides. But that’s, you know, also, certainly quite a serious threat coming to the media from the Trump administration. And how should big media owners like yourself handle that? Mathias Döpfner Well, first of all, I hope that it is a misunderstanding. It can only be a misunderstanding. We did not take, in 18 years of Politico’s existence, a single cent of government subsidy or government funding. What has been portrayed as government subsidy is the subscription that we are selling. So I don’t know if it’s just a misunderstanding or a mix-up between subsidies and subscription. But we are selling Politico Pro subscriptions at a high price like a Bloomberg terminal to people who are working in the sphere of politics and policy. And they need the real-time data and that in-depth analysis of Politico Pro dealing with legislation in order to do their job more efficiently. That’s why they want this product and why they pay a price for that.  To portray that as a subsidy is really an almost funny misunderstanding because if you take that seriously, that would mean that every Boeing aeroplane that the government buys is a subsidy to Boeing. Every Palantir subscription a Secret Service uses is a subsidy to Palantir. Every real estate that you rent in order to have a government office is a subsidy to the real estate firm. This can only be a misunderstanding, and I hope that it will be clarified. And listening to the speech of vice-president Vance, freedom of speech, yes, I’m very much for it. As we have said, I’m a fundamentalist, but I hope that this principle will also be upheld for journalism that you don’t like.  Laura Pitel
Do you think there’s a grain of truth in some of the Trump administration’s criticism that the media has a sort of inherent leftwing liberal bias?  Mathias Döpfner
Of course, and that is proven in many polls and analysis of media bias. That’s a fact. But I think you cannot fight a bias with a new bias. Laura Pitel
You’ve always been a big admirer of American entrepreneurs and tech pundits, people like Mark Zuckerberg, also Jeff Bezos. What do you think about how they have responded to the re-election of Trump? Do you think Jeff Bezos was right to pull out the Kamala Harris endorsement? Mathias Döpfner
That’s really interesting because I’ve asked myself, is it that they now can say what they always thought? Or is it just opportunism? Honestly, I don’t know. I don’t want to judge. I just say in our case, we have not to move or we have not to shift because we have never described Republican government as the end of civilisation or the end of democracy. But we would now also not try to sit in the first row of the inauguration. In any case, for a publisher, there’s a particular need for a certain degree of unpredictability and being not in one or the other camp. Laura Pitel
You helped to take the company private along with KKR about five years ago and recently that deal has come to an end. And now you and the widow of the founder of this company, Friede Springer, you’ve achieved what you always wanted to, which was to be the sole private owners after parting ways with KKR. Can you talk a little bit about what you want to do with that newfound freedom and what direction you’re going to take the business in? Mathias Döpfner
The new structure bears the opportunity for true entrepreneurial decisions. There are no short-term restrictions that are sometimes given by the capital markets and the publicly listed company. The goal is really to do things that will pay off in the midterm and then will make sense entrepreneurially in the long term. And I think that is truly a new freedom and a new opportunity, but also the risk exposure is higher. There is no excuse in the future. It’s only up to us to really make the right moves. Laura Pitel
There’s been speculation for some time that you’d like to make another acquisition in the US, like The Wall Street Journal is a name that always does the rounds. Is that right? Would you like to buy the Journal? Mathias Döpfner
This Wall Street Journal thing is really funny because there’s almost no interview in the last two years that I gave where I wasn’t asked about that and always in the spirit we know that The Wall Street Journal is for sale and you are going to buy. According to my information, The Wall Street Journal is not for sale. And if it would be for sale, I mean, of course, we would most likely look into it. But the likelihood that we would really buy it, that we would get it is close to zero. So I think it’s a highly theoretical topic, and that’s why it is so funny to speculate about it. Laura Pitel
You would like it. You would like to buy it if you could, let’s just say. Mathias Döpfner We have in general said we would not buy newspapers. We are a digital publisher. Our business, with the exception of two assets in Germany, Bild and Welt, which still have a kind of little print element, is a digital portfolio which is structurally growing with double-digit organic top line growth. We would double and triple check to add to this portfolio a print element.  Now there are two super brands in the world that I’m very passionate about. That is the Financial Times, which we tried to buy unsuccessfully once (chuckles) and The Wall Street Journal but I would take a bet. First of all, I don’t think The Wall Street Journal is for sale. Secondly, I think we are not going to buy it. Laura Pitel
So, not a no, I would say. Mathias Döpfner
One should never exclude it. We spoke about firewalls at the beginning of our conversation. Why would I erect a firewall? But it’s not happening. (Chuckles) Laura Pitel
Let’s ask you about the topic of Big Tech, because obviously that’s a big competitor to conventional, established journalism. You know, the likes of X, Instagram, TikTok. These are taking readers away from you in a way, and you said that TikTok should be banned in Europe. Mathias Döpfner
I said three years ago in America at the Code Conference that in every democracy of self-esteem, TikTok should be banned or sold because under this Chinese ownership, which is in a direct connection to the Communist party with regard to the usage of data and the surveillance aspects that come with it, I think it is a fundamental democracy problem and I’m very excited that now in America this problem is about to be solved through a sale to a different owner. And then TikTok is the smartest product, the algorithm in social media. And that leads to the other part of your question. I think in general, social media, it’s not black and white, it’s not good or bad. Social media is a wonderful enrichment of our media landscape. And also journalists and media brands like ours benefit from social media, but it comes also with certain side effects or developments that can be dangerous for society. For example, the principle that a publisher has to take the responsibility for everything that is published that is inaccurate and has to take legal consequences for that, and for social media, that is not the case — I think that is an imbalance. And also given the power of social media and their reach with an even overproportionate effect to societies, I think that’s a pendulum that is swinging and we have to make sure that it is landing in a healthy centre. Laura Pitel
Do you think that Brussels, the European Commission, is right to be looking into X and how its algorithms work? Mathias Döpfner
I think it’s right to look into every platform of that dimension. I think we need a transatlantic regulation. I think EU alone regulation cannot do it. So either we find also here a transatlantic solution that other democracies can join in the world or the regulation will be inefficient. If America, which has a lower level of regulation, is deregulating, and Europe, which has a very high level of regulation, is regulating even further, then I think that is self-destructive for Europe. We are on a very dangerous path here, although I strongly advocate for a very realistic regulation that leads to a fair framework that stimulates innovation and empowers or fosters competition and the diversity that comes with it. Because all these developments, whether it’s social media, whether it’s search, whether it’s artificial intelligence — and artificial intelligence is all of that on steroids — the only question is: Is this power in the hands of very few and including autocratic or totalitarian players, or is this power in the hands of very many? And if it’s in the hands of very many and you have a healthy competition, then I’m not worried. And particularly with regard to AI, I think the opportunity is way, way bigger than the risk. Gideon Rachman
Last question, Mathias, we were both at the Munich conference, Laura and I, and it did feel like a historic moment, but not necessarily in a good way. And I mean, your offices are right on the Berlin Wall. So you lived in Germany through an incredible historic change, which was a positive one. Do you share our view that these weeks are really history-changing, but in a slightly more alarming way? Mathias Döpfner One thing is for sure, the speech of vice-president Vance is a historic speech. Whether it’s turning out to be the beginning of the end of a transatlantic relationship and of a rules-based world order, or whether it turns out to be the wake-up call as it is always portrayed now, although a lot of people define that wake-up call “Now, Europe has to do it alone”, I would give it a very important twist and say not Europe alone, but America will only like to partner and continue a transatlantic relationship with a strong Europe, with a Europe that is innovative, a Europe that understands the digital opportunities, a Europe that is less regulated, a Europe that is powerful with regard to economic growth and a Europe that is strong and powerful with regards to a credible defence. If we achieve that, then it has a double effect.  On the one hand, it is the Plan B, if the transatlantic relationship really fails because then we have more autonomy as Europeans. But hopefully it leads to what I would call the real desirable scenario that a reawakened, rejuvenated Europe that is successful and strong will be a much more attractive partner for America. And then perhaps this Vance speech will turn out as the beginning of a refreshed transatlantic relationship. So I think there is a need for a more self-critical approach. And that’s what I would like to see in Europe in a forward-looking spirit, to say we didn’t do well enough in the past, we really need America as a partner out of a position of strength, and now let’s go for it.

That was Mathias Döpfner, chief executive of Axel Springer, ending this edition of the Rachman Review. Thanks for listening. And please join me again next week.",2025-02-19,This is an audio transcript of the Rachman Review podcast episode,"In this episode of the Rachman Review podcast, host Gideon Rachman interviews Mathias Döpfner, CEO of the powerful German media group Axel Springer, against the backdrop of national elections in Germany. The far-right party Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) is predicted to perform well, raising concerns about the future of German politics and its transatlantic relationships.

US Vice President JD Vance stirred controversy by suggesting that excluding the AfD from discussion undermines democracy, arguing that all voices should be considered. This remark was met with criticism in Germany, where mainstream parties refuse to engage with the AfD. Döpfner agrees that while the AfD shouldn't be normalized or included in coalitions, rejecting dialogue has amplified its support. He emphasizes the importance of addressing the concerns that drive voters towards the far-right, particularly issues like migration.

Döpfner expresses concern over the potential deterioration of the transatlantic alliance, noting that without a united front, both Europe and the US face significant geopolitical challenges. He believes a solid transatlantic trade agreement, excluding autocratic regimes like Russia and China, is crucial for mutual prosperity.

Looking ahead, Döpfner warns that if centrist parties fail to reform and address voters’ concerns effectively, the populist AfD could gain strength. He calls for bold leadership and a reassessment of how Europe engages with the US, advocating for a stronger, more innovative Europe that can work collaboratively with America.

Overall, the podcast highlights the tension between political dialogue and exclusion, the significance of maintaining strong transatlantic ties, and the challenges facing European political stability."

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Gideon Rachman
Hello and welcome to The Rachman Review. I’m Gideon Rachman, chief foreign affairs commentator of the Financial Times. This week’s podcast is about the Middle East. My guests are the president of Iraq, Abdul Latif Rashid, and Andrew England, the FT’s Middle East editor.

President Trump has astonished the Middle East and the world with his proposal that the US will, quote, take over the Gaza Strip. But given the disastrous history of American intervention in the Middle East, is there any chance of Trump’s Gaza plan happening? For many Americans and Arabs, the Iraq war remains a bitter memory and an object lesson in the folly of western intervention in the Middle East. When I met President Rashid of Iraq a couple of weeks ago, I found he took a different view. 

Abdul Latif Rashid
No, we don’t think it was a mistake because the entire population of Iraq want to get rid of the regime and we seek the help and assistance of international community, including European countries Britain, France, Germany. And at the same time, it’s as far as we are concerned, getting rid of Saddam Hussein or overthrowing Saddam was absolutely necessary for Iraq and for the region. 

Gideon Rachman
We’ll be hearing more from the Iraqi president a bit later in the show. But we’re starting this week with the Trump proposals on Gaza. I start my conversation with Andrew England by asking him if he thinks Trump’s idea has any chance of getting off the ground. 

Andrew England
No. You’ve got to assume not. I mean, it seems a completely crazy idea. I mean, firstly, you’d be in violation of international law. Just forcibly resettling Gazans, which Trump was talking about even before he announced taking over Gaza, would be in violation of international law and seen by many in the region as ethnic cleansing. It would recall memories of 1948 when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced when Israel declared independence and there was a war. To Arabs that was a catastrophe. So just that element is very hard to see. And then if you talk about the US taking over the Palestinian territory, potentially putting US troops on the ground, as Trump said he would if necessary, it brings up echoes of the US’s disastrous intervention in Iraq in 2003. Logistically, how would you do it? Who would pay for it? The Arab world, western allies, the global south would be up in arms. It just seems absolutely crazy. 

Gideon Rachman
Did you pick up any hint that this was in the works? 

Andrew England
No, not this. We had picked up hints that after the election, Trump was talking to Arab leaders about the possibility of resettling Palestinians from Gaza. But it wasn’t really taking that seriously. I mean, again, you’re dealing with Trump, this unpredictable guy who says a lot of things. What’s real, what’s not? Does he really understand the nuances of the Middle East, the complexities of the Middle East? Is he always negotiating a deal or thinking about a deal? So people didn’t really take it seriously. And then in the last couple of weeks, he started talking about the need to clean out Gaza. Horrible language. And again, Arab states rejected the idea. They reject any notion of the forcible displacement of Palestinians that has so many scars in Arab history.

The legacy is so toxic in Arab history of Palestinians being displaced from their land. And essentially, you know, that’s the root of the Arab-Israeli conflict is over land and people being displaced. So there’s no way they could countenance it. So obviously, we can’t dismiss it. But he is a character, a leader who is belligerent. He’s a bully, and he does use strange negotiating tactics where he looks to raise the stakes and then perhaps try and use that to broker the kind of deals he wants. I think what was so extraordinary, you know, did this at the White House in front of the world’s cameras with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his side. 

Gideon Rachman
What do you think Netanyahu thought? I mean, obviously, you had to be polite about it and said, you know, out-of-the-box thinking, but he must think this is crazy even. I mean, he may have his own plans. He certainly has people in his cabinet who would like to annex Gaza or bits of it. But the idea that America would take it over and kind of turn it into a beach resort is bizarre. 

Andrew England
Well, absolutely. But it is kind of interesting. You watch Netanyahu. He was almost trying to hide the smirk on his face. Look, I think from the beginning, Arabs and Palestinians have been concerned that Netanyahu and his far-right government — and this is the most extreme government in Israel’s history — wanted to make Gaza uninhabitable after Hamas’s horrific October the 7th attack in 2023. And they would want to push Palestinians across the border into Egypt. Now, the Israeli government would deny that, but that’s been the concern. I mean, look, for years there’s been talk in Americans and Israelis, you know, Gaza could be Dubai, it’s on the Mediterranean coast. It just needs developing this kind of thing. You know, if you’re a far-right Israeli politician, you don’t envisage that, including Palestinians. We have to remember Gaza is this tiny, narrow strip on the Mediterranean. It’s one of the most densely populated places in the world. For 14 months, it’s been bombed from the land, sea and air pretty much every day since Hamas’s attack on Israel. It’s a totally shattered wreck. 

Gideon Rachman
So let me then play devil’s advocate. So Trump is right when he says it’s a totally shattered wreck. And I have heard conservative Arabs say in private, well, maybe, you know, they’d be better off if they moved to Egypt, although that is a completely toxic idea in the sort of Arab discourse. But aren’t the alternatives also a bit unreal? I mean, I saw Keir Starmer saying the two-state solution. I mean, we’ve been saying that for 45 years. Do we think the other proposals, the traditional proposals are really that much more realistic than what Trump’s going on about? 

Andrew England
Well, I think we have to start and remember that Palestinians, Gazans, they see this territory as their home. These are people who’ve built their lives there. They’ve been there for generations. Many are descendants of those that were displaced in 1948. They will want to rebuild. They don’t want to be constantly resettled. You know, there’s hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees living overseas. And it’s one of the most sensitive points of the whole Arab-Israeli conflict because they want the right to go home. Of course, some Gazans will want to move and would want to try and build a new life outside of the territory, but a hell of a lot of people, they would want to stay. They do see it as the home. Now, it’s going to take a humongous effort to get anything close to a two-state solution across the line.

But then we have to ask ourselves, what are the alternatives? Because OK, you clear out Gaza. What do you do with the occupied West Bank? What do you tell the Palestinians? What does that do for those who want to pursue a militant ideology against Israel, like Hamas, who say they are fighting for the rights of the people who’ve lost their land, who justify their attacks, their killings, etc, because of the occupation? There’s no way that you’re going to be able to secure the peace that Israel wants, desires justifiably, and the Palestinians want if Palestinians are constantly pushed off the land. And no one is addressing the root causes of this conflict. 

Gideon Rachman
So I mean I’ll end with the most difficult question of all. What do you think is going to happen next? 

Andrew England
I think you’re going to have a string of Arab leaders and foreign ministers heading to Washington. We know that the Qatari prime minister is going there this week. The Saudi foreign minister is going. King Abdullah of Jordan is going next week. I think they will try and talk sense into Trump. I think Trump will come back at them and say, OK, you need to take responsibility for Gaza. You need to ensure that Hamas never rules again. You need to foot the bill for the reconstruction in Gaza. Then there’s a question of whether there can be any movement on the American plan to have Saudi Arabia normalise relations with Israel, which has always been the grand prize for Netanyahu because of Saudi Arabia’s significance in the Muslim world. And for Trump, if he wants a grand bargain for the Middle East, and he talked about this in his first term and he’s talked about it again this time. 

Gideon Rachman
And indeed, the Biden people. 

Andrew England
Well, exactly. They were pursuing it. They were very close before the October 7th attack. Now, the question is Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince de facto leader, has been very clear in recent months that Saudi Arabia cannot agree to any peace of Israel unless the establishment of a Palestinian state. That’s not necessarily because Prince Mohammed believes that that’s viable or possible, but there’s a clear awareness of the outrage that’s spread across the Arab population, particularly the younger generation, which is his main constituency, Arabs across the region on social media, watching Al Jazeera, watching the pummelling of Gaza. And that’s educated a whole generation about the Palestinian cause, the Palestinian question, occupation. And so pre-October the 7th, Mohammed bin Salman could have paid less attention to that now. I think he and other Arab leaders are very, very conscious of that anger and the risks attached to that, to their own stability and to their own security. So it’s going to be very, very hard to see how that deal gets across the line. But you’ve got to hope that Trump does want some kind of grand bargain. And if he does, then you’re going to hope that means pressing Israel to make some serious concessions towards a Palestinian state. Now, with Netanyahu’s rightwing government, that seems totally impossible. Everything seems a long shot at the moment. If that fails or if that doesn’t make progress, then the other fear is that Trump could greenlight Israel’s annexation of the West Bank, which would be another combustible act thrown into the mix. 

Gideon Rachman
And then, of course, coming back to Gaza, there is a ceasefire, but the Israelis are already talking about going back to war. Is that actually quite a likely outcome? 

Andrew England
Yes, it probably is. And we thought that when the deal was initially inked. I mean, it’s a multiphase deal. And the first phase was to last for six weeks and 33 hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, had to be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. And that was always going to be the easy. But the second phase, which is supposed to begin in a couple of weeks, that would require Israeli troops to withdraw from Gaza fully and for discussions on a permanent end to the war. And Netanyahu has made clear from the outset that he doesn’t want to pull Israeli troops out of Gaza and he doesn’t want a permanent end to the war and he wants the right to return to striking Hamas in Gaza.

And I think the optics over the last couple of weeks where you’ve seen Hamas militants in uniforms, weapons driving GMC’s, four-wheel drives, crowds of people around them, it kind of shows that rather than being destroyed, they’re still there, they’re still present. They still have a military presence. That’s had an impact on the Israeli psyche as well. After all this, Hamas is still in Gaza. That puts pressure on Netanyahu. His far-right allies in his ruling coalition. Smotrich, the finance minister, have been very clear that if they don’t go back to war in the second phase, he will pull out. That would leave Netanyahu with a minority government. So there’s already a lot of domestic pressure on Netanyahu to go back to war. And I think now, you know, after yesterday’s performance with Trump, he looked pretty confident. And after that, then he was pretty clear that he will go back to war. So, you know, the mediators will hope that they’ll get the first phase done, that there may be a gap between the first and the second phase, but they’ll continue to try and push for the second phase. But getting Netanyahu to agree to pulling all of the Israeli troops out of Gaza and the permanent ceasefire, which is what Hamas has always demanded, is going to be very, very tricky. And it becomes more so because there are, you know, less hostages alive. You know, we’ve seen live hostages coming over the last couple of weeks and now and tragically, we’re going to see bodies starting to come out.

Gideon Rachman
Do you think Hamas will keep a few hostages back, even some of the live ones, just as a, you know, a kind of disincentive to Netanyahu? 

Andrew England
Yeah, well, I mean, after the first phase, they’ll be left with the male soldiers. And I’m told that there are those that are alive. So they will have those hostages. It’s always been the question of how does Netanyahu weigh this? Does he say we must make concessions to Hamas to get the remaining hostages out or we will get the hostages out through a military force, which until this deal was agreed, was the line he took and he took it despite pretty strong pressure from the hostage families and people within his own security establishment. It serves his political interest. And he would insist that through military pressure we’ll get them out. So it’s pretty bleak. 

Gideon Rachman
That was Andrew England of the FT. The history of Iraq does at least demonstrate that countries and peoples can rebound from devastating and tragic wars. When I met President Rashid of Iraq a few weeks ago, he began our conversation by emphasising to me that the idea that his country is still wracked by conflict is now out of date. 

Abdul Latif Rashid
We don’t have conflicts in Iraq. This is a myth. Yes, we had conflicts. We had serious conflicts — wars, invasion, sanctions, terrorism the bloodbaths a few years ago.

Gideon Rachman
So the country’s at peace as far as you’re concerned?

Abdul Latif Rashid
Stability and peace, both. And we enjoy it.

Gideon Rachman
So Isis and so on is that problem completely over?

Abdul Latif Rashid
Isis is not over everywhere but is over in Iraq. We fought for a number of years against Isis and they caused a lot of damage, casualties, killing, destroying in Iraq. And before Isis, we suffered from internal terrorism. But I’m glad to see this is over. And we are all now concentrating on improving services for the people, repairing infrastructures, rebuilding towns and villages and housing projects. Caring about education and health. And we have improved our relationship with all our neighbouring countries and all the regional countries and even with the international community.

Gideon Rachman
So if Iraq has finally achieved, as you say, internal peace, but everything’s connected in the Middle East or a lot of things are connected, are you worried that you might get spillover now? 

Abdul Latif Rashid
We have recovered in Iraq but obviously, the conflicts and the troubles in the Middle East can overspill anywhere in the Middle East. We are all interconnected in almost everything. The borders in the Middle East are only about 100 years ago, and they were drawn with a lot of problems in these borders. But I’m glad for Iraq we are going in the right direction and we have corrected most of the conflicts which we had. Now we have a government. We have regular periodical elections, national election, local elections, and representatives of the nation, they assemble and they take decisions on legislation. 

Gideon Rachman
And how would you characterise our relations with Iran? 

Abdul Latif Rashid
Our relations with Iran is very good. That through its neighbours we have about 1200km of border. We have nationalities on both sides, the same nationalities on both sides. We have the same religion. We’ve shared history. We share culture. We share traits. So relationship is good. And Iran has helped us when we desperately need it during dictatorship. We had at least 4mn refugees in Iran. I was in London when Halabja’s bombed with gas. Nearly five- or 6,000 people were killed. Large areas of the country were destroyed. We lost nearly 6,000 villagers in Kurdistan. The only country which opened the door for us was Iran. 

Gideon Rachman
And Iran’s relations with the west are terrible. 

Abdul Latif Rashid
Not always. 

Gideon Rachman
OK, well with the US. And there’s an active debate in America about whether they need to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities. So how do you maintain a friendly relationship with the United States and with Iran at the same time? 

Abdul Latif Rashid
Well, we are independent countries. We can choose our friends in the world and have good communications and good relationships with them. 

Gideon Rachman
But are you worried? You know, obviously, we’ve seen the first direct exchange of fire between Iran and Israel. And there is now speculation that Trump is at least going to ramp up pressure on Iran. 

Abdul Latif Rashid
Well, I hope not, because even Iran has realised that it’s better to have good relations with international community.

Gideon Rachman
And what do you make of the fall of the Assad regime in Syria? Is that positive for Iraq or not?

Abdul Latif Rashid
Well, we have always supported the Syrian nation and the Syrian population. Syria is very close to Iraq and we have always had good trade, even political relationship with the Syrian people. But unfortunately, Assad created the turmoil in Syria and it had isolated Syria, not only himself, the entire Syria from the international community. Economic situation was bad. Conflict in Syria was happening on a daily basis and really Syria had good opportunities to correct the path, but he didn’t. We advised him many times that he should have election. And he should listen to what the opposition and what different groups see in Syria. But unfortunately, he didn’t. Now we have a new administration in Syria. From what we hear, they express positive policies. But what will happen in reality? We are waiting to see. 

Gideon Rachman
And are you worried? Because, as you said, the Isis threat has been dealt with in Iraq but there are a lot of Isis prisoners in Syria.

Abdul Latif Rashid
Even on the border. I’m worried about it. We have sealed our border towards Isis. But this is one of our concerns. And the other concern which we have about the Syrian present regime is that we want all the sections of Syrian society, Syria public, to participate in the new government of Syria. 

Gideon Rachman
Are you worried as a Kurd, the Kurds in Syria are going to be squeezed now with the Turkish becoming more powerful and so on? 

Abdul Latif Rashid
The worry is there. Initiations we spent by the Kurdish leadership in Syria has been very positive. We have contacted the new administration and they have expressed their willingness to become an active part of civil society. But they have recommended that the government should recognise all the sections of Syrian society and give all sections of Syrian society their rights. 

Gideon Rachman
And as for the north of Iraq, are you concerned that Turkey might become more assertive towards the Kurdish region?

Abdul Latif Rashid
I admit so. They are positively there. And the British forces, they are still part of the multinational forces. They know it. There is excursion in the Iraqi Kurdistan almost on a daily basis. 

Gideon Rachman
Is that relatively recent that they’ve stepped it up? 

Abdul Latif Rashid
No, it has been there for years, maybe. 

Gideon Rachman
But do you think they may become more ambitious or more aggressive now? 

Abdul Latif Rashid
Well, I hope not. But obviously their presence in northern Iraq or Iraqi Kurdistan is obvious. And now they have started influencing the decision in Syria. 

Gideon Rachman
And forgive me if I’m getting the details wrong, but there are residual American forces, I think, still in Iraq. But the plan is for them to leave. 

Abdul Latif Rashid
Well, they are part of the multinational forces. They are there on an agreement with the Iraqi government. And this agreement is based on discussions between the two sides, the Iraqi government and American government. But their presence and leaving Iraq is based on mutual understanding between the Iraqi government and Americans. 

Gideon Rachman
And do you think in the current situation it’s still a good idea for them to leave, given how much instability there is? 

Abdul Latif Rashid
Well, we haven’t asked them to leave immediately. They have some time to stay in Iraq. And after that, it will be reviewed. 

Gideon Rachman
And you said Iraq is now at peace. But how stable is the balance between the various groups that were fighting each other, between, crudely, the Sunnis, the Shias, the Kurds? 

Abdul Latif Rashid
None of them is true. The Iraqi people were fighting terrorism. The Kurds never fought the Iraqi people. They are fighting dictatorship. So this unfortunately, has not been very obvious, not very clear for many European media. 

Gideon Rachman
And do you think another misunderstanding then is that it’s often said that, well, one of the ironies of the Iraq war was that Iraq ends up very close to Iran and some even say, you know, with Iran, the most influential country? 

Abdul Latif Rashid
Apart from a period when Saddam was in power and Iraqi forces fought Iran, and that war went on for nearly eight years, there has always been a close relationship between Iran and Iraq, and that close relationship will remain. 

Gideon Rachman
Is it an equal relationship? 

Abdul Latif Rashid
Yes, because we consider and we emphasise on that with every regional country, even with the multinational forces, even with the outside forces, even with any delegation or group from Tehran, that we are an independent country and our decision’s based on our benefit of the nation. We have a parliament of 330 members which is in charge of legislation in Iraq. And then we have a government which has again been chosen and accepted by the people. And we have the president, which has again been chosen by the people. 

Gideon Rachman
So that brings me to a question. It’s now commonly accepted in the US that the Iraq war was a mistake and it should never have happened. 

Abdul Latif Rashid
No, we don’t think it was a mistake because the entire population of Iraq want to get rid of the regime and we sought the help and assistance of international community, including European countries Britain, France, Germany and at the same time, the United States. As far as we are concerned, getting rid of Saddam Hussein or overthrowing Saddam Hussein was absolutely necessary for Iraq and for the region as well. Chaos in the region, instability of the region and at the same time hurting Iraqi people. There were sanctions on Iraqi people. There was torture among the Iraqi people. We had large number of mass graves. We had large number of population living outside. And nothing could have been done in Iraq without the authority of the dictatorship. From that point of view, no. I think we are grateful for the help which we received from Britain, from the United States, from other European countries. 

Gideon Rachman
So those people in the west who say was a mistake.

Abdul Latif Rashid
Let them say it, not me. 

Gideon Rachman
Could it have been done better? 

Abdul Latif Rashid
I’m sure. I think there were some mistakes after the overthrowing of Saddam. Not before, after.

Gideon Rachman
We should probably get back to the present day. So the other conflict that’s been obsessing everyone in the region is Gaza. What do you think, firstly, of the ceasefire you have for. Is it going to last? 

Abdul Latif Rashid
Well, I’m very glad about a ceasefire. But really, this ceasefire, unfortunately, was too late. In Iraq, and I speak for everybody in Iraq, we fully support Palestinian rights for creating their own country and for self-determination. And we condemn all the action which has been taken by Netanyahu on Gaza, on West Bank, on Lebanon, on many places. I think there was no need for killing so many children, so many women, so many elderly people. It has come to 60,000. And I think the international community is responsible. We should have stopped it. We are talking about civilisation. We are talking about human rights. We are talking about self-determination. Yet in front of our eyes, 50-, 60-, 70,000 people were slaughtered and entire Gaza buildings, infrastructures, services, which . . . 

Gideon Rachman
OK. You know, I haven’t been to Iraq. So you tell me what I should know. What do you want to tell the outside world? 

Abdul Latif Rashid
You should come and visit Iraq and see it for yourself. And you can go to different governments and see the amount of war is carried out during the last few years and the problem of war. 

Gideon Rachman
So is part of the message that you want to get across that people who still think of Iraq as a zone of conflict are wrong?

Abdul Latif Rashid
Very much. 

Gideon Rachman
Are you getting a lot of foreign investment yet?

Abdul Latif Rashid
Yeah. 

Gideon Rachman
Where mainly from?

Abdul Latif Rashid
Well, mainly from Gulf states — Saudi Arabia, Qatar, many other countries. European countries on oil, on large projects, on irrigation, on water supply. You get almost every day large delegations from European countries, from North America.

Gideon Rachman
China?

Abdul Latif Rashid
China, of course, they are very much involved. 

Gideon Rachman
So do you think, oddly enough, Iraq is now a relatively hopeful story in the Middle East? 

Abdul Latif Rashid
I think the entire Middle East will be in a peaceful state if there wasn’t outside interference. 

Gideon Rachman
But on the other hand, you said outside interference in Iraq was a good thing. 

Abdul Latif Rashid
Well that, we asked for it. That’s not interference. That’s help.

That was President Rashid of Iraq, ending this edition of The Rachman Review. You also heard from my colleague, Andrew England. Thanks for listening. Who knows what will have happened by next week, but do please tune in. ",FEB 5 2025,Transcript,Transcript: Trump sets his sights on Gaza property deal,"Gideon talks to Andrew England, the FT’s Middle East editor, and Abdul Latif Rashid, president of Iraq",Gideon Rachman and Andrew England,Print this page,(opens in new window),"[MUSIC PLAYING] Gideon Rachman
Hello and welcome to The Rachman Review. I’m Gideon Rachman, chief foreign affairs commentator of the Financial Times. This week’s podcast is about the Middle East. My guests are the president of Iraq, Abdul Latif Rashid, and Andrew England, the FT’s Middle East editor. President Trump has astonished the Middle East and the world with his proposal that the US will, quote, take over the Gaza Strip. But given the disastrous history of American intervention in the Middle East, is there any chance of Trump’s Gaza plan happening? For many Americans and Arabs, the Iraq war remains a bitter memory and an object lesson in the folly of western intervention in the Middle East. When I met President Rashid of Iraq a couple of weeks ago, I found he took a different view.  Abdul Latif Rashid
No, we don’t think it was a mistake because the entire population of Iraq want to get rid of the regime and we seek the help and assistance of international community, including European countries Britain, France, Germany. And at the same time, it’s as far as we are concerned, getting rid of Saddam Hussein or overthrowing Saddam was absolutely necessary for Iraq and for the region.  Gideon Rachman
We’ll be hearing more from the Iraqi president a bit later in the show. But we’re starting this week with the Trump proposals on Gaza. I start my conversation with Andrew England by asking him if he thinks Trump’s idea has any chance of getting off the ground.  Andrew England
No. You’ve got to assume not. I mean, it seems a completely crazy idea. I mean, firstly, you’d be in violation of international law. Just forcibly resettling Gazans, which Trump was talking about even before he announced taking over Gaza, would be in violation of international law and seen by many in the region as ethnic cleansing.

And if he does, then you’re going to hope that means pressing Israel to make some serious concessions towards a Palestinian state. Now, with Netanyahu’s rightwing government, that seems totally impossible. Everything seems a long shot at the moment. If that fails or if that doesn’t make progress, then the other fear is that Trump could greenlight Israel’s annexation of the West Bank, which would be another combustible act thrown into the mix.  Gideon Rachman
And then, of course, coming back to Gaza, there is a ceasefire, but the Israelis are already talking about going back to war. Is that actually quite a likely outcome?  Andrew England
Yes, it probably is. And we thought that when the deal was initially inked. I mean, it’s a multiphase deal. And the first phase was to last for six weeks and 33 hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, had to be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. And that was always going to be the easy. But the second phase, which is supposed to begin in a couple of weeks, that would require Israeli troops to withdraw from Gaza fully and for discussions on a permanent end to the war. And Netanyahu has made clear from the outset that he doesn’t want to pull Israeli troops out of Gaza and he doesn’t want a permanent end to the war and he wants the right to return to striking Hamas in Gaza. And I think the optics over the last couple of weeks where you’ve seen Hamas militants in uniforms, weapons driving GMC’s, four-wheel drives, crowds of people around them, it kind of shows that rather than being destroyed, they’re still there, they’re still present. They still have a military presence. That’s had an impact on the Israeli psyche as well. After all this, Hamas is still in Gaza. That puts pressure on Netanyahu. His far-right allies in his ruling coalition. Smotrich, the finance minister, have been very clear that if they don’t go back to war in the second phase, he will pull out. That would leave Netanyahu with a minority government. So there’s already a lot of domestic pressure on Netanyahu to go back to war. And I think now, you know, after yesterday’s performance with Trump, he looked pretty confident. And after that, then he was pretty clear that he will go back to war. So, you know, the mediators will hope that they’ll get the first phase done, that there may be a gap between the first and the second phase, but they’ll continue to try and push for the second phase. But getting Netanyahu to agree to pulling all of the Israeli troops out of Gaza and the permanent ceasefire, which is what Hamas has always demanded, is going to be very, very tricky. And it becomes more so because there are, you know, less hostages alive. You know, we’ve seen live hostages coming over the last couple of weeks and now and tragically, we’re going to see bodies starting to come out.  Gideon Rachman
Do you think Hamas will keep a few hostages back, even some of the live ones, just as a, you know, a kind of disincentive to Netanyahu?  Andrew England
Yeah, well, I mean, after the first phase, they’ll be left with the male soldiers. And I’m told that there are those that are alive. So they will have those hostages. It’s always been the question of how does Netanyahu weigh this? Does he say we must make concessions to Hamas to get the remaining hostages out or we will get the hostages out through a military force, which until this deal was agreed, was the line he took and he took it despite pretty strong pressure from the hostage families and people within his own security establishment. It serves his political interest. And he would insist that through military pressure we’ll get them out. So it’s pretty bleak.  Gideon Rachman
That was Andrew England of the FT. The history of Iraq does at least demonstrate that countries and peoples can rebound from devastating and tragic wars. When I met President Rashid of Iraq a few weeks ago, he began our conversation by emphasising to me that the idea that his country is still wracked by conflict is now out of date.  Abdul Latif Rashid
We don’t have conflicts in Iraq. This is a myth. Yes, we had conflicts. We had serious conflicts — wars, invasion, sanctions, terrorism the bloodbaths a few years ago. Gideon Rachman
So the country’s at peace as far as you’re concerned? Abdul Latif Rashid
Stability and peace, both. And we enjoy it. Gideon Rachman
So Isis and so on is that problem completely over? Abdul Latif Rashid
Isis is not over everywhere but is over in Iraq. We fought for a number of years against Isis and they caused a lot of damage, casualties, killing, destroying in Iraq. And before Isis, we suffered from internal terrorism. But I’m glad to see this is over. And we are all now concentrating on improving services for the people, repairing infrastructures, rebuilding towns and villages and housing projects. Caring about education and health. And we have improved our relationship with all our neighbouring countries and all the regional countries and even with the international community. Gideon Rachman
So if Iraq has finally achieved, as you say, internal peace, but everything’s connected in the Middle East or a lot of things are connected, are you worried that you might get spillover now?  Abdul Latif Rashid
We have recovered in Iraq but obviously, the conflicts and the troubles in the Middle East can overspill anywhere in the Middle East. We are all interconnected in almost everything. The borders in the Middle East are only about 100 years ago, and they were drawn with a lot of problems in these borders. But I’m glad for Iraq we are going in the right direction and we have corrected most of the conflicts which we had. Now we have a government. We have regular periodical elections, national election, local elections, and representatives of the nation, they assemble and they take decisions on legislation.  Gideon Rachman
And how would you characterise our relations with Iran?  Abdul Latif Rashid
Our relations with Iran is very good. That through its neighbours we have about 1200km of border. We have nationalities on both sides, the same nationalities on both sides. We have the same religion. We’ve shared history. We share culture. We share traits. So relationship is good. And Iran has helped us when we desperately need it during dictatorship. We had at least 4mn refugees in Iran. I was in London when Halabja’s bombed with gas. Nearly five- or 6,000 people were killed. Large areas of the country were destroyed. We lost nearly 6,000 villagers in Kurdistan. The only country which opened the door for us was Iran.  Gideon Rachman
And Iran’s relations with the west are terrible.  Abdul Latif Rashid
Not always.  Gideon Rachman
OK, well with the US. And there’s an active debate in America about whether they need to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities. So how do you maintain a friendly relationship with the United States and with Iran at the same time?  Abdul Latif Rashid
Well, we are independent countries. We can choose our friends in the world and have good communications and good relationships with them.  Gideon Rachman
But are you worried? You know, obviously, we’ve seen the first direct exchange of fire between Iran and Israel. And there is now speculation that Trump is at least going to ramp up pressure on Iran.  Abdul Latif Rashid
Well, I hope not, because even Iran has realised that it’s better to have good relations with international community. Gideon Rachman
And what do you make of the fall of the Assad regime in Syria? Is that positive for Iraq or not? Abdul Latif Rashid
Well, we have always supported the Syrian nation and the Syrian population. Syria is very close to Iraq and we have always had good trade, even political relationship with the Syrian people. But unfortunately, Assad created the turmoil in Syria and it had isolated Syria, not only himself, the entire Syria from the international community. Economic situation was bad. Conflict in Syria was happening on a daily basis and really Syria had good opportunities to correct the path, but he didn’t. We advised him many times that he should have election. And he should listen to what the opposition and what different groups see in Syria. But unfortunately, he didn’t. Now we have a new administration in Syria. From what we hear, they express positive policies. But what will happen in reality? We are waiting to see.  Gideon Rachman
And are you worried? Because, as you said, the Isis threat has been dealt with in Iraq but there are a lot of Isis prisoners in Syria. Abdul Latif Rashid
Even on the border. I’m worried about it. We have sealed our border towards Isis. But this is one of our concerns. And the other concern which we have about the Syrian present regime is that we want all the sections of Syrian society, Syria public, to participate in the new government of Syria.  Gideon Rachman
Are you worried as a Kurd, the Kurds in Syria are going to be squeezed now with the Turkish becoming more powerful and so on?  Abdul Latif Rashid
The worry is there. Initiations we spent by the Kurdish leadership in Syria has been very positive. We have contacted the new administration and they have expressed their willingness to become an active part of civil society. But they have recommended that the government should recognise all the sections of Syrian society and give all sections of Syrian society their rights.  Gideon Rachman
And as for the north of Iraq, are you concerned that Turkey might become more assertive towards the Kurdish region? Abdul Latif Rashid
I admit so. They are positively there. And the British forces, they are still part of the multinational forces. They know it. There is excursion in the Iraqi Kurdistan almost on a daily basis.  Gideon Rachman
Is that relatively recent that they’ve stepped it up?  Abdul Latif Rashid
No, it has been there for years, maybe.  Gideon Rachman
But do you think they may become more ambitious or more aggressive now?  Abdul Latif Rashid
Well, I hope not. But obviously their presence in northern Iraq or Iraqi Kurdistan is obvious. And now they have started influencing the decision in Syria.  Gideon Rachman
And forgive me if I’m getting the details wrong, but there are residual American forces, I think, still in Iraq. But the plan is for them to leave.  Abdul Latif Rashid
Well, they are part of the multinational forces. They are there on an agreement with the Iraqi government. And this agreement is based on discussions between the two sides, the Iraqi government and American government. But their presence and leaving Iraq is based on mutual understanding between the Iraqi government and Americans.  Gideon Rachman
And do you think in the current situation it’s still a good idea for them to leave, given how much instability there is?  Abdul Latif Rashid
Well, we haven’t asked them to leave immediately. They have some time to stay in Iraq. And after that, it will be reviewed.  Gideon Rachman
And you said Iraq is now at peace. But how stable is the balance between the various groups that were fighting each other, between, crudely, the Sunnis, the Shias, the Kurds?  Abdul Latif Rashid
None of them is true. The Iraqi people were fighting terrorism. The Kurds never fought the Iraqi people. They are fighting dictatorship. So this unfortunately, has not been very obvious, not very clear for many European media.  Gideon Rachman
And do you think another misunderstanding then is that it’s often said that, well, one of the ironies of the Iraq war was that Iraq ends up very close to Iran and some even say, you know, with Iran, the most influential country?  Abdul Latif Rashid
Apart from a period when Saddam was in power and Iraqi forces fought Iran, and that war went on for nearly eight years, there has always been a close relationship between Iran and Iraq, and that close relationship will remain.  Gideon Rachman
Is it an equal relationship?  Abdul Latif Rashid
Yes, because we consider and we emphasise on that with every regional country, even with the multinational forces, even with the outside forces, even with any delegation or group from Tehran, that we are an independent country and our decision’s based on our benefit of the nation. We have a parliament of 330 members which is in charge of legislation in Iraq. And then we have a government which has again been chosen and accepted by the people. And we have the president, which has again been chosen by the people.  Gideon Rachman
So that brings me to a question. It’s now commonly accepted in the US that the Iraq war was a mistake and it should never have happened.  Abdul Latif Rashid
No, we don’t think it was a mistake because the entire population of Iraq want to get rid of the regime and we sought the help and assistance of international community, including European countries Britain, France, Germany and at the same time, the United States. As far as we are concerned, getting rid of Saddam Hussein or overthrowing Saddam Hussein was absolutely necessary for Iraq and for the region as well. Chaos in the region, instability of the region and at the same time hurting Iraqi people. There were sanctions on Iraqi people. There was torture among the Iraqi people. We had large number of mass graves. We had large number of population living outside. And nothing could have been done in Iraq without the authority of the dictatorship. From that point of view, no. I think we are grateful for the help which we received from Britain, from the United States, from other European countries.  Gideon Rachman
So those people in the west who say was a mistake. Abdul Latif Rashid
Let them say it, not me.  Gideon Rachman
Could it have been done better?  Abdul Latif Rashid
I’m sure. I think there were some mistakes after the overthrowing of Saddam. Not before, after. Gideon Rachman
We should probably get back to the present day. So the other conflict that’s been obsessing everyone in the region is Gaza. What do you think, firstly, of the ceasefire you have for. Is it going to last?  Abdul Latif Rashid
Well, I’m very glad about a ceasefire. But really, this ceasefire, unfortunately, was too late. In Iraq, and I speak for everybody in Iraq, we fully support Palestinian rights for creating their own country and for self-determination. And we condemn all the action which has been taken by Netanyahu on Gaza, on West Bank, on Lebanon, on many places. I think there was no need for killing so many children, so many women, so many elderly people. It has come to 60,000. And I think the international community is responsible. We should have stopped it. We are talking about civilisation. We are talking about human rights. We are talking about self-determination. Yet in front of our eyes, 50-, 60-, 70,000 people were slaughtered and entire Gaza buildings, infrastructures, services, which . . .  Gideon Rachman
OK. You know, I haven’t been to Iraq. So you tell me what I should know. What do you want to tell the outside world?  Abdul Latif Rashid
You should come and visit Iraq and see it for yourself. And you can go to different governments and see the amount of war is carried out during the last few years and the problem of war.  Gideon Rachman
So is part of the message that you want to get across that people who still think of Iraq as a zone of conflict are wrong? Abdul Latif Rashid
Very much.  Gideon Rachman
Are you getting a lot of foreign investment yet? Abdul Latif Rashid
Yeah.  Gideon Rachman
Where mainly from? Abdul Latif Rashid
Well, mainly from Gulf states — Saudi Arabia, Qatar, many other countries. European countries on oil, on large projects, on irrigation, on water supply. You get almost every day large delegations from European countries, from North America. Gideon Rachman
China? Abdul Latif Rashid
China, of course, they are very much involved.  Gideon Rachman
So do you think, oddly enough, Iraq is now a relatively hopeful story in the Middle East?  Abdul Latif Rashid
I think the entire Middle East will be in a peaceful state if there wasn’t outside interference.  Gideon Rachman
But on the other hand, you said outside interference in Iraq was a good thing.  Abdul Latif Rashid
Well that, we asked for it. That’s not interference. That’s help.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Gideon Rachman
That was President Rashid of Iraq, ending this edition of The Rachman Review. You also heard from my colleague, Andrew England. Thanks for listening. Who knows what will have happened by next week, but do please tune in. ",2025-02-05,This is an audio transcript of the Rachman Review podcast episode,"In a recent episode of The Rachman Review podcast, host Gideon Rachman discusses former President Trump's controversial proposal to ""take over"" the Gaza Strip, with guests including Iraq's President Abdul Latif Rashid and Middle East editor Andrew England. 

Rachman questions the feasibility and legality of Trump's Gaza plan, citing its potential violation of international law and the historical memory of Palestinian displacement. England describes the proposal as ""crazy,"" stressing it overlooks the complexities of the region, particularly the deep-rooted Palestinian attachment to their land. He explains that Trump's approach could incite outrage among Arab nations, particularly given their sensitive history concerning displacement.

England also touches on the complexities of regional politics, indicating that Arab leaders will likely attempt to persuade Trump to rethink his stance and take more responsibility for Gaza’s future. Rashid, however, asserts that the Iraq War was not a mistake, emphasizing the necessity of removing Saddam Hussein despite the subsequent chaos. He claims Iraq has achieved stability and is focused on rebuilding, although he acknowledges ongoing regional concerns and influences, especially from Iran.

Throughout their conversation, both guests highlight the difficulty of achieving lasting peace in the Middle East, noting that any solution must address the root causes of conflict, including the Palestinian struggle for self-determination and the impacts of foreign intervention. The podcast concludes with reflections on Iraq’s recovery and ongoing foreign investments, projecting an improved outlook for the country amidst regional challenges."

Madhumita Murgia
Hi. I’m Madhumita Murgia, AI editor at the Financial Times. And we’re going to start this episode of Tech Tonic in a night school in Tottenham, North London.

Vahap Can
All right, guys. Welcome back.

Madhumita Murgia
Which may be a strange place to start a show about Silicon Valley’s biggest tech craze, but bear with me.

Vahap Can
Today, we’re going to talk about a little bit more advanced technique related to prompt engineering, OK?

Madhumita Murgia
What you’re hearing is the Wednesday evening generative AI prompt engineering class at Capital City College. It’s a free six-week adult education course. And the idea is to teach students how to ask questions and instruct generative AI tools like ChatGPT to get the best possible results.

Vahap Can
When you’re using multistep prompts in, you need to make sure the transitions are clear, OK? So . . . 

Madhumita Murgia
Vahap Can, the instructor, spoke with our producer Josh about the class.

Vahap Can
We’re based in Tottenham and majority of the students are from local, so some learners are employed. We had students that came from a marketing background. There was a student which was in a very senior position — and she wanted to learn more about AI, how it can help her with day-to-day activities — people that were retired and just wanted to know about AI. There’s people in different sectors . . .

Madhumita Murgia
Courses like this one are becoming more ubiquitous and popular. And that’s testament to the incredible impact that generative AI has had in the two short years since it’s been available to the public. The college developed the course to respond to industry demand, but also demand from college-aged students.

Vahap Can
Students, we could say, they’re using ChatGPT to create a particular work like essay, for instance. The core principle behind when we were designing this course is for us to teach how to use ChatGPT to actually learn a particular thing. However, we then thought about professionals. So teaching students prompt engineering to basically semi automate the tasks in the day-to-day work activities.

Josh Gabert-Doyon
So wait, so this was coming out in part because you guys were getting students who were using ChatGPT for essays.

Vahap Can
Yeah. For instance, you would see them use it for reports, for essays. So rather than learning, using it as a tool to learn, they (inaudible) and use it as a tool to do the work for them. Essentially, this is a great tool for learning, for instance.

Madhumita Murgia
Courses like this one are meant to lead to more productive use of generative AI tools. If people keep going to those night classes in north London, it’s because, like all of us, they’ve been told that Gen AI is set to revolutionise the way all of us live and work. That’s certainly the assumption underpinning the business model of companies making this technology: Google, OpenAI, Microsoft and Meta. So, I wanted to have a poke around that business model. Investors are throwing money at these companies off the promise of generative AI. But then, along came China’s DeepSeek in January this year. DeepSeek matched its expensive American competitors with its own much cheaper version of the software, which begs the question: has everyone been grossly overvaluing the AI pioneers of Silicon Valley?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

$5.6mn — that’s how much it apparently cost DeepSeek to develop its large language model. Although that figure likely doesn’t include costs such as salaries and semiconductors, it’s still a fraction of the money being spent by the likes of OpenAI or Anthropic on their models.

Cristina Criddle
OpenAI is estimated burnt through about $5bn last year, which is almost as much as it raised.

Madhumita Murgia
Cristina Criddle reports on tech for the FT from San Francisco.

Cristina Criddle
And the core drivers of its spending are talent — salaries are huge in AI. Entry-level jobs are at $300,000 at OpenAI, according to the estimates I’ve seen online, which is just a crazy amount. And then there’s also the cost of compute or computing power, basically the things that you need to be able to train the models and run it. A lot of the companies anticipate that these costs are going to go up over time.

Madhumita Murgia
And that’s what makes DeepSeek’s new model such a revelation.

Cristina Criddle
What DeepSeek has done is really, come in here and shake everything up by being able to develop a reasoning model. So one that has cognitive abilities that are similar to how humans reason. They’re very similar to some leading models on the market from OpenAI and Meta. And they say that they’ve been able to do this at a fraction of the cost, with just single-digit millions to be able to train it, although those costs are sort of unclear. But if they can do that, then that just brings the costs down for everybody. And one co-founder was saying to me the other day that by making this open-source, by doing this so cheap, DeepSeek has really levelled the playing field because who is gonna pay more for a model that can do effectively the same thing when there is an open-source model out there on the market?

Madhumita Murgia
The fact that DeepSeek’s model is partially open-source means that anyone can use it for free. And that’s a problem for the US competitors who charge to access their models. It all cast doubts on the viability of the close-source business model of many leading AI firms. I wanted to drill down a bit into the details. Is this technology as much of a cash cow as its inventors claim it is? At the moment there are a few big revenue streams. The first is just simple consumer subscriptions.

Cristina Criddle
They often have a free tier, which anyone can use. And then you get a better model or better performance, or perhaps more questions you can ask in a day if you pay a little bit more.

Madhumita Murgia
But what’s a lot more lucrative for AI companies are business subscriptions.

Cristina Criddle
One company will pay a block amount for users across their company to use either ChatGPT, Claude from Anthropic, Gemini from Google. And actually, with the Google and Microsoft offerings, sometimes that can be bundled into some of the other software that they offer.

Madhumita Murgia
And then bleeding-edge AI companies also sell access to their models to other companies who can build applications on top of them.

Cristina Criddle
And they do this thing called fine-tuning, where they use the larger models to distil into smaller models and personalise it for their use cases, for their specific tasks that they want to do, or train on specific data that the company has.

Madhumita Murgia
On top of those user revenue streams, there’s also another very lucrative pathway to profit, one that’s been tried and tested by the world’s biggest tech companies, and that’s advertising.

Cristina Criddle
What I’m seeing is lots of writing and creative applications as well. I’ve seen lots of that in advertising. We’ve written that OpenAI has explored advertising as well in a very similar way where it would surface these brands in search. However, OpenAI has said that’s not imminent, but it’s definitely something it’s considering. And when you think about the sheer amounts of people using ChatGPT every day, you know, it’s hundreds of millions a week. And if they can get these sort of sponsored ads in front of people in a way that Google’s original search engine did . . . It proved very profitable for Google, so perhaps it will be the same for these AI companies.

Madhumita Murgia
Yeah, and Meta is already using AI for its existing massive advertising business, right. And we know that targeted advertising has been the whole basis for Meta and Google’s success.

Cristina Criddle
A hundred per cent. And I think in advertising, it’s just fascinating because you’re seeing them using the LLMs to really be able to help target and test advertising in real time. So what they’re able to do is suggest who a target audience for something might be, and it might not be what you would expect. For example, a Meta executive told me that if you had luxury watches, the idea might be that you should show them to men of a certain age and certain income, when in fact the LLM suggested that you show them to women instead because they were more likely to buy these watches as a present for a man in their lives.

Madhumita Murgia
Yeah, it’s kind of interesting how it is able to capture the nuance of buying psychology rather than the more crude data targeting that we’ve seen over the last decade or so.

Cristina Criddle
Absolutely. Meta has used its AI to be able to generate different backdrops for advertising. So say, it’s a lipstick, it would put a different background on the advert and it’s found that that’s really effective because once you’ve seen the same advert on Instagram more than a few times, you just get sick of it and it becomes a negative association with it. However, with their AI, they can make it look different each time, which means that you are getting that brand recognition without the user getting tired. And I know as a consumer I see the same adverts again and again and it just makes me hate the product.

Madhumita Murgia
So the brightest brains of our generation might be working on even more mind-melding advertising tactics. Still, ads and subscriptions aren’t exactly a groundbreaking new business model. And in the meantime, you have the major AI companies locked into fierce competition over users. I’m really interested in how these competitive dynamics are gonna play out. Will any one AI model gain an edge? Even before DeepSeek’s arrival on the scene, the companies making AI models were struggling to differentiate themselves. They’re all essentially selling the same thing.

Anton Korinek
It looks like this is really becoming a crowded field, and there are many players pushing into that market, producing outputs of similar quality.

Madhumita Murgia
Anton Korinek is a professor of economics at the University of Virginia who studies AI. The issue, Korinek says, is that the model builders can’t charge more for these services because the field is so competitive. When OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022, it was the only company with such an advanced chatbot. Today it’s one of many.

Anton Korinek
It turns out pretty much anybody who is willing to spend a sufficient amount of money is able to produce a GPT-4-level system. And there are many players pushing into that market producing outputs of similar quality. And if you are a business user, whether you use one or the other, makes very little difference to you. And that means you just go for whatever’s cheapest. And essentially, the incumbents have very little moat.

Madhumita Murgia
What Anton means by very little moat is that there isn’t much separating the features and performance offered by the likes of ChatGPT or other AI companies from those of potential challengers. Generative AI companies are basically in a price war. That’s why Korinek says these companies have set their sights on a much more ambitious goal.

Anton Korinek
They are essentially betting on these models rapidly becoming smarter and reaching something like human-level intelligence and beyond, within the next couple of years. And if that materialises, then they would have AI agents that are human-level intelligent at their disposal and that can pursue functions throughout the economy and generate very high financial returns based on that.

Madhumita Murgia
Aiming for human-level intelligence, what’s known in the field as AGI, makes today’s lack of profits less of an issue because whoever reaches AGI first would be able to reap huge financial rewards, at least in theory. And in the meantime, well, investors might just have to be patient. More on that after the break.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

More than two years on from the launch of ChatGPT, the big nagging questions are about the applications and the financial sustainability of generative AI. The platforms behind the leading AI tools say that the technology is going to transform our economy, but they’re facing high costs and a hyper-competitive playing field. Both of those challenges are only going to get more vexing.

Back in the classroom at Capital City College in London. Vahap Can is teaching his night school students about AI drift. Basically, when you ask AI a question and it starts to go off topic.

Vahap Can
As the example I’ve given you last week, AI is like driving a car. So prompts are your hands controlling the steering wheel. If you don’t control the steering wheel, of course the car is gonna start drifting.

Madhumita Murgia
A good prompt engineer can stop AI from going off course. Students in the class were keen to play around with novel uses for the technology.

Student 1
I typed in asking to describe what quantum computing is, and to limit such response to about 100 words.

Vahap Can
And has it come up with anything good?

Student 1
It has indeed, yeah. It’s got a nice short description of what quantum computing is.

Student 2
I’ve asked it to describe the technological innovation of using surplus heat from computation and data centres, and that’s the initial problem. And I was gonna revise the second prompt based on that output.

Student 3
For instance, I want to write an angry letter to the landlord about the high renting rate. Write an . . . uh no. Send a letter, no, email to my landlord about the ridiculous rent increase, and set the tone to be more sarcastic.

Madhumita Murgia
An angry letter to the landlord is just one of the many use cases that have come out of readily available AI. The companies offering these generative AI tools may not be making any profits, but the usage of this technology is widespread. Here’s Anton Korinek again.

Anton Korinek
Right now, they’re not profitable. Now, the flip side of that is that all of us who are consumers of this technology essentially get intelligence as a commodity, as some in the tech industry call it. We get really cheap access to amazing systems, and that’s gonna deliver productivity benefits throughout the economy.

Madhumita Murgia
Right now, the price war between AI companies means consumers are able to get AI for cheap, and AI companies hope that prolific usage will eventually translate to a profitable business model. But that hasn’t happened yet. Ultimately, it might come down to something called Jevons paradox.

Anton Korinek
Jevons paradox is the observation that for some products, when you lower the price, you can actually earn more money on it. This is, for example, something that Henry Ford already speculated on in the 1910s. He said, well, let me lower the price of my cars. (Car horns) And then ultimately, he sold many more of them because they became more affordable. So when the price goes down, the demand goes up by more than what you lost in revenue from the price cuts.

Madhumita Murgia
Jevons paradox became particularly newsworthy when Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella referenced it in relation to DeepSeek’s breakthrough in January.

Anton Korinek
The CEO of Microsoft suggested that the efficiency gains that DeepSeek had achieved through their new model architectures is going to lead to something like Jevons paradox. So I think he suggested, well, these new AI systems, they’re becoming so much more efficient. You can now run 10 copies of a GPT-4-level system on the same amount of compute that you could previously run only one on. And these are going to be so useful that people are gonna buy more than 10.

Madhumita Murgia
And Anton, what do you think? Are you convinced that Jevons Paradox is going to save the AI industry?

Anton Korinek
In the short-term, do I buy that? Probably not right away. But in the medium-term, I think it’s right. In the medium term, we are gonna have much more efficient and much more powerful AI for a cheaper price. And that’s gonna accelerate to further advancement of AI.

Madhumita Murgia
Jevons paradox is one potential outcome. It could mean low subscription prices continue. And then eventually the costs go down and the big AI companies start turning a profit. But there’s another way that things might pan out. The massive upfront costs might mean that companies cut back on the quality of the product.

Alex Chalmers
About sort of a year ago, Nathan Benaich of Air Street Capital and I co-wrote this essay where we compared these businesses to airliners.

Madhumita Murgia
Alex Chalmers is a researcher, writer and co-author of the State of AI Report. He also used to be a venture capital investor with Air Street Capital.

Alex Chalmers
They have to put a load of like capex upfront before you receive a sense of revenue to build kind of relatively undifferentiated product. And only certain ways of improving your kind of efficiency and margins, and these are often by worsening the consumer experience. So airliners do this by layering in more fees and slowly taking away the freebies and the free stuff, the frontier model companies that might be slowly reducing free usage allowances. And the other parallel between, I think, frontier model companies and airliners is that to kind of win people over, they have to keep engaging in these price wars to win hearts and minds over.

Madhumita Murgia
It’s not hard to imagine a world where generative AI is run like a budget airline, with users given crummy service and forced to pay for extra features. In the end, it might not be the technology itself that differentiates one frontier model from another, but the consumer experience. The winners and losers of the AI race might come down to who can manage the best service. I asked the FT’s Cristina Criddle how she thinks the competition between these foundation model companies will shake out.

Cristina Criddle
I think what’s gonna be really interesting is you are going to see very fierce competition and you’re gonna see these models kind of levelling the playing field quite quickly. I think the user interface is gonna be really important here. What’s gonna make users want to come back for more, be loyal to your platform. And that might not necessarily be a platform that’s run by a model maker. It might be something like Perplexity, which has, is called a wrapper where you can switch in the different models. And that’s something that Microsoft has talked about a lot as well. Having these models as a commodity and actually being able to build them, having the applications on top of them, that’s where the real, like, magic happens — and that’s what’s gonna bring consumers and businesses back. So I think we’re gonna see a lot more focus on the aesthetic of these things, the orchestration, as they say technically, but really like how people are interacting with it and how delightful it is to use and how effective it is for the things you want to use it for.

Madhumita Murgia
In this series, we’ve heard about the uses for AI and the struggle for a killer app. We’ve also broken down why there’s no obvious pathway to profitability for companies that develop AI models. In the end, these companies may end up reverting to advertising, a solid revenue stream for tech platforms like Meta and Google. In some ways, that might signal that the AI business model doesn’t have to be as revolutionary as we imagined. Ultimately, I think it’s a sign that this technology is more of a highly inventive tool than it is a hard break from the past.

Amid intense competition, what might happen is that the models produced by today’s frontrunners will fade into the background, the same way that we hardly noticed the underlying tech in our smartphones. We don’t yet know if AI will become profitable in the future. But even if it is, it may not be the companies that have come to define and dominate the sector today that will make all the money.

I’m Madhumita Murgia, AI editor at the Financial Times. And we’re going to start this episode of Tech Tonic in a night school in Tottenham, North London.  Vahap Can All right, guys. Welcome back.  Madhumita Murgia Which may be a strange place to start a show about Silicon Valley’s biggest tech craze, but bear with me.  Vahap Can Today, we’re going to talk about a little bit more advanced technique related to prompt engineering, OK?  Madhumita Murgia What you’re hearing is the Wednesday evening generative AI prompt engineering class at Capital City College. It’s a free six-week adult education course. And the idea is to teach students how to ask questions and instruct generative AI tools like ChatGPT to get the best possible results.  Vahap Can
When you’re using multistep prompts in, you need to make sure the transitions are clear, OK? So . . .  Madhumita Murgia Vahap Can, the instructor, spoke with our producer Josh about the class.  Vahap Can We’re based in Tottenham and majority of the students are from local, so some learners are employed. We had students that came from a marketing background. There was a student which was in a very senior position — and she wanted to learn more about AI, how it can help her with day-to-day activities — people that were retired and just wanted to know about AI. There’s people in different sectors . . .  Madhumita Murgia
Courses like this one are becoming more ubiquitous and popular. And that’s testament to the incredible impact that generative AI has had in the two short years since it’s been available to the public. The college developed the course to respond to industry demand, but also demand from college-aged students. Vahap Can Students, we could say, they’re using ChatGPT to create a particular work like essay, for instance. The core principle behind when we were designing this course is for us to teach how to use ChatGPT to actually learn a particular thing. However, we then thought about professionals. So teaching students prompt engineering to basically semi automate the tasks in the day-to-day work activities.  Josh Gabert-Doyon
So wait, so this was coming out in part because you guys were getting students who were using ChatGPT for essays. Vahap Can Yeah. For instance, you would see them use it for reports, for essays. So rather than learning, using it as a tool to learn, they (inaudible) and use it as a tool to do the work for them. Essentially, this is a great tool for learning, for instance.  Madhumita Murgia
Courses like this one are meant to lead to more productive use of generative AI tools. If people keep going to those night classes in north London, it’s because, like all of us, they’ve been told that Gen AI is set to revolutionise the way all of us live and work. That’s certainly the assumption underpinning the business model of companies making this technology: Google, OpenAI, Microsoft and Meta. So, I wanted to have a poke around that business model. Investors are throwing money at these companies off the promise of generative AI. But then, along came China’s DeepSeek in January this year. DeepSeek matched its expensive American competitors with its own much cheaper version of the software, which begs the question: has everyone been grossly overvaluing the AI pioneers of Silicon Valley? [MUSIC PLAYING] $5.6mn — that’s how much it apparently cost DeepSeek to develop its large language model. Although that figure likely doesn’t include costs such as salaries and semiconductors, it’s still a fraction of the money being spent by the likes of OpenAI or Anthropic on their models.  Cristina Criddle OpenAI is estimated burnt through about $5bn last year, which is almost as much as it raised.  Madhumita Murgia Cristina Criddle reports on tech for the FT from San Francisco.  Cristina Criddle And the core drivers of its spending are talent — salaries are huge in AI. Entry-level jobs are at $300,000 at OpenAI, according to the estimates I’ve seen online, which is just a crazy amount. And then there’s also the cost of compute or computing power, basically the things that you need to be able to train the models and run it. A lot of the companies anticipate that these costs are going to go up over time.  Madhumita Murgia And that’s what makes DeepSeek’s new model such a revelation.  Cristina Criddle What DeepSeek has done is really, come in here and shake everything up by being able to develop a reasoning model. So one that has cognitive abilities that are similar to how humans reason. They’re very similar to some leading models on the market from OpenAI and Meta. And they say that they’ve been able to do this at a fraction of the cost, with just single-digit millions to be able to train it, although those costs are sort of unclear. But if they can do that, then that just brings the costs down for everybody. And one co-founder was saying to me the other day that by making this open-source, by doing this so cheap, DeepSeek has really levelled the playing field because who is gonna pay more for a model that can do effectively the same thing when there is an open-source model out there on the market?  Madhumita Murgia The fact that DeepSeek’s model is partially open-source means that anyone can use it for free. And that’s a problem for the US competitors who charge to access their models. It all cast doubts on the viability of the close-source business model of many leading AI firms. I wanted to drill down a bit into the details. Is this technology as much of a cash cow as its inventors claim it is? At the moment there are a few big revenue streams. The first is just simple consumer subscriptions.  Cristina Criddle They often have a free tier, which anyone can use. And then you get a better model or better performance, or perhaps more questions you can ask in a day if you pay a little bit more.  Madhumita Murgia But what’s a lot more lucrative for AI companies are business subscriptions.  Cristina Criddle One company will pay a block amount for users across their company to use either ChatGPT, Claude from Anthropic, Gemini from Google. And actually, with the Google and Microsoft offerings, sometimes that can be bundled into some of the other software that they offer.  Madhumita Murgia And then bleeding-edge AI companies also sell access to their models to other companies who can build applications on top of them.  Cristina Criddle And they do this thing called fine-tuning, where they use the larger models to distil into smaller models and personalise it for their use cases, for their specific tasks that they want to do, or train on specific data that the company has.  Madhumita Murgia On top of those user revenue streams, there’s also another very lucrative pathway to profit, one that’s been tried and tested by the world’s biggest tech companies, and that’s advertising.  Cristina Criddle What I’m seeing is lots of writing and creative applications as well. I’ve seen lots of that in advertising. We’ve written that OpenAI has explored advertising as well in a very similar way where it would surface these brands in search. However, OpenAI has said that’s not imminent, but it’s definitely something it’s considering. And when you think about the sheer amounts of people using ChatGPT every day, you know, it’s hundreds of millions a week. And if they can get these sort of sponsored ads in front of people in a way that Google’s original search engine did . . . It proved very profitable for Google, so perhaps it will be the same for these AI companies.  Madhumita Murgia
Yeah, and Meta is already using AI for its existing massive advertising business, right. And we know that targeted advertising has been the whole basis for Meta and Google’s success. Cristina Criddle A hundred per cent. And I think in advertising, it’s just fascinating because you’re seeing them using the LLMs to really be able to help target and test advertising in real time. So what they’re able to do is suggest who a target audience for something might be, and it might not be what you would expect. For example, a Meta executive told me that if you had luxury watches, the idea might be that you should show them to men of a certain age and certain income, when in fact the LLM suggested that you show them to women instead because they were more likely to buy these watches as a present for a man in their lives.  Madhumita Murgia Yeah, it’s kind of interesting how it is able to capture the nuance of buying psychology rather than the more crude data targeting that we’ve seen over the last decade or so.  Cristina Criddle Absolutely. Meta has used its AI to be able to generate different backdrops for advertising. So say, it’s a lipstick, it would put a different background on the advert and it’s found that that’s really effective because once you’ve seen the same advert on Instagram more than a few times, you just get sick of it and it becomes a negative association with it. However, with their AI, they can make it look different each time, which means that you are getting that brand recognition without the user getting tired. And I know as a consumer I see the same adverts again and again and it just makes me hate the product.  Madhumita Murgia So the brightest brains of our generation might be working on even more mind-melding advertising tactics. Still, ads and subscriptions aren’t exactly a groundbreaking new business model. And in the meantime, you have the major AI companies locked into fierce competition over users. I’m really interested in how these competitive dynamics are gonna play out. Will any one AI model gain an edge? Even before DeepSeek’s arrival on the scene, the companies making AI models were struggling to differentiate themselves. They’re all essentially selling the same thing.  Anton Korinek It looks like this is really becoming a crowded field, and there are many players pushing into that market, producing outputs of similar quality.  Madhumita Murgia Anton Korinek is a professor of economics at the University of Virginia who studies AI. The issue, Korinek says, is that the model builders can’t charge more for these services because the field is so competitive. When OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022, it was the only company with such an advanced chatbot. Today it’s one of many.  Anton Korinek It turns out pretty much anybody who is willing to spend a sufficient amount of money is able to produce a GPT-4-level system. And there are many players pushing into that market producing outputs of similar quality. And if you are a business user, whether you use one or the other, makes very little difference to you. And that means you just go for whatever’s cheapest. And essentially, the incumbents have very little moat.  Madhumita Murgia
What Anton means by very little moat is that there isn’t much separating the features and performance offered by the likes of ChatGPT or other AI companies from those of potential challengers. Generative AI companies are basically in a price war. That’s why Korinek says these companies have set their sights on a much more ambitious goal. Anton Korinek They are essentially betting on these models rapidly becoming smarter and reaching something like human-level intelligence and beyond, within the next couple of years. And if that materialises, then they would have AI agents that are human-level intelligent at their disposal and that can pursue functions throughout the economy and generate very high financial returns based on that.  Madhumita Murgia Aiming for human-level intelligence, what’s known in the field as AGI, makes today’s lack of profits less of an issue because whoever reaches AGI first would be able to reap huge financial rewards, at least in theory. And in the meantime, well, investors might just have to be patient. More on that after the break.  [MUSIC PLAYING] More than two years on from the launch of ChatGPT, the big nagging questions are about the applications and the financial sustainability of generative AI. The platforms behind the leading AI tools say that the technology is going to transform our economy, but they’re facing high costs and a hyper-competitive playing field. Both of those challenges are only going to get more vexing.  Back in the classroom at Capital City College in London. Vahap Can is teaching his night school students about AI drift. Basically, when you ask AI a question and it starts to go off topic.  Vahap Can As the example I’ve given you last week, AI is like driving a car. So prompts are your hands controlling the steering wheel. If you don’t control the steering wheel, of course the car is gonna start drifting.  Madhumita Murgia A good prompt engineer can stop AI from going off course. Students in the class were keen to play around with novel uses for the technology.  Student 1
I typed in asking to describe what quantum computing is, and to limit such response to about 100 words. Vahap Can And has it come up with anything good?  Student 1
It has indeed, yeah. It’s got a nice short description of what quantum computing is. Student 2
I’ve asked it to describe the technological innovation of using surplus heat from computation and data centres, and that’s the initial problem. And I was gonna revise the second prompt based on that output. Student 3
For instance, I want to write an angry letter to the landlord about the high renting rate. Write an . . . uh no. Send a letter, no, email to my landlord about the ridiculous rent increase, and set the tone to be more sarcastic. Madhumita Murgia An angry letter to the landlord is just one of the many use cases that have come out of readily available AI. The companies offering these generative AI tools may not be making any profits, but the usage of this technology is widespread. Here’s Anton Korinek again.  Anton Korinek Right now, they’re not profitable. Now, the flip side of that is that all of us who are consumers of this technology essentially get intelligence as a commodity, as some in the tech industry call it. We get really cheap access to amazing systems, and that’s gonna deliver productivity benefits throughout the economy.  Madhumita Murgia Right now, the price war between AI companies means consumers are able to get AI for cheap, and AI companies hope that prolific usage will eventually translate to a profitable business model. But that hasn’t happened yet. Ultimately, it might come down to something called Jevons paradox.  Anton Korinek Jevons paradox is the observation that for some products, when you lower the price, you can actually earn more money on it. This is, for example, something that Henry Ford already speculated on in the 1910s. He said, well, let me lower the price of my cars. (Car horns) And then ultimately, he sold many more of them because they became more affordable. So when the price goes down, the demand goes up by more than what you lost in revenue from the price cuts.  Madhumita Murgia Jevons paradox became particularly newsworthy when Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella referenced it in relation to DeepSeek’s breakthrough in January.  Anton Korinek The CEO of Microsoft suggested that the efficiency gains that DeepSeek had achieved through their new model architectures is going to lead to something like Jevons paradox. So I think he suggested, well, these new AI systems, they’re becoming so much more efficient. You can now run 10 copies of a GPT-4-level system on the same amount of compute that you could previously run only one on. And these are going to be so useful that people are gonna buy more than 10.  Madhumita Murgia
And Anton, what do you think? Are you convinced that Jevons Paradox is going to save the AI industry? Anton Korinek In the short-term, do I buy that? Probably not right away. But in the medium-term, I think it’s right. In the medium term, we are gonna have much more efficient and much more powerful AI for a cheaper price. And that’s gonna accelerate to further advancement of AI.  Madhumita Murgia Jevons paradox is one potential outcome. It could mean low subscription prices continue. And then eventually the costs go down and the big AI companies start turning a profit. But there’s another way that things might pan out. The massive upfront costs might mean that companies cut back on the quality of the product.

Madhumita Murgia
This is Tech Tonic from the Financial Times. I’m Madhumita Murgia, and one thing I’ve been wondering about a lot lately in my role as the FT’s AI editor is this: loads of money is pouring into AI, but how is AI actually being used by companies? What difference is it making? Is all the fuss and money well worth it? Which is why we sent our producer, Josh Gabert-Doyon, to a call centre in London.

[AUDIO CLIP FROM CALL CENTRE]

Madhumita Murgia
At the UK’s largest utility provider, Octopus Energy, employees are doing their best to manage customer complaints and queries.

[AUDIO CLIP FROM CALL CENTRE]

It’s a big open room with a purple carpet and clusters of desks. Joe Richardson is the operations director.

Joe Richardson
Business team over there. So they look after our business energy customers. This is Will. He’s one of our experienced energy specialists. You see him on the phone with a customer. Looks like he’s updating some billing there.

Madhumita Murgia
Our producer Josh visited Octopus’s London call centre because this is one of the places where generative AI is actually being used in real life. The workers here use automatic transcriptions, AI-generated summaries of customer calls and an AI assistant that automatically drafts responses to customer queries.

Joe Richardson
So if a customer emails in, when you go to open up their email, there will be a pre-populated draft reply. We don’t send any out automatically. You can see that reply. You can edit it and then you can hit send.

Madhumita Murgia
Instead of having to figure out what went wrong with a bill or the answer to a complicated tariff question, the customer service reps at Octopus have that all figured out for them by AI.

A few years ago, during the height of the European gas crisis, Octopus took on millions of new customers from failed energy suppliers. They found themselves swamped by customer inquiries so they turned to AI, specifically a version of ChatGPT, which helps them draft an email response.

Joe Richardson
It takes away a lot of the less interesting parts of the role. If you’re someone who works in a customer-facing role like this, you love helping people but actually, like, typing out emails is not often the most fun bit. I’ve asked some of the team, I said, do you feel it like, lacks empathy though, if you’re sending it from AI? And sometimes they say, actually it’s got more empathy. He’s read that email and it said, oh, I’m very sorry to hear about your wife’s illness. It adds these touches because it’s got that time to it, which you as a busy person working in an operations team just might not have the time to do.

Madhumita Murgia
Almost half of the emails sent by the customer service team are now generated using AI. But is that actually saving the company money? Can they now, for example, cut the number of call centre workers that they need to employ?

Joe Richardson
We’re not really anticipating any kind of broad shifts in kind of moving people around different departments. But I think the nature of what people will do over time will change. But what we have noticed in 2024 is our response times have got better, our account health has got better. We’ve also noticed that it speeds up the time from a new starter to be able to get quite proficient.

Josh Gabert-Doyon
Is AI making the business more profitable?

Joe Richardson
I mean, there’s so many moving parts that I don’t think I could quantify that. But lots of things change all the time. It’s quite difficult to isolate.

Madhumita Murgia
This is something that’s been bothering me while covering AI over the past few months. How much is AI helping companies increase revenue or become more efficient? Is the technology here to stay and is it going to justify the huge amount of money that’s been bet on it by investors?

Silicon Valley has been going through an AI boom. Since ChatGPT, investors and Big Tech companies have been pouring billions of dollars into the technology, turning AI companies into some of the most highly valued in the world. But lately, investors have started to wonder when they might start seeing a return on that investment. Companies like OpenAI are burning through cash to build bigger and bigger models, while the Chinese start-up DeepSeek has proven it can be done more cheaply. The worry is that without a killer app for AI or real use cases, that return on investment might never come. It’s a worry that’s created a sharp divide in the financial community, one I wanted to hear more about.

Jim Covello
I’m Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. I’ve been at Goldman for 25 years.

Madhumita Murgia
Analyst Jim Covello has been called Wall Street’s biggest AI sceptic. He works at Goldman Sachs with his old friend George Lee, who’s much more bullish on AI.

George Lee
George Lee. I’m the co-head of the Goldman Sachs Global Institute. I have Jim beat by a few years. I’m a 30-year veteran of the firm.

Madhumita Murgia
George and Jim are Wall Street veterans. But they disagree over whether AI will ever make any money. Covello says the problem is a lack of any obvious application.

Jim Covello
You have a technology that isn’t quite ready for prime time today that’s getting more expensive. And therefore, what I’m looking for is really what applications are people going to start using and paying significant dollars for that justifies the cost of the investment.

Madhumita Murgia
George, if you could comment on, you know, why are you excited by the upside of AI? What makes you bullish about this?

George Lee
OK. First of all, I would say it’s a bet on the fact that this technology will be so generally useful that there will be use cases and demand that will emerge that we can hardly imagine today, that will soak up all this capacity and will create the predicate and platform for profitable business models. People in the legal profession, in the engineering and software area, in consulting, in media, in material science, there are sophisticated, high-paying job impact of this technology and there is adoption there.

Madhumita Murgia
Jim, do you want to come in?

Jim Covello
Sure. So far, what we’ve experienced is while they’re useful in those things, the ability to monetise any of that is limited, right? It’s a relatively small increase in efficiency. It doesn’t really allow you to replace a significant number of employees; certainly doesn’t allow you to replace any high-value employees.

Madhumita Murgia
How do you think this compares to other types of technology transitions that you’ve witnessed over the last, you know, few decades?

Jim Covello
If you start off by thinking about the history of technology transitions, the ones that have worked really well, the common element of those things in my mind are there were applications that were immediately identified that could take use of the great technology platforms that were being developed. E-commerce allowed Amazon to sell books more cheaply than Barnes & Noble from day one, so there was economic value and benefit to the user. Here, this is very expensive technology that in some cases is replacing cheap labour. If you look on some of the other technology transitions that we’ve seen over the last 30 years that maybe were less successful — think blockchain, crypto, virtual reality, metaverse, 5G — one of the common elements that they shared is the technology platforms we developed and then we tried to find solutions that could utilise the technology. And that’s more where I think AI fits.

Madhumita Murgia
George, what do you think the DeepSeek developments mean for this profitability question?

George Lee
The DeepSeek models are garnering enormous attention in this ecosystem. I think they signal what always exists in technology waves like this, which is the potential. I wouldn’t say there’s evidence yet, but the potential for discontinuous innovation that really does lower costs. And if one believes what they read about the DeepSeek models, they’ve achieved near-frontier capability at an order of magnitude less capital investment in data and computation than other models. And the good news is, if that’s true, I think it addresses many of Jim’s frontal concerns about the technology.

Jim Covello
Yeah, I think George says that really, really well. And this is something else we’ve wound up talking a lot about . . . the more costs come down with more capability, the better, right? That enables applications. It lowers the bar for applications that could generate profits for shareholders.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Madhumita Murgia
So lower costs mean AI could become more profitable. But generally I agree with Jim. AI looks like a solution in search of a problem. There are no obvious moneymaking applications yet for a technology that has been incredibly expensive to develop. But at the same time, this is general-purpose technology. It might be hard to imagine where applications will emerge in the future.

The more I’ve spoken with users of AI, the more curious I’ve become about how it might change our workplaces and how that will affect a company’s bottom line.

AI-generated voice clip
You are unique, and so am I, as well as all our colleagues, partners and customers . . . 

Madhumita Murgia
That’s an AI voice used in a staff training video at the clothing ecommerce company Bestseller. It was made by an AI company called Synthesia.

AI-generated voice clip
We all have a unique personality that makes us behave differently.

Madhumita Murgia
The voice you’re hearing is AI-generated and accompanied by a realistic-looking human, delivering their lines straight to the camera.

AI-generated voice clip 
. . . together as a team. To recruit or sell clothes, it helps to have a clear understanding of your own and others’ personality profile.

Madhumita Murgia
London-based Synthesia uses AI to make instructional videos like this for businesses to use with employees or customers. Victor Riparbelli is the start-up’s chief executive.

Victor Riparbelli
I mean, imagine you open a PowerPoint, you select an avatar and you kind of position it in the . . . in your video. And then in the speaker note, you just type the script of what you want the avatar to say. And then you have a visual aid so we can add in, you know, your images and put some text on screen, etc. It really is that simple.

Madhumita Murgia
Basically, Synthesia’s selling point is that making a video using its AI is a lot faster and cheaper than hiring a professional video producer. It also means you can make a lot more videos a lot more quickly.

Victor Riparbelli
So if you want to personalise videos to a wide variety of customers or employees, you can also do that. And what that means is that you could, for example, create, you know, 50,000 different videos for 50,000 different customers.

Madhumita Murgia
Riparbelli said he didn’t start out with a plan to make training videos, but that’s what their AI model ended up being useful for.

Victor Riparbelli
The first thing we tried to do was actually to build technology for video professionals, marketing agencies, video production companies, Hollywood studios, etc. What we realised was that the quality threshold for all the kind of video professionals was incredibly high, and it wasn’t really that . . . it was kind of a bias and not a painkiller. They weren’t really that interested and they thought it was fun to play around with. But ultimately, at the end of the day, they would still go back to doing things the way they’d always done it. And so what we realised was that there are billions of people in the world who really, really wanted to make video, but they’re not making video today because they didn’t know how to use a camera, they didn’t know how to edit it after the fact. They couldn’t get the budget from their boss, etc.

Madhumita Murgia
Synthesia is now valued at over $2bn. Still, like many other AI start-ups, Synthesia hasn’t actually made a profit yet.

A potential candidate for the killer app for AI that many people are really excited about is coding. I’ve been following AI coding companies closely, in part because Silicon Valley sees programming as exactly the kind of thing Gen AI should be good at, a task that involves writing a lot of repetitive, boring code. One of the start-ups that has emerged as a frontrunner in the world of AI coding is a company called Replit.

Amjad Masad
You describe the app you want to build. We have an agent that builds the app for you.

Madhumita Murgia
This is Amjad Masad, Replit’s founder.

Amjad Masad
And then you give it feedback and then iterate on the app. For the first time, non-developers are able to make a software that was only possible with code.

Madhumita Murgia
Venture capital investors have been all over Replit. At their last funding round in late 2023, Replit was valued at over $1bn. But does that actually translate into profitability?

Amjad Masad
We’re not profitable. I think if we really wanted to, it’s possible. But I think that given our cash position, given how much growth we are experiencing and how much growth we can experience, it makes sense to continue investing.

Madhumita Murgia
So Replit may not be profitable either, but Masad says that the customers who are using their AI coding tools are finding it a way to cut down on costs, particularly the costs spent on software-as-a-service products used by businesses, also known as SaaS. Take Sears, the famous American department store.

Amjad Masad
Sears is a 100-year-old company. And their systems were very old. They hired this really tech-forward team. And, you know, typically companies are using hundreds of SaaS tools to manage their business. But this company and this team went all in on Replit and started building AI agents instead of traditional SaaS tools. So like one tool they built is for their workers that everyday go around and take jobs for maintenance at different houses to optimise their routes and to make more money. And who’s using these tools? It’s not engineers, it’s the operations team.

Madhumita Murgia
Masad is even using Replit’s AI coding agent in his own daily life.

Amjad Masad
I use it for a lot of quantified self things. Like, you know, I was working with a sleep doctor to optimise my sleep and he gave me a sleep diary, gave me a PDF and I’m like, I’m not going to print out a PDF and like write it down. I’m probably going to forget. So I gave it to Replit Agent. I just gave it the PDF and told it make it an app and it made it an app. And now every morning I just log my sleep and it can chart things for me. I kind of can send it to my doctor. And I do that quite often with every sort of aspect of my life.

Madhumita Murgia
Masad says Replit’s tool allows users to work faster and to be more productive. So has he quantified how much more they’re getting done?

Amjad Masad
It’s hard to put a number on it, but I would say perhaps anywhere from two to five X faster. And the newer you are to programming, the more impact it has on you. I think the more experienced you are, the less impact it has on you.

Madhumita Murgia
Replit’s technology is impressive, but it still leaves me wondering about the valuation some AI companies are getting. After all, productivity hacks don’t make an industrial revolution. We’re not talking here about technology that utterly transforms the way we live, in the way electricity or the combustion engine did. In the best-case scenario, artificial intelligence might give workers more freedom. The boring work gets done by the bots and humans get more time to be creative. But there is another issue which we haven’t yet addressed. Everything depends on workers actually adopting AI in their daily work lives in the first place. More on that after the break.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

As the FT’s AI editor, I’ve spent the last year trying to figure out how AI is going to make money. Investors have been throwing tons of cash at the technology, but up until now it’s been impossible to tell exactly which applications will make a return on that investment. And much will depend on which applications workers and companies will actually want to use. So let’s head back to the London offices of Octopus Energy. You heard our producer Josh there at the start of the show. Joe Richardson, head of operations, gave Josh a demo of their generative AI tool for customer service emails.

Joe Richardson
Here’s an email. So it says, hello there. Can you let me know what my balance is and when my next direct debit will come out, so when my next payment will be made? I’m also thinking of getting an EV. What are the rates for Intelligent Octopus Go — that’s our EV tariff — and how do I get an EV charger? Fairly typical kind of questions that a customer might ask. You can see here the pre-populated reply. It says, hi, Joseph. Thanks for reaching out. It talks about your EV options and how to get an EV charger. And so if you want to use that, you can click use and then you can go in and edit it. And one thing I’ve noticed is that it’s got the proper name, whereas it’s been signed off here, so I can go in and change that. It also hasn’t included my name. So I would change that. It’s included something that wasn’t asked directly in that one, but was probably asked further back up the thread.

Josh Gabert-Doyon
Sorry, can you just explain that line that you just deleted and what it was?

Joe Richardson
Yes. So in a previous email, I’d asked about the compatibility of different cars. And so I actually, it hadn’t just looked at the last email. It replied to some unreplied questions from earlier.

Josh Gabert-Doyon
But that line about compatibility with Tesla model Y, that wasn’t a question that was asked in the email. So that seems like it’s coming out of nowhere, right? I mean, just can you read out the line?

Joe Richardson
Yeah, so it’s compatibility. Yes. A Tesla model Y is compatible with Intelligent Octopus Go. Now, actually, if I go back further back up the thread, it was a question asked last week that didn’t get an answer. The AI has found an unanswered question earlier on and replied to that. So in a way, I mean, you could leave that in and maybe say, hey, I see you asked earlier, but in a way the AI has done something that might be missed by a human there.

Madhumita Murgia
The email-writing robot got a bit muddled replying to a question further up the email chain by mistake. This seems like a pretty common experience with generative AI. It might do some useful work, but it still needs pretty close supervision. That means the nature of people’s jobs could change dramatically.

Claudia Harris
Companies underestimate how much people’s routines are disrupted by AI. And by routine, I mean how they spend 9 to 5, and the challenge for people in unlearning the routines that they’ve established over years and decades.

Madhumita Murgia
This is Claudia Harris, the co-founder of a tech-training service called Makers, which works with businesses on AI adoption. She says two years into the Gen AI boom, not that many companies are getting employees to use AI. It’s just not really catching on.

Claudia Harris
We often come across companies that buy an enterprise AI solution and are surprised the uptake across their teams is 20 per cent or less. People are given access to a new AI tool and they just don’t use it.

Madhumita Murgia
The question is: why? Well, Harris says managers and executives don’t realise how significant the shift is for employees. It’s a big change. What’s more, there’s instinctive resistance, this idea that AI will take our jobs. But Harris says that fear may be misplaced. Take the example of a spreadsheet.

Claudia Harris
When you had Excel introduced into the workplace, you might have imagined that the number of accountants would go down. But actually just the expectations of what accountancy can do went up and you needed more accountants. And I think the same is going to be true with things like software. Now that we have the ability to do more, more quickly in software engineering with AI, then what we want software to do in our world and in our lives is going to increase.

Madhumita Murgia
It’s too early to say how jobs might change with AI, but the tech industry is still hunting for the killer app. Some people are sceptical they’ll ever find it.

Sarah Myers West
The business model for this sector is in a place where it’s profoundly speculative.

Madhumita Murgia
Sarah Myers West is managing director of the AI Now Institute and a former adviser on AI to the US Federal Trade Commission.

Sarah Myers West
There’s just so much sort of testing and experimentation that’s coming from different companies. It’s the promise of cost savings rather than demonstrated cost savings.

Madhumita Murgia
West’s argument is that at this stage a lot of the big tech platforms are simply making sure that if AI becomes wildly profitable, they will be at the forefront of it.

Sarah Myers West
Both Google and Meta’s CEOs — so Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg — have said in interviews over the last year that part of why they’re making these tremendous bets is that they see the cost of underinvesting in AI as much more significant to them than overinvesting. So the vision really is one where they want to make sure that they’re able to lock people into their ecosystems for the next decade or two. And if they underinvest, they worry that they’re going to lose out, which really is a race to the bottom in terms of competition in the sector.

Madhumita Murgia
I mean, do you think there’s going to be an explosion of innovation among start-ups building using LLMs, or do you feel more sceptical of that claim and think that it’s all just going to accrue back to those making the models themselves?

Sarah Myers West
Oh, I mean, I would love to see an explosion of innovation, but I am feeling really sceptical about whether it’s going to come from start-ups in this sector. I think certainly when you look to the types of use cases that we’re seeing, they’re not the kind of like disruptive or creative societal changes that one would hope to see with, given the amount of hype around this technology. A lot of it is just, well, we’re going to automate practices that people feel have gotten a little bit boring in their lives.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Madhumita Murgia
What’s clear is that for now, there’s a sizeable gap between the ambitions for AI and the reality of its applications. So where does this leave the giants of Silicon Valley, particularly when Chinese companies like DeepSeek are at their heels? Have the likes of Google, Meta and OpenAI got their AI business model all wrong?

Voice clips from the next Tech Tonic episode
OpenAI is estimated burnt through about $5bn last year, which is almost as much as it raised.

They are essentially betting on these models reaching something like human-level intelligence and beyond within the next couple of years.

Madhumita Murgia
That’s next time on Tech Tonic.

I’m Madhumita Murgia, and one thing I’ve been wondering about a lot lately in my role as the FT’s AI editor is this: loads of money is pouring into AI, but how is AI actually being used by companies? What difference is it making? Is all the fuss and money well worth it? Which is why we sent our producer, Josh Gabert-Doyon, to a call centre in London.  [AUDIO CLIP FROM CALL CENTRE] Madhumita Murgia At the UK’s largest utility provider, Octopus Energy, employees are doing their best to manage customer complaints and queries.  [AUDIO CLIP FROM CALL CENTRE] It’s a big open room with a purple carpet and clusters of desks. Joe Richardson is the operations director.  Joe Richardson Business team over there. So they look after our business energy customers. This is Will. He’s one of our experienced energy specialists. You see him on the phone with a customer. Looks like he’s updating some billing there.  Madhumita Murgia Our producer Josh visited Octopus’s London call centre because this is one of the places where generative AI is actually being used in real life. The workers here use automatic transcriptions, AI-generated summaries of customer calls and an AI assistant that automatically drafts responses to customer queries.  Joe Richardson So if a customer emails in, when you go to open up their email, there will be a pre-populated draft reply. We don’t send any out automatically. You can see that reply. You can edit it and then you can hit send.  Madhumita Murgia Instead of having to figure out what went wrong with a bill or the answer to a complicated tariff question, the customer service reps at Octopus have that all figured out for them by AI.  A few years ago, during the height of the European gas crisis, Octopus took on millions of new customers from failed energy suppliers. They found themselves swamped by customer inquiries so they turned to AI, specifically a version of ChatGPT, which helps them draft an email response.  Joe Richardson It takes away a lot of the less interesting parts of the role. If you’re someone who works in a customer-facing role like this, you love helping people but actually, like, typing out emails is not often the most fun bit. I’ve asked some of the team, I said, do you feel it like, lacks empathy though, if you’re sending it from AI? And sometimes they say, actually it’s got more empathy. He’s read that email and it said, oh, I’m very sorry to hear about your wife’s illness. It adds these touches because it’s got that time to it, which you as a busy person working in an operations team just might not have the time to do.  Madhumita Murgia Almost half of the emails sent by the customer service team are now generated using AI. But is that actually saving the company money? Can they now, for example, cut the number of call centre workers that they need to employ?  Joe Richardson We’re not really anticipating any kind of broad shifts in kind of moving people around different departments. But I think the nature of what people will do over time will change. But what we have noticed in 2024 is our response times have got better, our account health has got better. We’ve also noticed that it speeds up the time from a new starter to be able to get quite proficient.  Josh Gabert-Doyon
Is AI making the business more profitable? Joe Richardson I mean, there’s so many moving parts that I don’t think I could quantify that. But lots of things change all the time. It’s quite difficult to isolate.  Madhumita Murgia This is something that’s been bothering me while covering AI over the past few months. How much is AI helping companies increase revenue or become more efficient? Is the technology here to stay and is it going to justify the huge amount of money that’s been bet on it by investors?  Silicon Valley has been going through an AI boom. Since ChatGPT, investors and Big Tech companies have been pouring billions of dollars into the technology, turning AI companies into some of the most highly valued in the world. But lately, investors have started to wonder when they might start seeing a return on that investment. Companies like OpenAI are burning through cash to build bigger and bigger models, while the Chinese start-up DeepSeek has proven it can be done more cheaply. The worry is that without a killer app for AI or real use cases, that return on investment might never come. It’s a worry that’s created a sharp divide in the financial community, one I wanted to hear more about.  Jim Covello I’m Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. I’ve been at Goldman for 25 years.  Madhumita Murgia Analyst Jim Covello has been called Wall Street’s biggest AI sceptic. He works at Goldman Sachs with his old friend George Lee, who’s much more bullish on AI.  George Lee George Lee. I’m the co-head of the Goldman Sachs Global Institute. I have Jim beat by a few years. I’m a 30-year veteran of the firm.  Madhumita Murgia George and Jim are Wall Street veterans. But they disagree over whether AI will ever make any money. Covello says the problem is a lack of any obvious application.  Jim Covello You have a technology that isn’t quite ready for prime time today that’s getting more expensive. And therefore, what I’m looking for is really what applications are people going to start using and paying significant dollars for that justifies the cost of the investment.  Madhumita Murgia George, if you could comment on, you know, why are you excited by the upside of AI? What makes you bullish about this?  George Lee OK. First of all, I would say it’s a bet on the fact that this technology will be so generally useful that there will be use cases and demand that will emerge that we can hardly imagine today, that will soak up all this capacity and will create the predicate and platform for profitable business models. People in the legal profession, in the engineering and software area, in consulting, in media, in material science, there are sophisticated, high-paying job impact of this technology and there is adoption there.  Madhumita Murgia Jim, do you want to come in?  Jim Covello Sure. So far, what we’ve experienced is while they’re useful in those things, the ability to monetise any of that is limited, right? It’s a relatively small increase in efficiency. It doesn’t really allow you to replace a significant number of employees; certainly doesn’t allow you to replace any high-value employees.  Madhumita Murgia How do you think this compares to other types of technology transitions that you’ve witnessed over the last, you know, few decades?  Jim Covello If you start off by thinking about the history of technology transitions, the ones that have worked really well, the common element of those things in my mind are there were applications that were immediately identified that could take use of the great technology platforms that were being developed. E-commerce allowed Amazon to sell books more cheaply than Barnes & Noble from day one, so there was economic value and benefit to the user.

And one thing I’ve noticed is that it’s got the proper name, whereas it’s been signed off here, so I can go in and change that. It also hasn’t included my name. So I would change that. It’s included something that wasn’t asked directly in that one, but was probably asked further back up the thread.  Josh Gabert-Doyon Sorry, can you just explain that line that you just deleted and what it was?  Joe Richardson Yes. So in a previous email, I’d asked about the compatibility of different cars. And so I actually, it hadn’t just looked at the last email. It replied to some unreplied questions from earlier.  Josh Gabert-Doyon But that line about compatibility with Tesla model Y, that wasn’t a question that was asked in the email. So that seems like it’s coming out of nowhere, right? I mean, just can you read out the line?  Joe Richardson Yeah, so it’s compatibility. Yes. A Tesla model Y is compatible with Intelligent Octopus Go. Now, actually, if I go back further back up the thread, it was a question asked last week that didn’t get an answer. The AI has found an unanswered question earlier on and replied to that. So in a way, I mean, you could leave that in and maybe say, hey, I see you asked earlier, but in a way the AI has done something that might be missed by a human there.  Madhumita Murgia The email-writing robot got a bit muddled replying to a question further up the email chain by mistake. This seems like a pretty common experience with generative AI. It might do some useful work, but it still needs pretty close supervision. That means the nature of people’s jobs could change dramatically.  Claudia Harris Companies underestimate how much people’s routines are disrupted by AI. And by routine, I mean how they spend 9 to 5, and the challenge for people in unlearning the routines that they’ve established over years and decades.  Madhumita Murgia This is Claudia Harris, the co-founder of a tech-training service called Makers, which works with businesses on AI adoption. She says two years into the Gen AI boom, not that many companies are getting employees to use AI. It’s just not really catching on.  Claudia Harris We often come across companies that buy an enterprise AI solution and are surprised the uptake across their teams is 20 per cent or less. People are given access to a new AI tool and they just don’t use it.  Madhumita Murgia The question is: why? Well, Harris says managers and executives don’t realise how significant the shift is for employees. It’s a big change. What’s more, there’s instinctive resistance, this idea that AI will take our jobs. But Harris says that fear may be misplaced. Take the example of a spreadsheet.  Claudia Harris When you had Excel introduced into the workplace, you might have imagined that the number of accountants would go down. But actually just the expectations of what accountancy can do went up and you needed more accountants. And I think the same is going to be true with things like software. Now that we have the ability to do more, more quickly in software engineering with AI, then what we want software to do in our world and in our lives is going to increase.  Madhumita Murgia It’s too early to say how jobs might change with AI, but the tech industry is still hunting for the killer app. Some people are sceptical they’ll ever find it.  Sarah Myers West The business model for this sector is in a place where it’s profoundly speculative.  Madhumita Murgia
Sarah Myers West is managing director of the AI Now Institute and a former adviser on AI to the US Federal Trade Commission. Sarah Myers West There’s just so much sort of testing and experimentation that’s coming from different companies. It’s the promise of cost savings rather than demonstrated cost savings.  Madhumita Murgia
West’s argument is that at this stage a lot of the big tech platforms are simply making sure that if AI becomes wildly profitable, they will be at the forefront of it. Sarah Myers West Both Google and Meta’s CEOs — so Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg — have said in interviews over the last year that part of why they’re making these tremendous bets is that they see the cost of underinvesting in AI as much more significant to them than overinvesting. So the vision really is one where they want to make sure that they’re able to lock people into their ecosystems for the next decade or two. And if they underinvest, they worry that they’re going to lose out, which really is a race to the bottom in terms of competition in the sector.  Madhumita Murgia I mean, do you think there’s going to be an explosion of innovation among start-ups building using LLMs, or do you feel more sceptical of that claim and think that it’s all just going to accrue back to those making the models themselves?  Sarah Myers West Oh, I mean, I would love to see an explosion of innovation, but I am feeling really sceptical about whether it’s going to come from start-ups in this sector. I think certainly when you look to the types of use cases that we’re seeing, they’re not the kind of like disruptive or creative societal changes that one would hope to see with, given the amount of hype around this technology. A lot of it is just, well, we’re going to automate practices that people feel have gotten a little bit boring in their lives.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  Madhumita Murgia What’s clear is that for now, there’s a sizeable gap between the ambitions for AI and the reality of its applications. So where does this leave the giants of Silicon Valley, particularly when Chinese companies like DeepSeek are at their heels? Have the likes of Google, Meta and OpenAI got their AI business model all wrong?  Voice clips from the next Tech Tonic episode OpenAI is estimated burnt through about $5bn last year, which is almost as much as it raised.  They are essentially betting on these models reaching something like human-level intelligence and beyond within the next couple of years.  Madhumita Murgia That’s next time on Tech Tonic.

Murad Ahmed
How to describe the relationship between Europe and Big Tech. Well, as people used to say on Facebook, it’s complicated. In recent years, the European Union has staked out a position as the global policeman on Big Tech. While the US leads in innovation, Brussels is setting standards in everything from online privacy to regulating artificial intelligence. It’s already fined Silicon Valley giants like Apple and Meta billions of dollars. And the EU’s crackdowns are expected to continue this year. But within Brussels, some dissenting voices are emerging — people who disagree with the EU’s hardline approach. One of the most prominent is my guest on the show today, Aura Salla, a former lobbyist for Meta and member of the European parliament.

Aura Salla
I don’t think that this regulation will hit Google, Amazon, Apple or Meta. They have an army of lawyers so I don’t think that we will catch the Big Tech. But the aim was good. But then the devil is in the details and now how we are enforcing these regulations. This is where I think we are going wrong.

Murad Ahmed
This is Tech Tonic from the Financial Times. I’m Murad Ahmed, the FT’s technology news editor. In this season of Tech Tonic, we’re asking some of the biggest questions that will shape the tech world in the year to come. In this episode, will Europe break up Big Tech?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Aura Salla, welcome to Tech Tonic. You’ve had an interesting career. You’ve worked at the European Commission. You were a lobbyist for Meta and you’ve since become a member of the European parliament. Now, during your time at Meta, you had and it was part of your job to try and influence the rules that were going to be talking about today. I think we should come out and ask the hard question straight away. What do you say to your critics, including other members of the European parliament, that say that you still remain a mouthpiece for Big Tech?

Aura Salla
Well, first of all, you skipped one year of my life. So I was actually elected to the national parliament in Finland after my three years with Meta. So I spent one really tough winter in Helsinki, and I was part of the grant committee who was also deciding on these rules. And it is super important because looking at that from the national perspective also gives you a very important perspective. We started on building these rules, what comes the digital and data economy in the EU. And I was super sceptical. And why I was so sceptical was that of course, I was using, myself, these platforms. And I saw the point on freedom of speech. Then I enter these rooms, these rooms were full of people from different age groups than I was in. And they literally told me that they had never opened a Facebook app or Twitter app back in the days. But still, these were the people who wanted to regulate these platforms, right? So it was quite interesting what kind of discussions we had on that code of practice on disinformation, microtargeting if you don’t use these apps yourself, right? So I thought that this is fascinating and I want to work on this. And I saw these endless opportunities for European companies coming from Finland, you know, knowing how Nokia actually paid the bills of our society for decades. And what that requires is data. What that requires is free market. And that’s the thing that . . . where EU got this all wrong.

Murad Ahmed
But just to push you further on your time at Meta briefly, obviously you’re saying your scepticism started before your time there, but the critique made about your outspokenness on this is that a lot of the positions that you’re taking are for Big Tech, as in are for what would benefit Meta. Do you at least accept that your free market position is actually going to be beneficial to the American larger technology companies that are also finding their own ways of squashing European tech companies?

Aura Salla
Yeah, so the story continues. After my six years with the European Commission, I got a call from a headhunter and he told me that I have a perfect position for you and it’s head of EU affairs for Meta. And I said literally that over my dead body I will go there because literally, because Cambridge Analytica just happened, you know, I said, I don’t want to work for this kind of a company who is literally misusing data and they don’t stand for their responsibilities. But then he told me that Aura, hey, go there and do it better yourself, right? You are speaking on free market, on data economy and so on and so forth. So go there and show how it’s done. And I said, OK. Like, you know, put me forward. And after many, many rounds of interviews and learning from the company, I spoke with Nick Clegg, and I have to say that he convinced me literally by saying that, you know, Aura, I would love to be the prime minister of the UK, but the position is not available for me right now. This is the next best thing because actually I have an impact and I have a global impact and this company has it. So it needs to take its responsibility. And I’m here to also work on these issues. And I thought, OK, that’s a really good point you are making. First of all, what do I know about Big Tech? I’m speaking about these things, but do I actually know how these companies function? What is the business model? How they are actually using data? No, I don’t. So I thought, OK. And I joined the company and Covid hit and many challenges also came to my table. But what I respected in that company was that, you know, how they actually said that they want to be regulated. They took a responsibility after Cambridge Analytica. They learned from that. The Covid response was immediate, you know, taking down any sceptical views on vaccination and so on and so forth. I thought that, OK these companies can actually grow up and, you know, take their responsibility. So I would say that for anyone who criticises me, where did you spend your years learning about these issues? I learned from the best. I would say in that sense that I know the business model. I know how they are using data. And also, if you saw my tweet earlier this week, I told literally that Meta, it was a huge mistake, what they’re doing now in the US.

Murad Ahmed
Everything you said, Aura, you know, it’s a great kind of story, but it seems to have been exploded in recent times. So Nick Clegg, whom you mentioned, who was a former deputy prime minister of the UK, went to be the head of policy at Meta. He’s now out of the company. We have Joel Kaplan in his place, who has deep links with the US Republican party. Mark Zuckerberg has gone and said he’s dismantling all the fact-checkers that they’ve built to check facts. He said that the Biden administration went so far to try and censor content and they bowed to it. And he regrets the things that you were saying, things like the vaccine information at Meta platforms. Surely this isn’t a big mistake. It sounds like this is where their position always was. It doesn’t come across to me that either Mark Zuckerberg or Meta, formerly Facebook, has ever been very strong on privacy and it’s constantly saying what it needs to say to avoid regulation.

Aura Salla
I was just calling to tell you that the story continues. And indeed, when Nick Clegg left, when the news hit, I thought, OK, now this is going to a wrong direction. And I think it was a huge mistake of giving up these fact-checkers. OK, now in the US. But I believe that we will see the same thing happening in the EU. And this worries me a lot because some people say that, OK, third-party fact-checkers, it’s going against freedom of speech. There is some censorship. I disagree with this. The thing is that people don’t even realise what kind of stuff people are putting out there if there is nothing holding them back. And it’s not only people. You have so many anonymous troll fake accounts and they are machinating this propaganda. And this is something that is super harmful for democracy. So for me, this is really a red line where the companies going right now. And it goes against what I believe. But I’m back in politics, of course. So I got elected, then to the Finnish parliament and now to the European parliament. And I think that the EU, yes, overregulated the market for its own companies to some extent, but also it’s getting things right. What comes the content moderation. And I think that we need to hold these companies accountable on that because the learning curve was there and they did the right things, but now is going backwards. And answering your next question, why are they doing this? I think it’s because of money. I think it’s because of data. The ultimate goal of these Big Tech companies is to make money, right?

Murad Ahmed
I was going to ask you, I mean, you did say, you know, you went to Meta to learn how it worked. And I guess my actual next question was going to be, do you feel like the wall has been pulled over your eyes, that actually Meta or the people that you were talking to then may be well-meaning, were telling you one story, but really this isn’t what they were doing. Surely this is the real Meta. This is what they’re after. It’s money, power and as little privacy and as little regulation as possible. So even well-meaning people like yourself went out to do their bidding and may have been betrayed as a result of what’s gone on.

Aura Salla
Oh, absolutely not. I’m not that naive. I always knew that their goal and aim was to make money. Absolutely not. I think the thing was that we were doing the right things and they hired people like liberals, like myself, Nick Clegg. So they knew who were they hiring because they needed us also when political field was different. In my belief, we did the right things and we hold this company also accountable. And of course, politics change. Companies change. But there is . . . I’m not that naive that I didn’t know that always the ultimate goal was to make money. Of course, collect data, develop their services, develop their products. And for Zuckerberg, as he has said now publicly time and time again, he wants to focus on metaverse. He wants to focus on AI. And what that requires is money. What that requires is data. And with this development with this company now, he can collect more data and he can make more money with Blue F, and then he can develop his services and his technology.

Murad Ahmed
Well, Aura you don’t work for that Meta any more. You are a member of the European parliament now. And so to move our attention to Europe and what the EU has been doing, you know, over recent years, it passed a series of landmark tech legislation. I think the EU and the European Commission would say that those are really targets of the world’s biggest tech companies. At least that’s their intent, it seems. And 2025 looks like a year when a lot of those laws are going to start showing their teeth. You know, there are cases out there against Apple, Meta and others. So can you paint us a picture of what the next year is going to look like? What will it mean for Big Tech in Europe and tech in Europe with this kind of regulatory landscape that we see ahead?

Aura Salla
Yeah, I would like to start by saying that I disagree with Anu Bradford, who has been flocking that, you know, this regulation is the best export product of the EU, that what this continent can have. I think that’s super worrying if that’s the case. I don’t think that any continent or any country will copy what we are doing in the EU. And why so? I don’t think that this regulation will hit Google, Amazon, Apple or Meta. What it will do is that we will just get like not that good services and products from these companies like we see now with Apple. They are trying to call around the Digital Markets Act the best possible way they can. They have army of lawyers and so on and so forth. So I don’t think that we will catch the Big Tech with this regulation. And also because this market area might be third or fourth important market area for them and they have a huge whole market where they can grow to be big. They are going to India, they are going to Asia, so on and so forth. What we actually caught with this regulatory tsunami, as they call it, is our own companies in Europe, that they are unable to scale, they are unable to grow to be big. And also, if they grow to be big, then welcome to the European Commission and we want to know your business plan and we want to split you because you are too big for this market. So I think we got it wrong right from the start. The aim was good as it normally is with the EU and with the commission. The aim is super good, but then the devil is in the details and now how we are enforcing these regulations. This is where I think we are going wrong.

Murad Ahmed
Just one question about your critique. There’s kind of two parts to it by the sound of things. The first part is that these laws don’t work. The Big Tech companies spend a lot of time trying to get around them. Or you’re also suggesting that Europe isn’t big enough for Big Tech to care. But I mean, you worked as a lobbyist for Meta. Sorry to bring this up again. It seems like these companies spend a lot of time trying to influence the EU and these laws. Why would they if they didn’t worry about their effect? And the other thing is we have seen European laws effectively written in not maybe to the US or China, the other big markets out there, but in a lot of smaller countries, this becomes a base standard for them. We’ve seen that with the GDPR laws, have really been replicated around the world. So surely there is an effect and a global effect for this.

Aura Salla
Yeah. So but you answered your own question. I would say not in the US, not in China, not in the big markets, right? In smaller markets or smaller countries, maybe yes. But not in these biggest ones who are actually having the biggest influence in a global scale.

Murad Ahmed
All together, the small markets make up a considerable market, though.

Aura Salla
Well, but they don’t. Hopefully, emerging markets are coming. But right now where this race is going on is in the US and in China. I remember 10 years ago Putin said that who will win the race on AI will win the globe. And that’s still the truth, right? And that’s what worries me, because the EU cannot compete against China and the US right now. And also what we see now, how Russia is doing its attacks here in the EU. We need strong tech market here. We need strong companies who can grow in their home market in the EU. So we need to enable them to scale up. We need to enable them to use data. And I’m speaking about metadata, traffic data so that they can develop their services. And this brings me to the next regulation. I’m sure that you want also talk about the AI act.

Murad Ahmed
Yes.

Aura Salla
Super good, right? But we need to now make sure that our own companies can actually leverage the data that we have here in the EU to develop their services, right?

Murad Ahmed
Right. Let’s get into . . . 

Aura Salla
So the enforcement is the key.

Murad Ahmed
Aura, sorry to interrupt, but I want to get into the specifics of these laws, because some of our listeners won’t know the ins and outs of them.

Aura Salla
What? Everyone has known in details of the DSA.

Murad Ahmed
We’re hoping to find a bigger audience than just in Brussels. So we’ll start with the Digital Markets Act. Again, just a quick explainer on this. This is supposed to be an act that opens up digital markets and stop Big Tech groups favouring their own services. Already we’ve seen that the laws prompted Apple to allow European iPhone users — and before you interrupt me, Aura — yes, it’s only in Europe can they download apps from other stores other than Apple’s own app store. And the EU says that this law is supposed to target gatekeepers. That’s what they call them, those really big platforms with the, I mean, it’s a market cap of over €75bn, more than a million active users in the EU and an annual turnover of 7.5bn. And out of that, they’ve only found seven gatekeepers: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, ByteDance — the owner of TikTok — and Booking.com, which is the only European company on that list. Surely this is very targeted legislation focused at the top of the industry aimed to open up competition, showing signs that it is doing that. What’s the objection here?

Aura Salla
The problem is, as you said, it’s only in the EU. So these companies outside of the EU, they can grow as big as they want in other continents, right? But our own companies, Booking.com, Zalando, other European Big Tech companies, they are trying to grow big in their home market, but then they are caught by the commission when they are growing too big. How do they ever scale up at the global stage? That’s my worry. So because the law is the same for everyone, it’s not that we can catch the Big Tech with this. I think it’s actually a really good thing that we are opening markets like Apple. Yes, I think with that company, the DSA has been performing quite well. But as you said, it’s only in the EU. My worry is: how do we scale up our own companies if they cannot grow to be big in their own home market?

Murad Ahmed
But by the time that the size they would be caught as a gatekeeper, I mean, they’d have to be huge. Booking.com is a massive company. They can cope with the additional regulatory demands, surely?

Aura Salla
Yeah, but how do they grow in global scale if these other companies can be 10 times bigger when they go outside of their home market?

Murad Ahmed
I see. To move on to the Digital Services Act, I won’t go into the gory details, but this one is much more about policing information in the sense of preventing harmful content and illegal activity online. It adds additional obligations on around 20 online platforms — groups like YouTube and Facebook. Again, this is about the proliferation of content online. And surely this is again something that we need some detailed legislation to help protect consumers.

Aura Salla
Absolutely. So we now talk about the DSA. I think the difficulty with the DSA, it’s the difficulty of how quickly we reach the context, for example, what comes to elections, what happened with Romania, Romanian elections. We can see that it’s not a tool that we can use in these kind of situations. It’s a tool that yes, OK, now we can analyse data after the elections, but it doesn’t protect us before something happens. And that’s a problem with the DSA. But my worry is that it’s not effective enough to protect our democracy with ongoing disinformation campaigns that we see in this continent. But of course, there is a counterargument that what kind of content we should be able to put out there on social media platforms, for example. And now, for example, a discussion around this Meta’s decision on fact-checkers. Some people say that, OK, fact-checking went too far because it created censorship. I’m not in this camp. I know what kind of content we can have on these platforms. And my worry is that these fake accounts and troll armies, they are coming back and how they are intervening our elections, it is more harmful for our democracy than this regulation. So I think the DSA and its enforcement, it is important for freedom of speech. It’s important for our democracy in the EU. And I think this is a good piece of legislation. However, it all depends now how the commission is also . . . what kind of a stance they are taking with X, for example. We all know that Musk is now part of the governance in the US, so it will be an interesting task for a commission of Europe and for example how they will now play this out with X. Will they put some sanctions or what will happen now when they are not playing by the rules in the EU?

Murad Ahmed
On your point about X, what do you think? We do have a new European Commission in place. And what do you think will happen on Elon Musk and X in particular? You’re in Brussels. Do you have a sense of how they may take on or back off from Musk?

Aura Salla
This will be very difficult because, of course, X is not big enough to go to the category of gatekeepers, right, because X doesn’t make any money. But also it doesn’t comply with the DSA rules right now. And how they are tweaking their algorithms, no one even knows because you need to go inside of this platform to understand them. They don’t have algorithmic transparency there. And how Musk is intervening in German elections, for example. It literally goes against the rules in the EU. But what kind of a stand the commission is ready to take, as Virkkunen said earlier this week, they might be able to sanction X, but will Musk pick up the bill? I’m not sure he will do that.

Murad Ahmed
As in you think he’ll just ignore the EU?

Aura Salla
To be honest, I don’t think that he will play by the rules, even if the commission is forcing him. And then they don’t literally have much what they can do if they don’t pay these sanctions. For these other companies, let’s say for Google, I think for them it’s a PR case to play by the rules and respect the EU regulation. It is because they have huge business here. Meta has OK business here, but I think I would claim that Google has big business here. Same with Microsoft, Amazon, even Apple, I’d say, this is a big market area for them. So for Meta, for X, I’d say of course it’s a big market area, but it’s also about collecting data. As you know, it’s basically data is the new gold or platinum even, so you can make your services better. But for Microsoft and Google, Amazon, it’s a little bit different thing because they also make money here. So I’d say for them respecting these rules, it’s important. And even though Apple is going around a bit, but other companies, they are respecting these rules. But for Musk, what does he have to lose here? So this will be difficult for the commission, definitely.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Murad Ahmed
You mentioned perhaps the most controversial piece of new legislation that’s coming in is the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act. This is probably the toughest regime on the planet on regulating AI, and its original aim seemed to be to prevent some of the more manipulative uses of AI, such as banning facial recognition systems en masse in public places. But would the development of new AI models from groups like OpenAI and Google, it’s also added a whole number of new burdens and regulations on so-called high-risk AI systems and models as well. What do you think about this particular law? This is one that US companies in particular have lobbied hard against and are deeply worried about.

Aura Salla
I would be more worried if I were a European company. Why so? This is not . . . the enforcement of the AI Act is super messy. We have 300 pages of rules and not even the best lawyers can understand the details. And in the EU, what we are lacking of is data to train our models. We are lacking of risk capital. We are lacking of single market. We are lacking of data. And we need to do basically co-operation with the US companies to be able to compete with them one day, hopefully. And what happens with the AI Act is that it says that every member state needs to have their own regulatory sandbox. And this will fragment the market ever more. I’d say in Finland, for example, we definitely want to see the best possible regulatory sandbox, which will enable our companies to build up their new models and make sure that the commission is not sanctioning them when they are doing something. But the same thing is happening in Spain, in Portugal, in Ireland. So it will be super confusing for the companies. And the second thing is that it is very difficult to enforce. And I’m worried that the different data protection authorities will have different views on how it will be enforced in different member states.

Murad Ahmed
Well, trying to put the US or Silicon Valley worldview to you as well on the AI act, I think they’re less worried about the development of European start-ups in this space as much as you’re worried about that. I have definitely heard these arguments about potential lack of competence or the complexity of these rules. But the main thing I sense is the feeling that the EU, with something like the AI act, is trying to favour its own companies. They see this as a form of protectionism to hold them back to allow Europe to catch up. You don’t think that that’s the case?

Aura Salla
To be honest with the AI act? I don’t think that these companies are too worried. And I say that they have army of lawyers that could go against this. I think that they see this as a, you know, part of the cost of doing business here. That’s why I’m speaking on behalf of our scale-ups, not even start-ups, because actually these start-ups are quite protected. But it’s for the scale-ups in the EU that we need to be most worried about. I think it’s because we have such a layered regulatory environment. We have GDPR, then we have like a Data act, Data Governance act, AI act, and you need to be super aware on all of these regulations so that you are not caught, I’d say. So for these Big Tech companies, they try to navigate and think, OK, so I launch this product here or this service here. Will it cost me more or will I get more business with that? But I wouldn’t be worried about the US tech companies that they couldn’t navigate these regulations here in the EU, no matter what they say. But I am worried about our own scale-ups.

Murad Ahmed
And you’ve expressed that worry well. I mean, it’s going to be a critical year ahead to see if the European start-ups particularly in AI can find a way competing against the rest, I guess the time is going to tell. One thing I’d say is that inherent inside a lot of these laws, the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act is a sanction and an ultimate sanction being the potential break-up of these Big Tech companies. Do you think that could ever happen? What do these companies need to do for a break-up to occur? Do you think the EU’s got a stomach for that level of fight?

Aura Salla
This is where the EU got it wrong. The EU cannot break off Meta or Google or Amazon or Apple, right? This is . . . it’s not their whole market. If someone breaks these companies up, it’s the US government. It’s their problem, so to say, and they don’t see it as a problem. They want to have these big companies in that continent thrive. OK, we can tell these companies that they don’t function in this market area or we don’t want this and that services here in our market area because we want to protect our own companies and their growth. The problem is that the same regulation hits our own companies. And this is where I think we went wrong. So now for the next term, but I, my wish to the new commission is that please let’s not put out there, no more regulation. Let’s take a break. Let’s see the enforcement, how our companies can navigate, how they can grow and what they need. The Big Tech companies from the US, for them it’s quite clear that they need to respect these rules here. But the thing is that now for this term, the focus needs to be in our own companies here in Europe.

Murad Ahmed
And just before we get into this term and in the year ahead and the commission’s new term, going back on the break-up, is it just the EU that would be pushing for a break-up? I mean, if the actions anywhere, it’s the US. There’s an incoming Trump administration. I think it’s a little bit unclear at this stage how they feel about Big Tech, but there’s certainly sceptics within that administration. And there’s an ongoing US antitrust case against Google with a sanction that’s being discussed at the moment is a sale of its Chrome browser or even a sale of their Android mobile operating system, an unprecedented penalty. And that is where we’ve got to in laissez-faire United States, which has got plenty of capital and fewer regulations, even they can see that the power of these companies has gone too far. Surely it’s a kind of united front around the world, but the EU is very much included in, to try and stand up to this power.

Aura Salla
As I said, it needs to come from the US. These are US companies. We can break these companies or their services or products or whatever their business model up here in the EU. But it’s not enough. They are so big at the global scale. So as you said, yeah, in the ideal world we would team up with the US and we would break these companies. But will Musk and Trump and their administration be ready to do that? We need to see a couple of more months at least, because we don’t know what, where they are now heading to. Musk is maybe buying now TikTok next. And as you can see also Zuckerberg completely changed his mind all of a sudden and is now in the same camp with Trump. So I wouldn’t know how to predict the future right now with the US. We need to see first where this new administration is heading to. But I wouldn’t hold my breath that they will team up with the EU and start splitting big companies that would also hit Musk and Tesla and so on and so forth. So let’s see. But I wouldn’t say that we are in that path right now.

Murad Ahmed
I will ask you to look into your crystal ball a little bit to see what the future looks like. But I’ll ask you what the future looks like in the EU. We do have a new commission. What do you think they will do? Do you think it’s a commission that’s closer to your worldview, which is let’s take a pause in regulation. Let’s see how the existing ones operate and think about the home market. Or do you think they’ll press forward?

Aura Salla
Definitely they will press forward. I really hope they would be in my camp, but they will not be. Because, you know, when a politician takes an office, what happens is that, you know, you want to leave your stamp to the history, right? And it’s not going to happen by deregulation. It’s going to happen with the regulation. And you want to see Lex Virkkunen or you want to see Lex von der Leyen. And when you are looking at those mission letters that they wrote to the commissioners, you can see that there already are signs that we will have more regulation, we will see more financial instruments again. And I think that the Digital Fairness Act is something that will now be cooking. And I think that they will add up their everything that was left out from the DSA or other regulations. I think there will be something coming around privacy, around data, maybe disinformation. Publishers are definitely not happy in the EU still. So I would say that’s my biggest worry now — that they will keep going and keep regulating ever more.

Murad Ahmed
Well, let’s see how much of an effect you have in the coming year. I’m sure you’ll be a vocal, if perhaps relatively lonely voice out there in Brussels. Aura Salla, thank you for your time.

Aura Salla
Thank you so much.

Well, as people used to say on Facebook, it’s complicated. In recent years, the European Union has staked out a position as the global policeman on Big Tech. While the US leads in innovation, Brussels is setting standards in everything from online privacy to regulating artificial intelligence. It’s already fined Silicon Valley giants like Apple and Meta billions of dollars. And the EU’s crackdowns are expected to continue this year. But within Brussels, some dissenting voices are emerging — people who disagree with the EU’s hardline approach. One of the most prominent is my guest on the show today, Aura Salla, a former lobbyist for Meta and member of the European parliament.  Aura Salla I don’t think that this regulation will hit Google, Amazon, Apple or Meta. They have an army of lawyers so I don’t think that we will catch the Big Tech. But the aim was good. But then the devil is in the details and now how we are enforcing these regulations. This is where I think we are going wrong.  Murad Ahmed This is Tech Tonic from the Financial Times. I’m Murad Ahmed, the FT’s technology news editor. In this season of Tech Tonic, we’re asking some of the biggest questions that will shape the tech world in the year to come. In this episode, will Europe break up Big Tech?  [MUSIC PLAYING]  Aura Salla, welcome to Tech Tonic. You’ve had an interesting career. You’ve worked at the European Commission. You were a lobbyist for Meta and you’ve since become a member of the European parliament. Now, during your time at Meta, you had and it was part of your job to try and influence the rules that were going to be talking about today. I think we should come out and ask the hard question straight away. What do you say to your critics, including other members of the European parliament, that say that you still remain a mouthpiece for Big Tech?  Aura Salla Well, first of all, you skipped one year of my life. So I was actually elected to the national parliament in Finland after my three years with Meta. So I spent one really tough winter in Helsinki, and I was part of the grant committee who was also deciding on these rules. And it is super important because looking at that from the national perspective also gives you a very important perspective. We started on building these rules, what comes the digital and data economy in the EU. And I was super sceptical. And why I was so sceptical was that of course, I was using, myself, these platforms. And I saw the point on freedom of speech. Then I enter these rooms, these rooms were full of people from different age groups than I was in. And they literally told me that they had never opened a Facebook app or Twitter app back in the days. But still, these were the people who wanted to regulate these platforms, right? So it was quite interesting what kind of discussions we had on that code of practice on disinformation, microtargeting if you don’t use these apps yourself, right? So I thought that this is fascinating and I want to work on this. And I saw these endless opportunities for European companies coming from Finland, you know, knowing how Nokia actually paid the bills of our society for decades. And what that requires is data. What that requires is free market. And that’s the thing that . . . where EU got this all wrong.  Murad Ahmed But just to push you further on your time at Meta briefly, obviously you’re saying your scepticism started before your time there, but the critique made about your outspokenness on this is that a lot of the positions that you’re taking are for Big Tech, as in are for what would benefit Meta. Do you at least accept that your free market position is actually going to be beneficial to the American larger technology companies that are also finding their own ways of squashing European tech companies?  Aura Salla Yeah, so the story continues. After my six years with the European Commission, I got a call from a headhunter and he told me that I have a perfect position for you and it’s head of EU affairs for Meta. And I said literally that over my dead body I will go there because literally, because Cambridge Analytica just happened, you know, I said, I don’t want to work for this kind of a company who is literally misusing data and they don’t stand for their responsibilities. But then he told me that Aura, hey, go there and do it better yourself, right? You are speaking on free market, on data economy and so on and so forth. So go there and show how it’s done. And I said, OK. Like, you know, put me forward. And after many, many rounds of interviews and learning from the company, I spoke with Nick Clegg, and I have to say that he convinced me literally by saying that, you know, Aura, I would love to be the prime minister of the UK, but the position is not available for me right now. This is the next best thing because actually I have an impact and I have a global impact and this company has it. So it needs to take its responsibility. And I’m here to also work on these issues. And I thought, OK, that’s a really good point you are making. First of all, what do I know about Big Tech? I’m speaking about these things, but do I actually know how these companies function? What is the business model? How they are actually using data? No, I don’t. So I thought, OK. And I joined the company and Covid hit and many challenges also came to my table. But what I respected in that company was that, you know, how they actually said that they want to be regulated. They took a responsibility after Cambridge Analytica. They learned from that. The Covid response was immediate, you know, taking down any sceptical views on vaccination and so on and so forth. I thought that, OK these companies can actually grow up and, you know, take their responsibility. So I would say that for anyone who criticises me, where did you spend your years learning about these issues? I learned from the best. I would say in that sense that I know the business model. I know how they are using data. And also, if you saw my tweet earlier this week, I told literally that Meta, it was a huge mistake, what they’re doing now in the US.  Murad Ahmed Everything you said, Aura, you know, it’s a great kind of story, but it seems to have been exploded in recent times. So Nick Clegg, whom you mentioned, who was a former deputy prime minister of the UK, went to be the head of policy at Meta. He’s now out of the company. We have Joel Kaplan in his place, who has deep links with the US Republican party. Mark Zuckerberg has gone and said he’s dismantling all the fact-checkers that they’ve built to check facts. He said that the Biden administration went so far to try and censor content and they bowed to it. And he regrets the things that you were saying, things like the vaccine information at Meta platforms. Surely this isn’t a big mistake. It sounds like this is where their position always was. It doesn’t come across to me that either Mark Zuckerberg or Meta, formerly Facebook, has ever been very strong on privacy and it’s constantly saying what it needs to say to avoid regulation.  Aura Salla I was just calling to tell you that the story continues. And indeed, when Nick Clegg left, when the news hit, I thought, OK, now this is going to a wrong direction. And I think it was a huge mistake of giving up these fact-checkers. OK, now in the US. But I believe that we will see the same thing happening in the EU. And this worries me a lot because some people say that, OK, third-party fact-checkers, it’s going against freedom of speech. There is some censorship. I disagree with this. The thing is that people don’t even realise what kind of stuff people are putting out there if there is nothing holding them back. And it’s not only people. You have so many anonymous troll fake accounts and they are machinating this propaganda. And this is something that is super harmful for democracy. So for me, this is really a red line where the companies going right now. And it goes against what I believe. But I’m back in politics, of course. So I got elected, then to the Finnish parliament and now to the European parliament. And I think that the EU, yes, overregulated the market for its own companies to some extent, but also it’s getting things right. What comes the content moderation. And I think that we need to hold these companies accountable on that because the learning curve was there and they did the right things, but now is going backwards. And answering your next question, why are they doing this? I think it’s because of money. I think it’s because of data. The ultimate goal of these Big Tech companies is to make money, right?  Murad Ahmed I was going to ask you, I mean, you did say, you know, you went to Meta to learn how it worked. And I guess my actual next question was going to be, do you feel like the wall has been pulled over your eyes, that actually Meta or the people that you were talking to then may be well-meaning, were telling you one story, but really this isn’t what they were doing. Surely this is the real Meta. This is what they’re after. It’s money, power and as little privacy and as little regulation as possible. So even well-meaning people like yourself went out to do their bidding and may have been betrayed as a result of what’s gone on.  Aura Salla Oh, absolutely not. I’m not that naive. I always knew that their goal and aim was to make money. Absolutely not. I think the thing was that we were doing the right things and they hired people like liberals, like myself, Nick Clegg. So they knew who were they hiring because they needed us also when political field was different. In my belief, we did the right things and we hold this company also accountable. And of course, politics change. Companies change. But there is . . . I’m not that naive that I didn’t know that always the ultimate goal was to make money. Of course, collect data, develop their services, develop their products. And for Zuckerberg, as he has said now publicly time and time again, he wants to focus on metaverse. He wants to focus on AI. And what that requires is money. What that requires is data. And with this development with this company now, he can collect more data and he can make more money with Blue F, and then he can develop his services and his technology.  Murad Ahmed Well, Aura you don’t work for that Meta any more. You are a member of the European parliament now. And so to move our attention to Europe and what the EU has been doing, you know, over recent years, it passed a series of landmark tech legislation. I think the EU and the European Commission would say that those are really targets of the world’s biggest tech companies. At least that’s their intent, it seems. And 2025 looks like a year when a lot of those laws are going to start showing their teeth. You know, there are cases out there against Apple, Meta and others. So can you paint us a picture of what the next year is going to look like? What will it mean for Big Tech in Europe and tech in Europe with this kind of regulatory landscape that we see ahead?  Aura Salla Yeah, I would like to start by saying that I disagree with Anu Bradford, who has been flocking that, you know, this regulation is the best export product of the EU, that what this continent can have. I think that’s super worrying if that’s the case. I don’t think that any continent or any country will copy what we are doing in the EU. And why so? I don’t think that this regulation will hit Google, Amazon, Apple or Meta. What it will do is that we will just get like not that good services and products from these companies like we see now with Apple. They are trying to call around the Digital Markets Act the best possible way they can. They have army of lawyers and so on and so forth. So I don’t think that we will catch the Big Tech with this regulation. And also because this market area might be third or fourth important market area for them and they have a huge whole market where they can grow to be big. They are going to India, they are going to Asia, so on and so forth. What we actually caught with this regulatory tsunami, as they call it, is our own companies in Europe, that they are unable to scale, they are unable to grow to be big. And also, if they grow to be big, then welcome to the European Commission and we want to know your business plan and we want to split you because you are too big for this market. So I think we got it wrong right from the start. The aim was good as it normally is with the EU and with the commission. The aim is super good, but then the devil is in the details and now how we are enforcing these regulations. This is where I think we are going wrong.  Murad Ahmed Just one question about your critique. There’s kind of two parts to it by the sound of things. The first part is that these laws don’t work. The Big Tech companies spend a lot of time trying to get around them. Or you’re also suggesting that Europe isn’t big enough for Big Tech to care. But I mean, you worked as a lobbyist for Meta. Sorry to bring this up again. It seems like these companies spend a lot of time trying to influence the EU and these laws. Why would they if they didn’t worry about their effect? And the other thing is we have seen European laws effectively written in not maybe to the US or China, the other big markets out there, but in a lot of smaller countries, this becomes a base standard for them. We’ve seen that with the GDPR laws, have really been replicated around the world. So surely there is an effect and a global effect for this.  Aura Salla
Yeah. So but you answered your own question. I would say not in the US, not in China, not in the big markets, right? In smaller markets or smaller countries, maybe yes. But not in these biggest ones who are actually having the biggest influence in a global scale. Murad Ahmed All together, the small markets make up a considerable market, though.  Aura Salla Well, but they don’t. Hopefully, emerging markets are coming. But right now where this race is going on is in the US and in China. I remember 10 years ago Putin said that who will win the race on AI will win the globe. And that’s still the truth, right? And that’s what worries me, because the EU cannot compete against China and the US right now. And also what we see now, how Russia is doing its attacks here in the EU. We need strong tech market here. We need strong companies who can grow in their home market in the EU. So we need to enable them to scale up. We need to enable them to use data. And I’m speaking about metadata, traffic data so that they can develop their services. And this brings me to the next regulation. I’m sure that you want also talk about the AI act.  Murad Ahmed Yes.  Aura Salla Super good, right? But we need to now make sure that our own companies can actually leverage the data that we have here in the EU to develop their services, right?  Murad Ahmed
Right. Let’s get into . . .  Aura Salla So the enforcement is the key.  Murad Ahmed Aura, sorry to interrupt, but I want to get into the specifics of these laws, because some of our listeners won’t know the ins and outs of them.  Aura Salla What? Everyone has known in details of the DSA.  Murad Ahmed We’re hoping to find a bigger audience than just in Brussels. So we’ll start with the Digital Markets Act. Again, just a quick explainer on this. This is supposed to be an act that opens up digital markets and stop Big Tech groups favouring their own services. Already we’ve seen that the laws prompted Apple to allow European iPhone users — and before you interrupt me, Aura — yes, it’s only in Europe can they download apps from other stores other than Apple’s own app store. And the EU says that this law is supposed to target gatekeepers. That’s what they call them, those really big platforms with the, I mean, it’s a market cap of over €75bn, more than a million active users in the EU and an annual turnover of 7.5bn. And out of that, they’ve only found seven gatekeepers: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, ByteDance — the owner of TikTok — and Booking.com, which is the only European company on that list. Surely this is very targeted legislation focused at the top of the industry aimed to open up competition, showing signs that it is doing that. What’s the objection here?  Aura Salla
The problem is, as you said, it’s only in the EU. So these companies outside of the EU, they can grow as big as they want in other continents, right? But our own companies, Booking.com, Zalando, other European Big Tech companies, they are trying to grow big in their home market, but then they are caught by the commission when they are growing too big. How do they ever scale up at the global stage? That’s my worry. So because the law is the same for everyone, it’s not that we can catch the Big Tech with this. I think it’s actually a really good thing that we are opening markets like Apple. Yes, I think with that company, the DSA has been performing quite well. But as you said, it’s only in the EU. My worry is: how do we scale up our own companies if they cannot grow to be big in their own home market? Murad Ahmed But by the time that the size they would be caught as a gatekeeper, I mean, they’d have to be huge. Booking.com is a massive company. They can cope with the additional regulatory demands, surely?  Aura Salla Yeah, but how do they grow in global scale if these other companies can be 10 times bigger when they go outside of their home market?  Murad Ahmed I see. To move on to the Digital Services Act, I won’t go into the gory details, but this one is much more about policing information in the sense of preventing harmful content and illegal activity online. It adds additional obligations on around 20 online platforms — groups like YouTube and Facebook. Again, this is about the proliferation of content online. And surely this is again something that we need some detailed legislation to help protect consumers.  Aura Salla Absolutely. So we now talk about the DSA. I think the difficulty with the DSA, it’s the difficulty of how quickly we reach the context, for example, what comes to elections, what happened with Romania, Romanian elections. We can see that it’s not a tool that we can use in these kind of situations. It’s a tool that yes, OK, now we can analyse data after the elections, but it doesn’t protect us before something happens. And that’s a problem with the DSA. But my worry is that it’s not effective enough to protect our democracy with ongoing disinformation campaigns that we see in this continent. But of course, there is a counterargument that what kind of content we should be able to put out there on social media platforms, for example. And now, for example, a discussion around this Meta’s decision on fact-checkers. Some people say that, OK, fact-checking went too far because it created censorship. I’m not in this camp. I know what kind of content we can have on these platforms. And my worry is that these fake accounts and troll armies, they are coming back and how they are intervening our elections, it is more harmful for our democracy than this regulation. So I think the DSA and its enforcement, it is important for freedom of speech. It’s important for our democracy in the EU. And I think this is a good piece of legislation. However, it all depends now how the commission is also . . . what kind of a stance they are taking with X, for example. We all know that Musk is now part of the governance in the US, so it will be an interesting task for a commission of Europe and for example how they will now play this out with X. Will they put some sanctions or what will happen now when they are not playing by the rules in the EU?  Murad Ahmed On your point about X, what do you think? We do have a new European Commission in place. And what do you think will happen on Elon Musk and X in particular? You’re in Brussels. Do you have a sense of how they may take on or back off from Musk?  Aura Salla This will be very difficult because, of course, X is not big enough to go to the category of gatekeepers, right, because X doesn’t make any money. But also it doesn’t comply with the DSA rules right now. And how they are tweaking their algorithms, no one even knows because you need to go inside of this platform to understand them. They don’t have algorithmic transparency there. And how Musk is intervening in German elections, for example. It literally goes against the rules in the EU. But what kind of a stand the commission is ready to take, as Virkkunen said earlier this week, they might be able to sanction X, but will Musk pick up the bill? I’m not sure he will do that.  Murad Ahmed As in you think he’ll just ignore the EU?  Aura Salla To be honest, I don’t think that he will play by the rules, even if the commission is forcing him. And then they don’t literally have much what they can do if they don’t pay these sanctions. For these other companies, let’s say for Google, I think for them it’s a PR case to play by the rules and respect the EU regulation. It is because they have huge business here. Meta has OK business here, but I think I would claim that Google has big business here. Same with Microsoft, Amazon, even Apple, I’d say, this is a big market area for them. So for Meta, for X, I’d say of course it’s a big market area, but it’s also about collecting data. As you know, it’s basically data is the new gold or platinum even, so you can make your services better. But for Microsoft and Google, Amazon, it’s a little bit different thing because they also make money here. So I’d say for them respecting these rules, it’s important. And even though Apple is going around a bit, but other companies, they are respecting these rules. But for Musk, what does he have to lose here? So this will be difficult for the commission, definitely.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  Murad Ahmed You mentioned perhaps the most controversial piece of new legislation that’s coming in is the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act. This is probably the toughest regime on the planet on regulating AI, and its original aim seemed to be to prevent some of the more manipulative uses of AI, such as banning facial recognition systems en masse in public places. But would the development of new AI models from groups like OpenAI and Google, it’s also added a whole number of new burdens and regulations on so-called high-risk AI systems and models as well. What do you think about this particular law? This is one that US companies in particular have lobbied hard against and are deeply worried about.  Aura Salla I would be more worried if I were a European company. Why so? This is not . . . the enforcement of the AI Act is super messy. We have 300 pages of rules and not even the best lawyers can understand the details. And in the EU, what we are lacking of is data to train our models. We are lacking of risk capital. We are lacking of single market. We are lacking of data. And we need to do basically co-operation with the US companies to be able to compete with them one day, hopefully. And what happens with the AI Act is that it says that every member state needs to have their own regulatory sandbox. And this will fragment the market ever more. I’d say in Finland, for example, we definitely want to see the best possible regulatory sandbox, which will enable our companies to build up their new models and make sure that the commission is not sanctioning them when they are doing something. But the same thing is happening in Spain, in Portugal, in Ireland. So it will be super confusing for the companies. And the second thing is that it is very difficult to enforce. And I’m worried that the different data protection authorities will have different views on how it will be enforced in different member states.  Murad Ahmed Well, trying to put the US or Silicon Valley worldview to you as well on the AI act, I think they’re less worried about the development of European start-ups in this space as much as you’re worried about that. I have definitely heard these arguments about potential lack of competence or the complexity of these rules. But the main thing I sense is the feeling that the EU, with something like the AI act, is trying to favour its own companies. They see this as a form of protectionism to hold them back to allow Europe to catch up. You don’t think that that’s the case?  Aura Salla To be honest with the AI act? I don’t think that these companies are too worried. And I say that they have army of lawyers that could go against this. I think that they see this as a, you know, part of the cost of doing business here. That’s why I’m speaking on behalf of our scale-ups, not even start-ups, because actually these start-ups are quite protected. But it’s for the scale-ups in the EU that we need to be most worried about. I think it’s because we have such a layered regulatory environment. We have GDPR, then we have like a Data act, Data Governance act, AI act, and you need to be super aware on all of these regulations so that you are not caught, I’d say. So for these Big Tech companies, they try to navigate and think, OK, so I launch this product here or this service here. Will it cost me more or will I get more business with that? But I wouldn’t be worried about the US tech companies that they couldn’t navigate these regulations here in the EU, no matter what they say. But I am worried about our own scale-ups.  Murad Ahmed And you’ve expressed that worry well. I mean, it’s going to be a critical year ahead to see if the European start-ups particularly in AI can find a way competing against the rest, I guess the time is going to tell. One thing I’d say is that inherent inside a lot of these laws, the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act is a sanction and an ultimate sanction being the potential break-up of these Big Tech companies. Do you think that could ever happen? What do these companies need to do for a break-up to occur? Do you think the EU’s got a stomach for that level of fight?  Aura Salla This is where the EU got it wrong. The EU cannot break off Meta or Google or Amazon or Apple, right? This is . . . it’s not their whole market. If someone breaks these companies up, it’s the US government. It’s their problem, so to say, and they don’t see it as a problem. They want to have these big companies in that continent thrive. OK, we can tell these companies that they don’t function in this market area or we don’t want this and that services here in our market area because we want to protect our own companies and their growth. The problem is that the same regulation hits our own companies. And this is where I think we went wrong. So now for the next term, but I, my wish to the new commission is that please let’s not put out there, no more regulation. Let’s take a break. Let’s see the enforcement, how our companies can navigate, how they can grow and what they need. The Big Tech companies from the US, for them it’s quite clear that they need to respect these rules here. But the thing is that now for this term, the focus needs to be in our own companies here in Europe.  Murad Ahmed
And just before we get into this term and in the year ahead and the commission’s new term, going back on the break-up, is it just the EU that would be pushing for a break-up? I mean, if the actions anywhere, it’s the US. There’s an incoming Trump administration. I think it’s a little bit unclear at this stage how they feel about Big Tech, but there’s certainly sceptics within that administration. And there’s an ongoing US antitrust case against Google with a sanction that’s being discussed at the moment is a sale of its Chrome browser or even a sale of their Android mobile operating system, an unprecedented penalty. And that is where we’ve got to in laissez-faire United States, which has got plenty of capital and fewer regulations, even they can see that the power of these companies has gone too far. Surely it’s a kind of united front around the world, but the EU is very much included in, to try and stand up to this power. Aura Salla As I said, it needs to come from the US. These are US companies. We can break these companies or their services or products or whatever their business model up here in the EU. But it’s not enough. They are so big at the global scale. So as you said, yeah, in the ideal world we would team up with the US and we would break these companies. But will Musk and Trump and their administration be ready to do that? We need to see a couple of more months at least, because we don’t know what, where they are now heading to. Musk is maybe buying now TikTok next. And as you can see also Zuckerberg completely changed his mind all of a sudden and is now in the same camp with Trump. So I wouldn’t know how to predict the future right now with the US. We need to see first where this new administration is heading to. But I wouldn’t hold my breath that they will team up with the EU and start splitting big companies that would also hit Musk and Tesla and so on and so forth. So let’s see. But I wouldn’t say that we are in that path right now.  Murad Ahmed I will ask you to look into your crystal ball a little bit to see what the future looks like. But I’ll ask you what the future looks like in the EU. We do have a new commission. What do you think they will do? Do you think it’s a commission that’s closer to your worldview, which is let’s take a pause in regulation. Let’s see how the existing ones operate and think about the home market. Or do you think they’ll press forward?  Aura Salla Definitely they will press forward. I really hope they would be in my camp, but they will not be. Because, you know, when a politician takes an office, what happens is that, you know, you want to leave your stamp to the history, right? And it’s not going to happen by deregulation. It’s going to happen with the regulation. And you want to see Lex Virkkunen or you want to see Lex von der Leyen. And when you are looking at those mission letters that they wrote to the commissioners, you can see that there already are signs that we will have more regulation, we will see more financial instruments again. And I think that the Digital Fairness Act is something that will now be cooking. And I think that they will add up their everything that was left out from the DSA or other regulations. I think there will be something coming around privacy, around data, maybe disinformation. Publishers are definitely not happy in the EU still. So I would say that’s my biggest worry now — that they will keep going and keep regulating ever more.  Murad Ahmed Well, let’s see how much of an effect you have in the coming year. I’m sure you’ll be a vocal, if perhaps relatively lonely voice out there in Brussels. Aura Salla, thank you for your time.  Aura Salla Thank you so much.

",2025-02-03,This is an audio transcript of the Tech Tonic podcast episode,"In the Tech Tonic podcast episode titled ""Tech in 2025 — The EU vs Big Tech,"" host Murad Ahmed discusses the complex relationship between the European Union (EU) and major technology companies, known as Big Tech. The EU has positioned itself as a global regulator of Big Tech, focusing on issues like online privacy and artificial intelligence (AI) regulation. Notably, it has imposed heavy fines on companies like Apple and Meta.

Aura Salla, a former lobbyist for Meta and current member of the European Parliament, voices skepticism about the effectiveness of EU regulations. She argues that large tech firms can easily navigate these laws with their legal resources, while smaller European companies struggle under the increased regulatory burden. Salla believes that the regulations may not achieve their intended goals, like encouraging competition, and might even hinder the growth of local European tech firms.

Throughout the conversation, they explore the implications of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA), which aim to open markets and regulate harmful online content, but Salla fears they could restrict local innovation. The discussion also touches on the upcoming AI Act, which she predicts could overwhelm smaller companies due to its complexity.

Salla expresses doubt on whether the EU can effectively break up large tech companies since they are primarily US-based. The podcast concludes with concerns that the EU will continue to pursue stricter regulations, potentially stifling its own tech ecosystem instead of fostering growth."

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Robert Armstrong
The American president, Donald Trump, says he really, really means it this time on tariffs. You are listening to Unhedged, the markets and finance podcast from the Financial Times and Pushkin. I am Rob Armstrong, coming to you from Unhedged headquarters in beautiful New York City, joined by Aiden Reiter.

Aiden Reiter
Hello.

Robert Armstrong
Aiden, can we believe what this guy says about tariffs? He said just this morning he would impose another 10 per cent tariff on China, and that his threatened levies on Mexico and Canada would go through next week. And yesterday he said he would slap a 25 per cent tariff on imports from Europe, on the grounds that the European Union was created in order to screw the United States. I feel like he says something different every day. So far, only the aluminium and steel tariffs have happened. And if I might wax Shakespearean, there’s been a lot of sound and fury on tariffs but not a lot of signification. Not a lot has happened. Do we believe him this time?

Aiden Reiter
Well, I believe him on China. So he did hit China with 10 per cent tariffs last time around in addition to the 25 per cent on aluminium. So if you look at the economic advisers in his orbit, most of them have no interest in negotiating with China, at least judging on their past beliefs and their past writings. So I believe China will go through.

Canada and Mexico, who knows? He surprised everybody when he said he would do it on the first day of his presidency. And then since then, he called it off at the 12th hour, you know. Who knows?

Robert Armstrong
Yeah. Those relationships are so economically important to us that it seems like maybe he knows he’s playing with fire. He hits them hard with tariffs.

Aiden Reiter
You know, we’ve gotten some negative economic sentiment and, you know, some potential of negative economic growth. Hitting Canada and Mexico probably has an outsized impact versus hitting China or Europe. So he might feel like he has less room to actually go ahead with those.

Robert Armstrong
Europe is the big one, right? This is an important . . . And for us, of course, we’re a European newspaper coming from the UK; Europe, of course, in the broad sense, not in the narrow sense of the European Union. And we haven’t seen that strong a reaction to all of this news and to the Europe news in particular. Of course, what we monitor when we are trying to determine if the market believes Trump is the buck. The theory is tariffs mean a higher dollar because they decrease American demand for foreign currencies — we’re buying less stuff — and they increase foreign demand for the dollar because you got to pay the tariffs in dollars.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. And also theoretically if they raise inflation, rates stay up higher for longer. That makes the dollar stronger. Yeah.

Robert Armstrong
Stronger once again. Indeed. So. But the dollar moved a little bit today. It’s a little stronger today, but not loads. It’s still in the same trading range.

Aiden Reiter
And it’s been coming off for the past couple of days.

Robert Armstrong
Couple of weeks, even.

Aiden Reiter
Couple of weeks.

Robert Armstrong
And so the market, I think, is ambiguous. And one interesting aspect of this that I wanted to get into is that European stocks are doing pretty good this year.

Aiden Reiter
They’ve had a good run.

Robert Armstrong
Yeah. So they are outperforming US stocks by something like 8 or 10 percentage points.

Aiden Reiter
Since January 1st.

Robert Armstrong
Since January 1st they’ve been on a good run. The biggest companies in Europe, from ASML to Nestlé to SAP to LVMH, they’ve all had a good start to the year and indeed, all the whole wide European index has done well. And this is a remarkable change.

Aiden Reiter
Is that because, you know, right now we’ve seen the Mag Seven essentially flat and value is doing well. Other people have argued Europe is more value. Is that what’s going on?

Robert Armstrong
Yeah. This is the traditional rap on Europe, that its stock markets are full of companies in sectors that just haven’t done well in recent years anywhere. So it’s like banks and miners; basically value stocks, industrials. Whereas the American stock market is like Big Tech companies, growth companies, growth retail companies, etc. And so Europe has been lagging for like 15 years now. Is that starting to reverse? Possibly. I mean, the biggest change in stock markets is I think we have discussed here on the show in recent weeks is that the Mag Seven are not mag.

Aiden Reiter
Flat to down.

Robert Armstrong
Yes. They are the Sad Seven.

Aiden Reiter
My stock pick to short Google is looking a little smart right now.

Robert Armstrong
And my long is looking terrible. And so part of the difference, part of Europe’s big comeback is just America’s stock market is no longer being dragged along by these seven enormous tech companies. I also wonder if the kind of general American exceptionalism trade could only go so far. American stocks broadly, Magnificent Seven aside, just got so expensive relative to Europe that at some point you had to see some mean reversion. And then you throw in not knowing what on earth American fiscal policy is going to be. And that sort of makes the mean reversion happen. It says, people, well, maybe Europe doesn’t look so bad all of a sudden.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. I mean, we’ve argued in the newsletter, right? Maybe Europe is overly cheap. It gives you cheap exposure to the US. We found that to be not so true. It’s not like Europe is absolutely cheap in relative terms, the growth you’re getting there. But, again, if the US is so expensive, it makes sense to buy it.

Robert Armstrong
I did a little work yesterday and it’s interesting that over the last couple of years, underneath the surface, European stocks have been making a comeback. So while the headline index in the United States continues to outperform the headline index in Europe, in certain sectors, Europe has been making its comeback — industrials, financials, materials, kind of stuff like this. And it’s just in those tech sectors that America for the last couple of years is outperforming. That’s not true by the way over the long run. Over the long run, meaning 15 years, US has been winning everywhere.

One question I have, Aiden, is whether what we are seeing is at least a tentative recognition by the market that the gap in economic growth between Europe and the US is not as great as we once thought. So if you’d asked us like three months ago why do these two stock markets act so differently, why do the bonds and the currencies of these countries act so differently, it would be very clear: Europe was on the edge of recession and America was booming. And now there’s a little wobbliness, as you mentioned, especially in sentiment in the US and in some of the hard data too. And maybe Europe is not quite as bad off as we thought before. Do you think that’s possible?

Aiden Reiter
I mean, I don’t think the picture of economic growth in Europe has actually changed that much in the last month.

Robert Armstrong
Yeah. That’s probably right.

Aiden Reiter
Right? Like, not too much has changed. They are still struggling with a lot of the same issues. They still don’t have, you know, market integration, as Mario Draghi has constantly harangued them to do, right? They still have the same major headwinds against them — population decline, etc. I think the only thing that’s really changing on the European continent, besides things happening across the Atlantic, is the Ukraine war might come to something of an end. Who knows? So, you know, Donald Trump . . . 

Robert Armstrong
Right. People can see it.

Aiden Reiter
People can see it. It’s not a way Europe would have chosen to end, right? It’s not a good picture. But there are some stocks within Europe that have definitely responded well to that news. So the defence stocks which we wrote about this week. So the US has a massive military-industrial complex with big, great companies in the defence space.

Robert Armstrong
Lockheed, General Dynamics.

Aiden Reiter
Northrop Grumman, RTX — which was UTX and . . . United Technologies and Raytheon merged. Europe has some good ones, but nowhere nearly as big as the US.

Robert Armstrong
Yes. It’s like half the size of the or less the size of the US industry.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. I think last quarter, like the top four European defence companies had a third of the revenue of the top four US companies. So anyway, but there are some really good companies in Europe.

Robert Armstrong
And they’ve been jamming.

Aiden Reiter
And they’ve been jamming. So since 2022, when the Ukraine war started, the three biggest defence companies in Europe — Leonardo, the Italian company; Thales . . . 

Robert Armstrong
I don’t know. (Laughter)

Aiden Reiter
Thales, the French company . . . Probably that. Yeah, that sounds right. I’m just into Duolingo on French. So Thales from France and BAE in the UK have all had amazing runs, specifically Leonardo.

Robert Armstrong
And this makes sense, in a way. We have a war in Europe. Obviously, that’s good for European arms manufacturers right out of the gate. And then more recently, you have the United States say to Europe, you guys, from a security point of view, are on your own now. The US defence umbrella is being folded up and put into the closet. You are gonna have to spend a lot more of GDP on defence. And of course the European response to that as well: if we have to do that, we’re not gonna spend it at your companies. We’re gonna spend it at our companies. So it looks like this is kind of an obvious trade.

Aiden Reiter
Exactly, exactly. Yeah. So right in the middle of this month, JD Vance was in Munich and Pete Hegseth, the new secretary of defence, was in Europe and he said, we’re pulling our troops out of Poland. You guys have to not only increase it to the Nato threshold of 2 per cent, you need to go up above that.

Robert Armstrong
You’re talking military spending as a per cent of GDP.

Aiden Reiter
Military spending as a percentage of GDP. So now it’s looked like, you know, it was looking like they were gonna get north of 2 per cent soon. Now they’re targeting even higher. And then on top of that, the US doesn’t even seem like a reliable ally any more now that Trump is debating with Putin. So of course, as you said, they wanna spend on their own companies. So since the middle of the month, all the five biggest US defence stocks are flat down where all five of the European ones are up.

Robert Armstrong
And the other piece of context, of course, is that Doge is coming for the Pentagon eventually, right? Or not even eventually. It’s happening now. They’re talking about basically cutting that budget.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah, they definitely want to cut that budget. It’s unclear how that’s gonna flow through to armament, right? Like they might just try to cut all the contractors and smaller pieces. Not the actual military because, you know, there is a very strong lobby in the United States government.

Robert Armstrong
Yes. I learnt something about that.

Aiden Reiter
Covering the military-industrial complex. Also, you know, they’re focused on quote unquote, lethality. I don’t think you’d want to get rid of our weapons if you want to be more lethal.

Robert Armstrong
Yes. But investors are not waiting around so much to hear about the niceties of this. They are saying, let me sell something, and the big defence companies are what they are selling.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. And on top of that, right, for the past couple of years, the US, specifically the Joe Biden administration, has worked really hard to help Europe to arm Ukraine. And one of the ways they did that, as we spoke with some experts, is they would essentially say, hey, Europe, we’re gonna buy your old system if you give it to Ukraine and then...

Robert Armstrong
Your weapons system.

Aiden Reiter
Your old weapons system. Essentially, we’re giving you the money to do this, and now we’re giving you the money to buy our newest weapons system, right? So you get something great, Ukraine gets something great, and we’ll help foot the bill. That’s not happening any more.

Robert Armstrong
Right. And what that means is the bill is being footed by Europe. And in theory, what we’re speculating here is that the bill comes from a Thales, a Leonardo.

Aiden Reiter
Or bill goes to a Thales, a Leonardo. They’re paying their own companies as opposed to us getting them to pay our companies.

Robert Armstrong
Fair enough.

Aiden Reiter
Europe is not gonna completely go off of US armaments, right? They still have to build up their defence and tactical base.

Robert Armstrong
I would think it was impossible to really go cold turkey from US defence companies.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. I mean what US has right now, according to the experts we spoke with, is a lot of off-the-shelf supplies ready to go. Europe has time. They need to build over the next couple of years their own defence industrial capacity. Some of the biggest countries in Europe with the biggest armies actually don’t get so much of their imports from the US. They do. It’s more of like 10-15 per cent.

Robert Armstrong
So it’s like Germany, France, the UK.

Aiden Reiter
Germany, France, UK, Poland. They are less reliant on the US. It’s more the smaller countries in Europe. The idea is now these companies are gonna build up more, they get more government support and fill the void for the smaller companies.

Robert Armstrong
Yeah, countries.

Aiden Reiter
Countries, yes. Not companies. Smaller. You know, I don’t think the Czech Republic would love if we call them a company.

Robert Armstrong
(Laughter) But the smaller European countries will be served by the industrial base of the larger European countries.

Aiden Reiter
Yes. And there’s still going to . . . You know, the US has a huge lead in a lot of technologies. They’re still going to buy a lot of things in the US. But they’ll try to the best of their ability to replace a lot of that. And that’s not a good thing for the US, by the way. It hurts our relationship with allies. It hurts more companies. One might say this is a very short-sighted, if you were trying to actually help the US military-industrial complex.

Robert Armstrong
(Laughter) Aiden, you have achieved something that I thought was impossible. You have made me feel bad for the US military-industrial complex.

Aiden Reiter
Every night I go home and I just cry for Raytheon. (Robert laughs) Oh my god, I shed so many tears thinking about those poor, poor contractors.

Robert Armstrong
What this discussion makes me wonder is whether what we are seeing, and I should say, it’s extremely early days, but what we are seeing in the defence industry is a microcosm of what we might see more broadly in the world, in America’s relationship with the world — commercial relationship under a high-tariff regime.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. I mean, if you anger your allies by telling them to get lost, they’re not gonna want to buy your products. And if you slap tariffs, you’re gonna make it more expensive for them to do that to begin with. So, I mean, we’ve heard a lot from readers and listeners who’ve written to us saying we’re no longer buying US things. I mean, these are really highly engaged readers, and people who (overlapping speech) the news . . . 

Robert Armstrong
They’re FT types.

Aiden Reiter
They’re FT types who, you know, they’re more affronted by offences to globalism than most. So who knows if that’s representative. But you could imagine a lot of countries wanting to turn away from the US.

Robert Armstrong
Here’s the thing about all of this, though. I still don’t know. And this is kind of where we started the show, Aiden. It feels to me like we are at a crossroads or no, went to a fork in the road and there’s two roads ahead. One world — economics, finance, markets world — is the world in which Trump is serious about all of his tariff threats. Not just China, but Canada, Mexico, Europe, all of these allies, heavy tariffs on them. He really . . . That’s his actual destination, not just a threat. And those tariffs are coming. And then the other road is the world where it’s mostly huffing and puffing and not that much realisation of actual tariff policy.

Aiden Reiter
That world is potentially more uncertain. You kind of have the norm of what we have right now where Donald Trump is constantly threatening tariffs. We don’t know if other countries will play ball. We don’t know if it will happen. And the market and the world will just be kind of caught in the lurch between the two. You might have some real changes, right, some real concessions made by other countries, whether that be, you know, on trade balances or deals or whatever. You could have a lot of these more fake things, and that’s going to translate to a lot of uncertainty for consumers, businesses and investors.

Robert Armstrong
It’s a world where we are constantly trying to guess what an uncertain future we might have.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. If anybody’s tired from this last month, it might continue.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Robert Armstrong
(Laughter) One thing we can be certain about is that we will be right back with Long and Short.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Listeners, welcome back. This is Long and Short, that part of the show where we go long things we like and short things we don’t like. Aiden, are you long or short anything today?

Aiden Reiter
I am. I’m long the Oscars. I am very excited for the Oscars.

Robert Armstrong
Come on!

Aiden Reiter
Awarding art is silly, I understand it. That being said, I really like the discourse. I really like the rankings. Also, Conan O’Brien is hosting, which I think will be really great.

Robert Armstrong
Right on. I’m gonna go out on a limb after the discussion we just had and I’m gonna go long the dollar. I think that the tariffs, my gut — and I’m not saying I can make a very coherent argument for this — my gut is that Trump will not want to be seen to back down and he will put the tariffs on and the dollar will return to its highs.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Aiden Reiter
Or you just want more spending power when you go on international vacations. Coming up.

Robert Armstrong
It’s true. That is another thing that I want here. (Aiden laughs) Listeners, we will be back in your feed next week. Until then, stay sharp out there.

Lockheed, General Dynamics. Aiden Reiter
Northrop Grumman, RTX — which was UTX and . . . United Technologies and Raytheon merged. Europe has some good ones, but nowhere nearly as big as the US. Robert Armstrong
Yes. It’s like half the size of the or less the size of the US industry. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. I think last quarter, like the top four European defence companies had a third of the revenue of the top four US companies. So anyway, but there are some really good companies in Europe. Robert Armstrong
And they’ve been jamming. Aiden Reiter
And they’ve been jamming. So since 2022, when the Ukraine war started, the three biggest defence companies in Europe — Leonardo, the Italian company; Thales . . .  Robert Armstrong
I don’t know. (Laughter) Aiden Reiter
Thales, the French company . . . Probably that. Yeah, that sounds right. I’m just into Duolingo on French. So Thales from France and BAE in the UK have all had amazing runs, specifically Leonardo. Robert Armstrong
And this makes sense, in a way. We have a war in Europe. Obviously, that’s good for European arms manufacturers right out of the gate. And then more recently, you have the United States say to Europe, you guys, from a security point of view, are on your own now. The US defence umbrella is being folded up and put into the closet. You are gonna have to spend a lot more of GDP on defence. And of course the European response to that as well: if we have to do that, we’re not gonna spend it at your companies. We’re gonna spend it at our companies. So it looks like this is kind of an obvious trade. Aiden Reiter
Exactly, exactly. Yeah. So right in the middle of this month, JD Vance was in Munich and Pete Hegseth, the new secretary of defence, was in Europe and he said, we’re pulling our troops out of Poland. You guys have to not only increase it to the Nato threshold of 2 per cent, you need to go up above that. Robert Armstrong
You’re talking military spending as a per cent of GDP. Aiden Reiter
Military spending as a percentage of GDP. So now it’s looked like, you know, it was looking like they were gonna get north of 2 per cent soon. Now they’re targeting even higher. And then on top of that, the US doesn’t even seem like a reliable ally any more now that Trump is debating with Putin. So of course, as you said, they wanna spend on their own companies. So since the middle of the month, all the five biggest US defence stocks are flat down where all five of the European ones are up. Robert Armstrong
And the other piece of context, of course, is that Doge is coming for the Pentagon eventually, right? Or not even eventually. It’s happening now. They’re talking about basically cutting that budget. Aiden Reiter
Yeah, they definitely want to cut that budget. It’s unclear how that’s gonna flow through to armament, right? Like they might just try to cut all the contractors and smaller pieces. Not the actual military because, you know, there is a very strong lobby in the United States government. Robert Armstrong
Yes. I learnt something about that. Aiden Reiter
Covering the military-industrial complex. Also, you know, they’re focused on quote unquote, lethality. I don’t think you’d want to get rid of our weapons if you want to be more lethal. Robert Armstrong
Yes. But investors are not waiting around so much to hear about the niceties of this. They are saying, let me sell something, and the big defence companies are what they are selling. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. And on top of that, right, for the past couple of years, the US, specifically the Joe Biden administration, has worked really hard to help Europe to arm Ukraine. And one of the ways they did that, as we spoke with some experts, is they would essentially say, hey, Europe, we’re gonna buy your old system if you give it to Ukraine and then... Robert Armstrong
Your weapons system. Aiden Reiter
Your old weapons system. Essentially, we’re giving you the money to do this, and now we’re giving you the money to buy our newest weapons system, right? So you get something great, Ukraine gets something great, and we’ll help foot the bill. That’s not happening any more. Robert Armstrong
Right. And what that means is the bill is being footed by Europe. And in theory, what we’re speculating here is that the bill comes from a Thales, a Leonardo. Aiden Reiter
Or bill goes to a Thales, a Leonardo. They’re paying their own companies as opposed to us getting them to pay our companies. Robert Armstrong
Fair enough. Aiden Reiter
Europe is not gonna completely go off of US armaments, right? They still have to build up their defence and tactical base. Robert Armstrong
I would think it was impossible to really go cold turkey from US defence companies. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. I mean what US has right now, according to the experts we spoke with, is a lot of off-the-shelf supplies ready to go. Europe has time. They need to build over the next couple of years their own defence industrial capacity. Some of the biggest countries in Europe with the biggest armies actually don’t get so much of their imports from the US. They do. It’s more of like 10-15 per cent. Robert Armstrong
So it’s like Germany, France, the UK. Aiden Reiter
Germany, France, UK, Poland. They are less reliant on the US. It’s more the smaller countries in Europe. The idea is now these companies are gonna build up more, they get more government support and fill the void for the smaller companies. Robert Armstrong
Yeah, countries. Aiden Reiter
Countries, yes. Not companies. Smaller. You know, I don’t think the Czech Republic would love if we call them a company. Robert Armstrong
(Laughter) But the smaller European countries will be served by the industrial base of the larger European countries. Aiden Reiter
Yes. And there’s still going to . . . You know, the US has a huge lead in a lot of technologies. They’re still going to buy a lot of things in the US. But they’ll try to the best of their ability to replace a lot of that. And that’s not a good thing for the US, by the way. It hurts our relationship with allies. It hurts more companies. One might say this is a very short-sighted, if you were trying to actually help the US military-industrial complex. Robert Armstrong
(Laughter) Aiden, you have achieved something that I thought was impossible. You have made me feel bad for the US military-industrial complex. Aiden Reiter
Every night I go home and I just cry for Raytheon. (Robert laughs) Oh my god, I shed so many tears thinking about those poor, poor contractors. Robert Armstrong
What this discussion makes me wonder is whether what we are seeing, and I should say, it’s extremely early days, but what we are seeing in the defence industry is a microcosm of what we might see more broadly in the world, in America’s relationship with the world — commercial relationship under a high-tariff regime. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. I mean, if you anger your allies by telling them to get lost, they’re not gonna want to buy your products. And if you slap tariffs, you’re gonna make it more expensive for them to do that to begin with. So, I mean, we’ve heard a lot from readers and listeners who’ve written to us saying we’re no longer buying US things. I mean, these are really highly engaged readers, and people who (overlapping speech) the news . . .  Robert Armstrong
They’re FT types. Aiden Reiter
They’re FT types who, you know, they’re more affronted by offences to globalism than most. So who knows if that’s representative. But you could imagine a lot of countries wanting to turn away from the US. Robert Armstrong
Here’s the thing about all of this, though. I still don’t know. And this is kind of where we started the show, Aiden. It feels to me like we are at a crossroads or no, went to a fork in the road and there’s two roads ahead. One world — economics, finance, markets world — is the world in which Trump is serious about all of his tariff threats. Not just China, but Canada, Mexico, Europe, all of these allies, heavy tariffs on them. He really . . . That’s his actual destination, not just a threat. And those tariffs are coming. And then the other road is the world where it’s mostly huffing and puffing and not that much realisation of actual tariff policy. Aiden Reiter
That world is potentially more uncertain. You kind of have the norm of what we have right now where Donald Trump is constantly threatening tariffs. We don’t know if other countries will play ball. We don’t know if it will happen. And the market and the world will just be kind of caught in the lurch between the two. You might have some real changes, right, some real concessions made by other countries, whether that be, you know, on trade balances or deals or whatever. You could have a lot of these more fake things, and that’s going to translate to a lot of uncertainty for consumers, businesses and investors. Robert Armstrong
It’s a world where we are constantly trying to guess what an uncertain future we might have. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. If anybody’s tired from this last month, it might continue. [MUSIC PLAYING] Robert Armstrong
(Laughter) One thing we can be certain about is that we will be right back with Long and Short. [MUSIC PLAYING]  Listeners, welcome back. This is Long and Short, that part of the show where we go long things we like and short things we don’t like. Aiden, are you long or short anything today? Aiden Reiter
I am. I’m long the Oscars. I am very excited for the Oscars. Robert Armstrong
Come on! Aiden Reiter
Awarding art is silly, I understand it. That being said, I really like the discourse. I really like the rankings. Also, Conan O’Brien is hosting, which I think will be really great. Robert Armstrong
Right on. I’m gonna go out on a limb after the discussion we just had and I’m gonna go long the dollar. I think that the tariffs, my gut — and I’m not saying I can make a very coherent argument for this — my gut is that Trump will not want to be seen to back down and he will put the tariffs on and the dollar will return to its highs. [MUSIC PLAYING] Aiden Reiter
Or you just want more spending power when you go on international vacations. Coming up. Robert Armstrong
It’s true. That is another thing that I want here. (Aiden laughs) Listeners, we will be back in your feed next week. Until then, stay sharp out there.

[MUSIC PLAYING]",2025-02-27,This is an audio transcript of the Unhedged podcast episode,"In a recent episode of the Unhedged podcast, hosts Robert Armstrong and Aiden Reiter discussed U.S. President Donald Trump's stance on tariffs. Trump has threatened additional tariffs on China, Mexico, Canada, and the European Union, claiming the EU was created to undermine the U.S. However, the actual implementation of these tariffs has been limited, primarily affecting aluminum and steel.

Aiden believes that tariffs on China are likely to happen due to Trump's advisors. He suggests that tariffs on Canada and Mexico might be less certain as they are crucial U.S. trading partners. The hosts noted that despite rising tariffs potentially strengthening the U.S. dollar, recent data showed the dollar's movement was minimal, and it was actually declining over the preceding weeks.

Interestingly, European stocks have outperformed U.S. stocks recently, driven by sectors like industrials and financials as opposed to the tech-heavy American market. This change indicates a potential reversal of trends where European stocks had lagged for years.

Key discussion points included the possible need for Europe to increase its defense spending, particularly in light of the ongoing Ukraine war and diminishing reliance on U.S. defense contracts. As European nations prepare to bolster their military capacities, there is speculation about a shift in defense spending towards domestic companies, which could negatively impact U.S. defense firms.

The podcast concludes with concerns about the ambiguity in tariff policies under Trump, emphasizing that ongoing uncertainty could affect markets and economic relations if tariffs are enforced or left as mere threats. The hosts expressed hope for clarity, but recognized the complexity of the situation."

Robert Armstrong
Something has changed. The air feels different. The barometer is dropping. It feels like the stars are realigning. The winds are shifting.

Aiden Reiter
Were you about to sing the Wicked intro? (Singing) Something has changed within me.

Robert Armstrong
(Laughter) As it happens, I was about to burst into song but you ruined it.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

This is Unhedged, the markets and finance podcast from the Financial Times and Pushkin. I am Rob Armstrong, chairman of the board and acting CEO of Unhedged, Inc.

Aiden Reiter
Only acting?

Robert Armstrong
(Laughter) Joined by my obstreperous chief financial officer, Aiden Reiter.

Aiden Reiter
So it sounds like what you were talking about before, Rob, was the market’s vibe shift.

Robert Armstrong
Yeah. We have had a vibe shift. Let’s talk about that for a second. What have we been seeing? What are the actual data that constitute what we’re calling a vibe shift here?

Aiden Reiter
So maybe the best indicator is we had a market drop last Friday. It was about 1.7 per cent. Nothing crazy.

Robert Armstrong
Not the end of the world.

Aiden Reiter
Not the end of the world.

Robert Armstrong
The biggest in a while.

Aiden Reiter
Biggest of all, bigger even than when we had DeepSeek. And what seems to have been the cause was a build-up of bad economic data, specifically a consumer sentiment survey that came out on Friday. It showed that, you know, the housing market is not doing great, showed that consumers are feeling really, really bad about the economy.

Robert Armstrong
Yeah. Or worse.

Aiden Reiter
Worse. Yeah. Worse than they had for a while. And that somewhat pushes against the narrative that we had of early Trump days. A lot of the 2025 outlook said this is gonna be great for growth. He’s gonna boost domestic spending.

Robert Armstrong
I would even say, you know, we had a certain amount of that in the newsletter and on the podcast. I mean, there was good reason to expect growth under Trump — deregulation, tax cuts, maybe some other stimulative fiscal activity, things of this nature.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. But those things have not happened whatsoever. Instead, we’ve just had . . . 

Robert Armstrong
We haven’t seen them yet. Yeah.

Aiden Reiter
 . . . a lot of threats about tariffs that have not really come to pass. Again, tariffs could be good for growth. They also could be bad for growth. You know, jury’s a little out. It’s definitely good for domestic stocks and domestic-focused companies like small caps, but they haven’t seen that bump.

Robert Armstrong
I’m glad you mentioned small caps because that has been a big part of the vibe shift. Small caps, which were briefly the darlings of the Trump trade, have been acting like doo-doo.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. Mid caps and small caps have just been, like, sliding down while the broader market is just flat.

Robert Armstrong
So the idea is, you know, big caps, 40 per cent of their revenue canonically comes from abroad. Small-cap and mid-cap US stocks are very domestically focused. If you’d thought America was gonna get tired of winning, you’d expect the small and mid caps to outperform the big caps. But we have seen the opposite.

Aiden Reiter
And they’re also theoretically more sensitive to economic growth within the United States for that reason. So if you have boosted growth, higher tariff walls, small and mid should do better. That hasn’t happened. The market is not saying that these things will not happen. But none of these things have happened yet.

Robert Armstrong
It’s just repricing them a little bit.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. We haven’t seen any of these policies yet. Instead, we’ve just gotten threats of tariffs. We’ve gotten some very quixotic and interesting things about the Ukraine war, which markets care about, but maybe not so much. And we haven’t really gotten anything that would make investors believe that Trump is focusing on tax cuts and focusing on deregulation. It hasn’t been the day one agenda.

Instead, on balance, we’ve only gotten things that are theoretically bad for economic growth: immigration enforcement — we’ve gotten a lot more statements on that. We’ve seen at the same time some bad economic indicators, as I said.

Robert Armstrong
Yeah. We didn’t mention another. We talked about the consumer surveys, which have been poor, but we also got ISM Services. Of course, regular listeners to the show will remember that it is the services end of the US economy that’s really been holding things up. And the ISM survey of businesses had a nasty slowdown in its last reading. We’re close to 50, meaning no longer an expansion.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah, it dipped into contraction, and it’s the first time it’s contracted in I believe four years.

Robert Armstrong
Yeah. So that was bad vibes too.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. So services, which carried up the economy, are now falling. Manufacturing went up a little bit. But if you look into what the manufacturers said, it was because of a juice-up in orders ahead of tariffs. So manufacturing is doing well. But that is not going to be long-lasting. So the economy, it looks like it’s gonna slow down. And then on top of that, if you look in the consumer sentiment survey and in the ISM, households and manufacturers and services people said they’re really concerned about what tariffs are going to do to their prices.

Robert Armstrong
Yeah. The uncertainty of it is wearing on people.

Aiden Reiter
Uncertainty. And even the manufacturers said they actually saw some supply chain price increases, especially from abroad.

Robert Armstrong
Which makes sense if you think that suppliers might be getting ready to pass price through as tariffs bite into their margins.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. And aluminium people might already be doing so because we actually already have tariffs on aluminium now.

Robert Armstrong
One specific piece of company news that we got that I think added to this unsettled feeling is Walmart, biggest employer in the country, I think still, and certainly the most important retailer, gave guidance for 2025, which was a little bit soft. A little bit softer than the growth they were looking.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. Consumers are gonna be stepping back, by their estimation.

Robert Armstrong
Yeah. So that’s not good.

Aiden Reiter
And as a result, other retail stocks also fell.

Robert Armstrong
So let’s talk about the market reaction and the place to start, although it’s never the place to finish, is the Fed. So just a few weeks ago, people were expecting two rate cuts by December of this year, by the end of the year. The policy rate is at 4.5 per cent. A few weeks ago, the futures market was looking for about a 4 per cent rate by the end of the year. Now we’re down to a little under 3.8. So basically another cut has come into the picture. And so this is suggestive of the market saying there is gonna be a little bit less growth than we thought or that’s how it looks as of now. We don’t like the recent data package. So we’re putting another rate cut into the outlook because the Fed is gonna see growth slowing and is gonna wanna juice the economy a little bit.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. And the Fed also might see some employment pressure, right? So the Fed’s dual mandate, right — rates and employment.

Robert Armstrong
Yeah. What is the employment picture?

Aiden Reiter
So we got unemployment claims data last week. It showed that people filing for unemployment ticked slightly up — not overly concerning. But that’s before we’ve seen the Doge impact play out in the labour market.

Robert Armstrong
Yeah, people . . . I’ve seen a couple of pieces about this, that people are starting to worry that enough federal workers are being fired or laid off, furloughed, etc, that this might actually start showing up in the employment numbers.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. So it’s not only the actual employees, federal employees who might be cut from this. It’s the many, many contractors the United States government hires. I saw some estimates that could be as many as 1mn workers laid off, furloughed in the next couple of months. That is about 15 per cent increase to unemployment in the United States if all those people immediately enter into the job market trying to find a job and aren’t immediately absorbed by the private sector.

Robert Armstrong
Absorbed by the private sector, yeah. And of course, there’s always a transition period when people shift sectors like that. I mean, I guess the picture up until recent weeks had been this: unemployment steady at kind of 4+ per cent, but little worries around the periphery. Not as much hiring as you’d like to see. Not firing either.

Aiden Reiter
And not quits.

Robert Armstrong
And like a very small number of quits. So what we’ve had up until now is a kind of stable but not very vibrant job market. Again, on the margin there, there is a little bit of worry. So other market responses: in January, early January, the 10-year Treasury yield, the most important price in the world, was 4.8 per cent. By fits and starts, it’s come down and it’s come down quite quickly. Lately, we’re now sitting at 4.3. What is that telling us I guess is the question. It’s consistent with lower growth.

Aiden Reiter
Lower growth and more Fed cuts as a result.

Robert Armstrong
Yes. So rates are coming in. And of course, the dollar is starting to soften a little bit too as it naturally would as US rates fall relative to the rest of the world. Mathematically, that implies the dollar has to be weaker. And again, I think we should emphasise how surprising this is. The strong dollar was like one of the core expectations for the Trump economy. And that is changing now.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. I mean it’s still strong, right? It’s still up as opposed to where it was before. And interestingly, you know, a weaker dollar might help revive the growth narrative, right? Makes US exports more attractive, but it also could depress US consumption just a little. So it sort of could help solve some of this. But at the same time, it’s not what the market expected.

Robert Armstrong
Yes. Another surprise. Now let me add another surprise to the list — US risk assets not responding to a slowdown in growth quite the way I would have thought. Yes, US big-cap stocks have been going sideways for a while, small caps have been falling a bit, but valuation multiples are still very high on stocks. And more striking still, the spreads over Treasuries of corporate bond yields have not budged a bit. So if you thought growth was really coming in, you’d start worrying about credit quality a little bit. Not happening. So it seems like we’ve talked about the kind of rates and currencies markets. There’s a very clear response — Fed expectations, bond yields, the dollar. But for me, risk assets corporate bonds and stocks are kind of eerily quiet. You might have a different read on it than I do.

Aiden Reiter
No, I think that’s right. We’ve seen equities sort of be flat. But there has been a change within that, which you wrote about yesterday. While the S&P 500 is somewhat flat and kind of riding along, there’s been a shift in what is working well and what is not working well. Defensives are up.

Robert Armstrong
Yeah. It’s true. I was seeing this morning that Campbell Soup is on a little bit of a run. And if tomato soup is doing well, I think that has to be a spooky indicator.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah, that can’t be a good sign.

Robert Armstrong
That’s comfort food, right?

Aiden Reiter
(Laughter) I feel like that’s like, raw sustenance. Like, we need to get through this winter.

Robert Armstrong
(Laughter) And here is perhaps the biggest trend in risk assets, which is the Magnificent Seven are not very magnificent. They are not riding into town to drive the bandits off and save the peasants. Basically, all of them except Meta have been behaving poorly this year. Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, Apple — so-so, but not great. And even Meta has been falling in the last week or two. So the great big-cap tech stock that was the engine of markets for years is flat to down now.

Aiden Reiter
I spoke with someone who said that well, if you look at the equal weight, right, if you don’t have this giant market cap of the Big Tech pulling everyone else down, other stocks are actually doing decently well, right? Defensives, non-Big Tech value stocks are actually doing all right. But again, that is showing the market is getting into a bit of defensive crouch.

Robert Armstrong
Yeah. It really is amazing. It’s the opposite of the market we had for the last few years where the market was weak and the Magnificent Seven carried it. Now the market is OK except for the Magnificent Seven, which is really dragging it down.

Now we come to the spookiest possibility of all. We just spoke about how yields on Treasuries are coming down. And in an environment where growth is falling, this is the most natural thing in the world. Weaker growth, investors seek safety a little bit more. They put more money in Treasuries. Bond prices go up. Yields fall. That’s all very normal. But what isn’t happening right now, which is very important, is that inflation expectations are not driving that. So the good side of slower growth in a situation like the one we’re in today where inflation is a little hotter than we would like is that a little lower growth, all else equal, should bring inflation down.

Aiden Reiter
Which is sort of the Fed’s goal of keeping rates higher for longer.

Robert Armstrong
But the 10-year break-even inflation rate is at 2.4 per cent, right at its highs where it’s been. And if you look at other cuts on the inflation expectations data, there’s mild declines, but not much.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah, they came off just a little bit on Friday, when the rest of the market seemed to absorb the slow growth narrative, but not nearly as much as some of the other changes thus far.

Robert Armstrong
Like, real yields went down. That is yields adjusted for inflation. What you’d like to see in a situation like this is nominal yields come down because inflation expectations are coming down. So again, there’s two components of the Treasury yield. There’s expected inflation and then there’s the real rate of interest. And we’ve seen the real rate of interest come down but not expected inflation, which is what we want to see fall. So that is spooky because it raises one of the scariest words in economics. What is that word, Aiden?

Aiden Reiter
Stagflation.

Robert Armstrong
So the idea, the horrible idea that starts to gnaw on the mind at moments like this is that inflation could stay high and growth could fall.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. And that puts the Fed right between the two sides of its mandate. If they have to cut in order to save the economy or save the labour market. And again, as we said before, slower growth. We’re gonna have some labour market changes in the next two months probably. Then that would cause inflation to tick up again. Or they could, you know, keep rates where they are and watch the economy crumble while inflation only comes down a bit.

So they’re always caught between the two mandates that they have. And as we said before, there is reason to believe that inflation might go up even without higher growth, right? So in the manufacturers’ surveys, in the consumer sentiment surveys, everybody seems to be very concerned or at least is starting to see the impacts of tariffs on price. And, you know, there’s some people who’ll say that’s not inflation. That’s price change, step change, yada yada. At the end of the day, the Fed is looking at the basket of goods. If the price on the basket of goods goes up, to them that’s inflation.

Robert Armstrong
Yeah. They cannot cut if inflation is where it is today. I just don’t think they can do it.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. I mean, the last inflation print we got was much hotter than people expected. It was at 3, right, ticking back up again. So again, they don’t have a room to cut. But if the economy crumbles, that’s stagflation.

Robert Armstrong
I mean, we should note here that this is one batch of data. You know, we’ve had a bunch of survey information, company reports that all sort of point in the slower growth direction. We had a bad inflation print. We see inflation expectation measures not moving down as we’d like to see. But this could be a blip. These market narratives come and go. All we can say for sure is that the last couple of weeks has had a stagflationary flavour to it, and that’s just not what you wanna see.

Aiden Reiter
No, I am too young to remember the last stagflationary event. Could you tell us, regale listeners with your experience?

Robert Armstrong
Well, I was talking with our editor Bryant about the terrible increase in the prices of comic books in the late 1970s, at the same time as allowances did not rise. Anyway, we were squeezed between buying the latest Uncanny X-Men or Daredevil.

Aiden Reiter
How could you ever choose?

Robert Armstrong
And weekly handout. It was very difficult. But again, for me, the thing that still strikes me is that we have seen poor growth data recently. Some suggestion that the poor growth might not be accompanied by lower inflation. This is all pretty bad news. Risk assets really not responding. As far as I’m concerned, there has been ups and downs, puts and takes, but credit spreads on corporate bonds and stock valuations still remain incredibly high.

And at least coming into this — and we wrote about this a little bit very recently — surveys of investor expectations, in particular institutional investors, are still very bullish. The Bank of America survey of asset managers is one of the most famous surveys. Cash levels in institutional investor portfolios near very long-term lows. Bullishness about equities, extremely high. So it’s like we’ve got this situation — bad economic data, worries about inflation tied to high valuations and high investor bullishness. It doesn’t feel like a great set-up to me.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. We should note that according to those investor surveys, bullishness did come up just a little bit around the same time, right? So investors might be starting to be hip to that even though they’re still in firmly bullish territory. And it’s also worth bearing in mind that those surveys are kind of backwards-looking, right? They only really react when investors do something about it. And they haven’t sold off just yet.

Robert Armstrong
Yeah. Investors are hanging on.

Aiden Reiter
Hanging on. And they’re hanging on for a couple arguably good reasons, right? They still might get some of the things they’re expecting from the Trump administration — deregulation, tax cuts. And also, as we said, this might be a blip in the data. We don’t know completely for sure. But we really need to wait for is the next inflation readouts that we get and the next surveys. Again, this was a flash PMI, right? The ISM survey was the preliminary. Once we get the final and once we get the next inflation print, we’ll have a better picture if stagflation is truly in the air.

Robert Armstrong
But investors are still holding out hope for now. And who are we to doubt the collective wisdom of the market?

Listeners, we will be right back with Long and Short.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Welcome back. This is Long and Short. That’s the portion of the show where we go long things we like and short things we don’t like. Aiden, do you have a long or a short for us?

Aiden Reiter
I do. I am short US defence stocks. So Trump has kind of spooked all of Europe and encouraged them to invest in their own defence. Theoretically, that might be good for US defence stocks that would then sell their goods to Europe. But nobody wants to buy US right now, especially these countries that have just been scorned by the Trump administration. So for that reason, you know, there’s been a big rally on European defence stocks and US defence stocks haven’t experienced the same jump. So for that reason, I actually think they’re gonna have more headwinds going forward, especially if the rest of the world starts arming up and they don’t want anything the US is selling.

Robert Armstrong
Man, that is a bleak outlook for Lockheed and all the rest.

Aiden Reiter
They’ll be OK.

Robert Armstrong
I am gonna be short my 53-year-old knees. I just came back from a skiing trip. I feel like the Tin Man. So I guess I’m long knee replacement.

[MUSIC PLAYING]",FEB 25 2025,Transcript,Transcript: Vibrational movements in the market,Robert Armstrong speaks to Aiden Reiter,Robert Armstrong and Aiden Reiter,Print this page,(opens in new window),"Robert Armstrong
Something has changed. The air feels different. The barometer is dropping. It feels like the stars are realigning. The winds are shifting. Aiden Reiter
Were you about to sing the Wicked intro? (Singing) Something has changed within me. Robert Armstrong (Laughter) As it happens, I was about to burst into song but you ruined it.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  This is Unhedged, the markets and finance podcast from the Financial Times and Pushkin. I am Rob Armstrong, chairman of the board and acting CEO of Unhedged, Inc. Aiden Reiter
Only acting? Robert Armstrong
(Laughter) Joined by my obstreperous chief financial officer, Aiden Reiter. Aiden Reiter
So it sounds like what you were talking about before, Rob, was the market’s vibe shift. Robert Armstrong
Yeah. We have had a vibe shift. Let’s talk about that for a second. What have we been seeing? What are the actual data that constitute what we’re calling a vibe shift here? Aiden Reiter
So maybe the best indicator is we had a market drop last Friday. It was about 1.7 per cent. Nothing crazy. Robert Armstrong
Not the end of the world. Aiden Reiter
Not the end of the world. Robert Armstrong
The biggest in a while. Aiden Reiter
Biggest of all, bigger even than when we had DeepSeek. And what seems to have been the cause was a build-up of bad economic data, specifically a consumer sentiment survey that came out on Friday. It showed that, you know, the housing market is not doing great, showed that consumers are feeling really, really bad about the economy. Robert Armstrong
Yeah. Or worse. Aiden Reiter
Worse. Yeah. Worse than they had for a while. And that somewhat pushes against the narrative that we had of early Trump days. A lot of the 2025 outlook said this is gonna be great for growth. He’s gonna boost domestic spending. Robert Armstrong
I would even say, you know, we had a certain amount of that in the newsletter and on the podcast. I mean, there was good reason to expect growth under Trump — deregulation, tax cuts, maybe some other stimulative fiscal activity, things of this nature. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. But those things have not happened whatsoever. Instead, we’ve just had . . .  Robert Armstrong
We haven’t seen them yet. Yeah. Aiden Reiter
 . . . a lot of threats about tariffs that have not really come to pass. Again, tariffs could be good for growth. They also could be bad for growth. You know, jury’s a little out. It’s definitely good for domestic stocks and domestic-focused companies like small caps, but they haven’t seen that bump. Robert Armstrong
I’m glad you mentioned small caps because that has been a big part of the vibe shift. Small caps, which were briefly the darlings of the Trump trade, have been acting like doo-doo. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. Mid caps and small caps have just been, like, sliding down while the broader market is just flat. Robert Armstrong
So the idea is, you know, big caps, 40 per cent of their revenue canonically comes from abroad. Small-cap and mid-cap US stocks are very domestically focused. If you’d thought America was gonna get tired of winning, you’d expect the small and mid caps to outperform the big caps. But we have seen the opposite. Aiden Reiter
And they’re also theoretically more sensitive to economic growth within the United States for that reason. So if you have boosted growth, higher tariff walls, small and mid should do better. That hasn’t happened. The market is not saying that these things will not happen. But none of these things have happened yet. Robert Armstrong
It’s just repricing them a little bit. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. We haven’t seen any of these policies yet. Instead, we’ve just gotten threats of tariffs. We’ve gotten some very quixotic and interesting things about the Ukraine war, which markets care about, but maybe not so much. And we haven’t really gotten anything that would make investors believe that Trump is focusing on tax cuts and focusing on deregulation. It hasn’t been the day one agenda. Instead, on balance, we’ve only gotten things that are theoretically bad for economic growth: immigration enforcement — we’ve gotten a lot more statements on that. We’ve seen at the same time some bad economic indicators, as I said. Robert Armstrong
Yeah. We didn’t mention another. We talked about the consumer surveys, which have been poor, but we also got ISM Services. Of course, regular listeners to the show will remember that it is the services end of the US economy that’s really been holding things up. And the ISM survey of businesses had a nasty slowdown in its last reading. We’re close to 50, meaning no longer an expansion. Aiden Reiter
Yeah, it dipped into contraction, and it’s the first time it’s contracted in I believe four years. Robert Armstrong
Yeah. So that was bad vibes too. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. So services, which carried up the economy, are now falling. Manufacturing went up a little bit. But if you look into what the manufacturers said, it was because of a juice-up in orders ahead of tariffs. So manufacturing is doing well. But that is not going to be long-lasting. So the economy, it looks like it’s gonna slow down. And then on top of that, if you look in the consumer sentiment survey and in the ISM, households and manufacturers and services people said they’re really concerned about what tariffs are going to do to their prices. Robert Armstrong
Yeah. The uncertainty of it is wearing on people. Aiden Reiter
Uncertainty. And even the manufacturers said they actually saw some supply chain price increases, especially from abroad. Robert Armstrong
Which makes sense if you think that suppliers might be getting ready to pass price through as tariffs bite into their margins. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. And aluminium people might already be doing so because we actually already have tariffs on aluminium now. Robert Armstrong
One specific piece of company news that we got that I think added to this unsettled feeling is Walmart, biggest employer in the country, I think still, and certainly the most important retailer, gave guidance for 2025, which was a little bit soft. A little bit softer than the growth they were looking. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. Consumers are gonna be stepping back, by their estimation. Robert Armstrong
Yeah. So that’s not good. Aiden Reiter
And as a result, other retail stocks also fell. Robert Armstrong
So let’s talk about the market reaction and the place to start, although it’s never the place to finish, is the Fed. So just a few weeks ago, people were expecting two rate cuts by December of this year, by the end of the year. The policy rate is at 4.5 per cent. A few weeks ago, the futures market was looking for about a 4 per cent rate by the end of the year. Now we’re down to a little under 3.8. So basically another cut has come into the picture. And so this is suggestive of the market saying there is gonna be a little bit less growth than we thought or that’s how it looks as of now. We don’t like the recent data package. So we’re putting another rate cut into the outlook because the Fed is gonna see growth slowing and is gonna wanna juice the economy a little bit. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. And the Fed also might see some employment pressure, right? So the Fed’s dual mandate, right — rates and employment. Robert Armstrong
Yeah. What is the employment picture? Aiden Reiter
So we got unemployment claims data last week. It showed that people filing for unemployment ticked slightly up — not overly concerning. But that’s before we’ve seen the Doge impact play out in the labour market. Robert Armstrong
Yeah, people . . . I’ve seen a couple of pieces about this, that people are starting to worry that enough federal workers are being fired or laid off, furloughed, etc, that this might actually start showing up in the employment numbers. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. So it’s not only the actual employees, federal employees who might be cut from this. It’s the many, many contractors the United States government hires. I saw some estimates that could be as many as 1mn workers laid off, furloughed in the next couple of months. That is about 15 per cent increase to unemployment in the United States if all those people immediately enter into the job market trying to find a job and aren’t immediately absorbed by the private sector. Robert Armstrong
Absorbed by the private sector, yeah. And of course, there’s always a transition period when people shift sectors like that. I mean, I guess the picture up until recent weeks had been this: unemployment steady at kind of 4+ per cent, but little worries around the periphery. Not as much hiring as you’d like to see. Not firing either. Aiden Reiter
And not quits. Robert Armstrong
And like a very small number of quits. So what we’ve had up until now is a kind of stable but not very vibrant job market. Again, on the margin there, there is a little bit of worry. So other market responses: in January, early January, the 10-year Treasury yield, the most important price in the world, was 4.8 per cent. By fits and starts, it’s come down and it’s come down quite quickly. Lately, we’re now sitting at 4.3. What is that telling us I guess is the question. It’s consistent with lower growth. Aiden Reiter
Lower growth and more Fed cuts as a result. Robert Armstrong
Yes. So rates are coming in. And of course, the dollar is starting to soften a little bit too as it naturally would as US rates fall relative to the rest of the world. Mathematically, that implies the dollar has to be weaker. And again, I think we should emphasise how surprising this is. The strong dollar was like one of the core expectations for the Trump economy. And that is changing now. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. I mean it’s still strong, right? It’s still up as opposed to where it was before. And interestingly, you know, a weaker dollar might help revive the growth narrative, right? Makes US exports more attractive, but it also could depress US consumption just a little. So it sort of could help solve some of this. But at the same time, it’s not what the market expected. Robert Armstrong
Yes. Another surprise. Now let me add another surprise to the list — US risk assets not responding to a slowdown in growth quite the way I would have thought. Yes, US big-cap stocks have been going sideways for a while, small caps have been falling a bit, but valuation multiples are still very high on stocks. And more striking still, the spreads over Treasuries of corporate bond yields have not budged a bit. So if you thought growth was really coming in, you’d start worrying about credit quality a little bit. Not happening. So it seems like we’ve talked about the kind of rates and currencies markets. There’s a very clear response — Fed expectations, bond yields, the dollar. But for me, risk assets corporate bonds and stocks are kind of eerily quiet. You might have a different read on it than I do. Aiden Reiter
No, I think that’s right. We’ve seen equities sort of be flat. But there has been a change within that, which you wrote about yesterday. While the S&P 500 is somewhat flat and kind of riding along, there’s been a shift in what is working well and what is not working well. Defensives are up. Robert Armstrong
Yeah. It’s true. I was seeing this morning that Campbell Soup is on a little bit of a run. And if tomato soup is doing well, I think that has to be a spooky indicator. Aiden Reiter
Yeah, that can’t be a good sign. Robert Armstrong
That’s comfort food, right? Aiden Reiter
(Laughter) I feel like that’s like, raw sustenance. Like, we need to get through this winter. Robert Armstrong
(Laughter) And here is perhaps the biggest trend in risk assets, which is the Magnificent Seven are not very magnificent. They are not riding into town to drive the bandits off and save the peasants. Basically, all of them except Meta have been behaving poorly this year. Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, Apple — so-so, but not great. And even Meta has been falling in the last week or two. So the great big-cap tech stock that was the engine of markets for years is flat to down now. Aiden Reiter
I spoke with someone who said that well, if you look at the equal weight, right, if you don’t have this giant market cap of the Big Tech pulling everyone else down, other stocks are actually doing decently well, right? Defensives, non-Big Tech value stocks are actually doing all right. But again, that is showing the market is getting into a bit of defensive crouch. Robert Armstrong
Yeah. It really is amazing. It’s the opposite of the market we had for the last few years where the market was weak and the Magnificent Seven carried it. Now the market is OK except for the Magnificent Seven, which is really dragging it down. Now we come to the spookiest possibility of all. We just spoke about how yields on Treasuries are coming down. And in an environment where growth is falling, this is the most natural thing in the world. Weaker growth, investors seek safety a little bit more. They put more money in Treasuries. Bond prices go up. Yields fall. That’s all very normal. But what isn’t happening right now, which is very important, is that inflation expectations are not driving that. So the good side of slower growth in a situation like the one we’re in today where inflation is a little hotter than we would like is that a little lower growth, all else equal, should bring inflation down. Aiden Reiter
Which is sort of the Fed’s goal of keeping rates higher for longer. Robert Armstrong
But the 10-year break-even inflation rate is at 2.4 per cent, right at its highs where it’s been. And if you look at other cuts on the inflation expectations data, there’s mild declines, but not much. Aiden Reiter
Yeah, they came off just a little bit on Friday, when the rest of the market seemed to absorb the slow growth narrative, but not nearly as much as some of the other changes thus far. Robert Armstrong
Like, real yields went down. That is yields adjusted for inflation. What you’d like to see in a situation like this is nominal yields come down because inflation expectations are coming down. So again, there’s two components of the Treasury yield. There’s expected inflation and then there’s the real rate of interest. And we’ve seen the real rate of interest come down but not expected inflation, which is what we want to see fall. So that is spooky because it raises one of the scariest words in economics. What is that word, Aiden? Aiden Reiter
Stagflation. Robert Armstrong
So the idea, the horrible idea that starts to gnaw on the mind at moments like this is that inflation could stay high and growth could fall. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. And that puts the Fed right between the two sides of its mandate. If they have to cut in order to save the economy or save the labour market. And again, as we said before, slower growth. We’re gonna have some labour market changes in the next two months probably. Then that would cause inflation to tick up again. Or they could, you know, keep rates where they are and watch the economy crumble while inflation only comes down a bit. So they’re always caught between the two mandates that they have. And as we said before, there is reason to believe that inflation might go up even without higher growth, right? So in the manufacturers’ surveys, in the consumer sentiment surveys, everybody seems to be very concerned or at least is starting to see the impacts of tariffs on price. And, you know, there’s some people who’ll say that’s not inflation. That’s price change, step change, yada yada. At the end of the day, the Fed is looking at the basket of goods. If the price on the basket of goods goes up, to them that’s inflation. Robert Armstrong
Yeah. They cannot cut if inflation is where it is today. I just don’t think they can do it. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. I mean, the last inflation print we got was much hotter than people expected. It was at 3, right, ticking back up again. So again, they don’t have a room to cut. But if the economy crumbles, that’s stagflation. Robert Armstrong
I mean, we should note here that this is one batch of data. You know, we’ve had a bunch of survey information, company reports that all sort of point in the slower growth direction. We had a bad inflation print. We see inflation expectation measures not moving down as we’d like to see. But this could be a blip. These market narratives come and go. All we can say for sure is that the last couple of weeks has had a stagflationary flavour to it, and that’s just not what you wanna see. Aiden Reiter
No, I am too young to remember the last stagflationary event. Could you tell us, regale listeners with your experience? Robert Armstrong
Well, I was talking with our editor Bryant about the terrible increase in the prices of comic books in the late 1970s, at the same time as allowances did not rise. Anyway, we were squeezed between buying the latest Uncanny X-Men or Daredevil. Aiden Reiter
How could you ever choose? Robert Armstrong
And weekly handout. It was very difficult. But again, for me, the thing that still strikes me is that we have seen poor growth data recently. Some suggestion that the poor growth might not be accompanied by lower inflation. This is all pretty bad news. Risk assets really not responding. As far as I’m concerned, there has been ups and downs, puts and takes, but credit spreads on corporate bonds and stock valuations still remain incredibly high. And at least coming into this — and we wrote about this a little bit very recently — surveys of investor expectations, in particular institutional investors, are still very bullish. The Bank of America survey of asset managers is one of the most famous surveys. Cash levels in institutional investor portfolios near very long-term lows. Bullishness about equities, extremely high. So it’s like we’ve got this situation — bad economic data, worries about inflation tied to high valuations and high investor bullishness. It doesn’t feel like a great set-up to me. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. We should note that according to those investor surveys, bullishness did come up just a little bit around the same time, right? So investors might be starting to be hip to that even though they’re still in firmly bullish territory. And it’s also worth bearing in mind that those surveys are kind of backwards-looking, right? They only really react when investors do something about it. And they haven’t sold off just yet. Robert Armstrong
Yeah. Investors are hanging on. Aiden Reiter
Hanging on. And they’re hanging on for a couple arguably good reasons, right? They still might get some of the things they’re expecting from the Trump administration — deregulation, tax cuts. And also, as we said, this might be a blip in the data. We don’t know completely for sure. But we really need to wait for is the next inflation readouts that we get and the next surveys. Again, this was a flash PMI, right? The ISM survey was the preliminary. Once we get the final and once we get the next inflation print, we’ll have a better picture if stagflation is truly in the air. Robert Armstrong But investors are still holding out hope for now. And who are we to doubt the collective wisdom of the market?  Listeners, we will be right back with Long and Short.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  Welcome back. This is Long and Short. That’s the portion of the show where we go long things we like and short things we don’t like. Aiden, do you have a long or a short for us? Aiden Reiter
I do. I am short US defence stocks. So Trump has kind of spooked all of Europe and encouraged them to invest in their own defence. Theoretically, that might be good for US defence stocks that would then sell their goods to Europe. But nobody wants to buy US right now, especially these countries that have just been scorned by the Trump administration. So for that reason, you know, there’s been a big rally on European defence stocks and US defence stocks haven’t experienced the same jump. So for that reason, I actually think they’re gonna have more headwinds going forward, especially if the rest of the world starts arming up and they don’t want anything the US is selling. Robert Armstrong
Man, that is a bleak outlook for Lockheed and all the rest. Aiden Reiter
They’ll be OK. Robert Armstrong I am gonna be short my 53-year-old knees. I just came back from a skiing trip. I feel like the Tin Man. So I guess I’m long knee replacement.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Aiden Reiter

[MUSIC PLAYING]",2025-02-25,This is an audio transcript of the Unhedged podcast episode,"In the latest episode of the Financial Times' ""Unhedged"" podcast, hosts Robert Armstrong and Aiden Reiter discuss recent shifts in the market, described as a ""vibe shift."" They highlight a notable market drop of about 1.7%, attributed to poor economic indicators, including consumer sentiment regarding the housing market, which suggests growing economic concerns.

The discussion reveals that expected growth under the Trump administration, driven by tax cuts and deregulation, has yet to materialize. Instead, tariffs have created uncertainty, impacting small and mid-cap stocks that typically benefit from increased domestic growth. Despite some resilience in large-cap stocks, small caps have underperformed.

The hosts express concerns about potential stagflation—a scenario where economic growth slows while inflation remains high—because inflation expectations have not decreased, even as growth outlooks dim. This situation complicates the Federal Reserve's ability to manage interest rates effectively.

Walmart's soft growth forecast added to market uneasiness, and there are rising unemployment claims that could signal further economic strain. Investors remain cautiously optimistic, holding high levels of cash but facing significant uncertainties due to mixed economic signals. Overall, the hosts conclude that the current environment is challenging, with potential risks ahead for both inflation and growth in the economy."

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Katie Martin
Where are all the shiny new companies rushing on to the stock market? Those sharp-suited bankers were convinced that 2025 was gonna be the big breakthrough year for IPOs. That’s initial public offerings or stock market listings to you and me. Pent-up demand, they said. Get ready for the rush, they said. It’s gonna be lit. Well, it’s only February but two things. First of all, it’s kind of quiet out there. And secondly, and slightly more worrying, the companies that have gone to market have been a bit meh.

Today on the show we’re asking, is there anybody out there? This is Unhedged, the markets and finance podcast from the Financial Times and Pushkin. I’m Katie Martin, a markets columnist, here at FT towers in London and therefore part of the European stock market miracle that’s kicking the US’s butt so far this year, #TeamEurope. I’m joined by not one but two of my esteemed colleagues in New York: Aiden Reiter from the Unhedged newsletter and Jenn Hughes, our US markets editor. Jenn, welcome to the show.

Jennifer Hughes
Hey there, Katie.

Katie Martin
You’ve done this before, right, so we haven’t totally put you off doing this podcast yet?

Jennifer Hughes
Not yet. But you know, this could be the one.

Katie Martin
This could be it. Aiden, if we play our cards right, we can really mess this up.

Aiden Reiter
The hazing will start soon.

Katie Martin
Jenn, you were writing about the sort of humdrum bunch of IPOs, of stock market listings that we’ve had so far this year in the newsletter the other day while we all fill in for that massive skiver, Rob Armstrong. Tell us what’s happening and what’s not happening.

Jennifer Hughes
Yeah, Rob “Vacation” Armstrong, as we like to call him around here.

Katie Martin
Vacay.

Jennifer Hughes
Absolutely. IPOs are one of my favourite topics and I say that with a straight face. You can say what you like. But this year’s been disappointing. I mean, going public, it’s a vibe thing as much as the valuation and the metrics and the number of shares and the price and all the rest of it. It’s a real vibe, a momentum thing, and the momentum has just not been there. We’ve had some big deals and they’ve just fallen flat. They are not good.

Katie Martin
A little bit of context is important here, right? So we’ve had a couple of years where the stock market has absolutely like, blown the doors off, right? We’ve had two years of 20 per cent-plus gains in the S&P 500. But the market for new listings has been like, really crap.

Jennifer Hughes
Yes. I mean, running through that quickly, 2021 was the best year on record. Not even including SPACs, especially and the blank cheque companies, not including those. Just bog standard I have a company I’d like to sell you the shares kind of public companies. 2021 was this record.

And as the stock market fell and the tax fell in 2022, that just killed the vibe, the market. So 2022 is bad for everybody. 2023, as you say, surprisingly good year for stocks — you know, bumper year. But the surprise was obviously the companies weren’t ready to go public. Plus, we all thought there was going to be a recession that year and it didn’t happen. So already-listed companies got to benefit. IPOs missed out.

2024, you think, well, recession fears have receded. This should be fine. But you’ve got the US elections. So uncertainty, volatility picks up from sort of late summer onwards. Well, frankly, you could say all year on with that one. So that kind of damped it last year. So this year, in theory, as you’ve been saying, should be their year.

Aiden Reiter
It’s all about vibes and the vibe has just been not there the past two years.

Katie Martin
Yes. And so a lot of these companies that are waiting to hit the public stock markets are already owned by private equity companies. And the narrative running into this year is that these private equity companies have ended up holding on to these portfolio companies for much longer than they normally would, much longer than they’re normally comfortable with because markets have been a bit sort of weird past few years.

And so the idea was this kind of massive kind of waiting list, this pipeline, this is what people in this kind of bit of the market always talk about — this pipeline of companies that are just itching to hit the public markets.

But there’s been a bit of a disconnect between. So the private equity firms have been saying, OK, I think this company is worth, I don’t know, say for the sake of argument, $1bn. And stock market investors have been saying we think it’s worth $500mn. And so there’s been this gap. And so the private equity companies have held on and held on and waited for the world to come around to their way of thinking.

The idea has been that this year, everyone will agree that they’ve got to come to some other understanding and agree to disagree, and maybe the private equity companies aren’t gonna get the returns they thought they were gonna get. But either way, they’re gonna have to let go of these portfolio companies this year.

Aiden Reiter
I think the other point is it’s not just private equity that is not releasing companies. Other companies that might have IPO’d faster might be holding on because there’s just more and more private capital flowing around that they can tap into, whether that be VC, private equity, so some of these start-ups don’t have to go on to the market. But Jenn, would you be able to walk us through some of the IPOs from this year that we’ve seen? Like what is the vibe of 2025?

Jennifer Hughes
Sure. And part of the point is because we’ve got private equity and so much private capital, the companies that come to market are bigger. So it’s a bigger risk. It’s not like a $500mn company. It’s a multibillion company. So whatever they do, the deals are bigger. They’ve got to find more investors, the rest of it.

We’ve had three this year, which have sort of, you know, not gone well and set an iffy tone to the whole market, I’d say. So first of all, we had Venture Global. That’s an LNG exporter, that’s liquefied natural gas to you and me. They put out a price range. They put out a price range initially and then they had to virtually halve it. That’s just not good. That says, OK, we thought we were worth 46 or something a share. We’re actually worth 23 a share.

Aiden Reiter
They did that before they actually listed. They made some big hoopla. We’re gonna be worth 46. And then when they actually came out, they had different direction.

Jennifer Hughes
Yeah. So the bankers go out with a price range and that could be raised in the US, at least; not all countries, but in the US that can be raised, lowered. And, you know, the investors are going, yeah, maybe this. I love this company, get me in. And then they’ll raise the price range. You don’t normally get a company that goes out there and starts having meetings with investors with a price range and then slashes it like that. That says you’re not in touch with reality.

Katie Martin
Yeah. You haven’t done your homework, yeah?

Jennifer Hughes
No. They’re down about a third since listing, last I looked.

Katie Martin
They cut the price at which they listed and then when they listed, the market marked the shares down even further. OK, So that’s a bit of a doozy. What else is there? What are the happy stories you have for us?

Jennifer Hughes
All right, Smithfield. This is my favourite pork producer.

Katie Martin
Everyone needs a favourite pork producer.

Jennifer Hughes
Well, they do. Smithfield is this US arm of it. It’s got a Chinese parent. And back in the day when the Chinese parent bought Smithfield, it’s about a decade-plus ago now, it was when Chinese deals were still . . . Was Chinese companies were still able to buy western ones and, you know, there was going to be some amazing synergy between a US pork producer and a Chinese one, which there isn’t.

Katie Martin
A global pork empire.

Jennifer Hughes
Well, it’s my favourite one because they tried to IPO in Hong Kong with I think it was 29 banks, which is a global record. When you see European names like Rabobank on a Hong Kong IPO, it’s funny. Basically, that deal fell apart. Twenty-nine banks couldn’t even sell this one. The only people that were rumoured to make money out of that were the Four Seasons hotel chain and Cathay Pacific, the airline.

So anyway, I like this company. I’ve, you know, kept an interest in it. But they had their price range. And they had to price below. Again, this is just not a good look. Not as bad. They were sort of like, I think the bottom of the range was 23 and they had to price at 20 a share. But they had to price below and one of the executives had to buy about 10 per cent of the deal. I think it’s traded pretty flat since. It’s just, again, it’s not a good look. It doesn’t say this company has got energy and momentum and is cool and you should have a look at it.

Aiden Reiter
It’s spoiled pork.

Jennifer Hughes
Pulled pork. You can . . . 

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. I’m kosher. I don’t eat pig. You can make up the pork joke, Katie. (Katie laughs)

Jennifer Hughes
They didn’t bring home the bacon.

Aiden Reiter
There we go.

Katie Martin
I don’t think being kosher precludes you from making decent quality pork-based jokes, Aiden.

Aiden Reiter
I just don’t have enough experience with the product. (Laughter)

Katie Martin
Up your game. What this tells you, right? You have, like, an LNG deal and liquefied national oil and natural gas deal. It doesn’t go terribly well. You have a pork deal. It doesn’t go terribly well. That tells the next company that’s thinking, I’m gonna go to market. It says, it’s gonna be dicey out there. So have there been other dicey deals as well?

Jennifer Hughes
Yes. And this one, it’s less dicey, but it hasn’t done well. So this is one of our private equity ones, SailPoint, a software company, which is bang in the market sweet spot. It’s been public before and has come on and off the market. Coming back to market, valuation was OK and demand was so strong they raised the price range. And they priced at the top of that range. Everything was going right. But this deal has got the big mo. It’s got momentum. It’s going in the right direction. The bankers even say the book is 20 times covered. I mean, that’s 20 times as many orders as there are shares. That’s really good demand. So when you have a deal like that and it prices like that, with that momentum, it should trade up on the first day, right?

Katie Martin
It should. Are you gonna tell me it didn’t?

Jennifer Hughes
SailPoint sank gently. It didn’t collapse and it didn’t do badly. It didn’t rise. A deal like that, they could say, well, it could have been worse. It could. It could have really plunged. But it didn’t go well. And IPOs should have a small opening day pop at least — you know, a little bit to say to the investors who took the time to get to know the company: hey, look, you’re in the money on day one. This is good. And it means . . . 

Katie Martin
It’s been worth your while.

Jennifer Hughes
Yeah. And other people might come along. So if you’re an investor looking at IPOs right now, it’s like, well, should I bother to meet the company or should I just wait till it goes public, wait till it falls a bit and just buy on the cheap?

Katie Martin
You know what journalists say — three’s a trend.

Aiden Reiter
So of the three, even the one that did the best, even it had a somewhat disappointing opening.

Jennifer Hughes
Yeah. Its share price has risen a bit since. That doesn’t make up for a bad first day.

Aiden Reiter
So what do we think? You know, beyond just vibes, are there other reasons that doesn’t make as much sense for companies to IPO? We’ve talked about private equity and access to private capital. Is index, you know, inclusion a part of this, right? Are small stocks being found by investors, making this worth it, or is the market just a little too broken for IPOs?

Jennifer Hughes
That I think is a bigger question. And it was interesting. Somebody emailed me after the Unhedged column went out and made this point that perhaps the amount of passive investment out there is just shrinking the pool of active managers who look at IPOs.

Katie Martin
I run home cold on this argument. There are people who will blame passive investment for anything like, you know, the milk in your fridge going off or the weather or the fact that your favourite company isn’t doing that well in the market. I think there’s some truth to it, possibly a fair amount of truth to it, but I’m just not convinced.

But I was talking to a banker who does this sort of stuff for a living the other day, someone who like, brings new companies to market. And he was saying the big problem at the moment is, and we know this only too well with people who try and write about markets for a living, is that they are all over the bloody shop. And the minute you think you know what’s going on, some kind of pronouncement comes out of the White House that turns it on its head. And there’s quite a lot of volatility that ends up not necessarily going anywhere, but just kind of creating quite a lot of churn in the market.

Jennifer Hughes
Yeah. It’s not reflected in the Vix, but it’s there. Yeah.

Katie Martin
Yeah. It’s not necessarily reflected in the Vix index, which is a way of measuring how volatile the market is or how volatile investors think the market’s going to be. But what that does is if you’re a company and you want to have the sort of listing where it hits the market and then it goes up 10 per cent in the first day and all of your early public investors are really happy and everyone’s smiling and your name is golden and all the newspapers and the financial TV writes about how fantastically this new stock is going. You wanna be like that guy. You don’t wanna be the guy that’s like, look at this absolute turkey of a stock that has been a disaster.

So it just makes that kind of conversation that a company has with its bankers around when to hit the market that bit more complicated when you have got that level of volatility where your stock can do badly on the first day or the first week for reasons that are nothing to do with you and everything to do with just random market volatility. So the volatility in itself really doesn’t help here.

Jennifer Hughes
No. I mean, there’s been this rise in people putting money in way-out-of-the-money puts on the S&P because they want some disaster protection.

Katie Martin
What does that mean, for the uninitiated?

Jennifer Hughes
That basically means a form of insurance against the market absolutely falling out of bed because of something that’s happened. Could be something that Donald Trump says, could be something else. So people are thinking, at the moment we’re bobbling along. We’re taking all these announcements and pronouncements with a grain of salt and waiting for the details. But what if tomorrow it does fall out of bed? So yeah, there is this sense of uncertainty. And if you’re a company and you start the process, it looks bad if you stop before you get there because the market tanks. So you’re right, people are going to be careful about pulling the trigger.

Aiden Reiter
One piece of this puzzle that we haven’t talked about is regulation. Jenn, I liked in your piece you quoted the founder of Robinhood, who talked about a new type of IPO. Could you speak a little bit about that?

Jennifer Hughes
Yes, from Vlad Tenev. He had a column in the Washington Post last month where he was talking about the benefits of tokenisation, which is, look, I’m not particularly a fan at this point. I think it sounds like the benefits of blockchain and all the rest of it.

Aiden Reiter
Sorry. About tokenisation you mean listing something on blockchain?

Jennifer Hughes
Yes. Creating tokens in it. The idea being that we could have a smoother path to a company becoming public. It could give normal investors access to companies that are private. Personally, I call that an initial public offering still. I don’t think it needs to have a different process.

Katie Martin
So Tenev from Robinhood, which UK listeners might know or European listeners might not be aware that it’s a retail brokerage, effectively. It’s a really popular way for retail investors in the States to access the stock market. So he’s saying what, that you should create kind of crypto coin-type equivalents of companies that are traded off of normal stock exchanges. Is that the idea?

Jennifer Hughes
Yeah. So it could be after or before a public offering that you tokenise this, effectively create an electronic record. And so it might be easier to get investors into private companies, that kind of thing.

Aiden Reiter
So it is an IPO by another name.

Jennifer Hughes
More or less.

Katie Martin
I’m just gonna put it out there that I think this is a crap idea. Like, if you’re gonna create like a tradable token that relates to a company, that’s a share. That’s the stock market. Congratulations. You’ve invented the stock market, but without any regulations to keep the consumers safe.

Jennifer Hughes
Well, that would keep a lot of people happy, the no regulations bit at least.

Katie Martin
I’m just again gonna say that generally speaking, when you take regulations off financial markets, bad things happen and normal members of the public and taxpayers end up footing the bill like eight to 10 years later. So again, just putting out there. Personally, I think it’s a crap idea.

Jennifer Hughes
Well, when I asked people what regulation was a real problem, the two things that keep coming up or kept coming up were Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank. Now, Sarbanes-Oxley followed the Enron scandal, the accounting scandals of that period, the early 2000s. And Dodd-Frank came after the global financial crisis. So basically . . .

Aiden Reiter
Those are regulations, you know, laws that required markets to or, you know, investors to abide by certain laws. Is that right?

Jennifer Hughes
They did. I mean, they are burdens on companies, sure, because, you know, you had to do things like sign off your accounts now, disclose your executive compensation policies and other such fun stuff. But yeah, these were reactions to massive disasters in the market.

Katie Martin
It’s a bit like, you know, if you are close to a building site and there’ll be like a big sign outside it that says you got to wear a helmet. And you got to wear a hard-hat and you got to wear boots and you gotta wear a high-vis jacket and you can only enter the site if you’re registered. All of those regulations exist because some poor sod got killed by not following that rule. Do you know what I mean? Like health and safety rules are not there for just no reason. And it’s the same with markets rules. They’re there to stop people getting defrauded and stop terrible things happening. So call me old-fashioned and I will no doubt get emails from my usual correspondents. Hi, I’m Team Regulation, personally.

So look, one last thing just to wrap up on here, going back to the IPOs. And actually, I did a podcast with Craig Coben, who used to do this sort of stuff for a living when he was a banker, around Christmastime. So, you know, scroll back and listen to that if you want some more on how IPOs work and all that sort of thing. But like to your mind, Jenn, who cares? Like, what does it matter if we get new companies in the stock market? Bankers get lovely bonuses out of it. Who else cares?

Jennifer Hughes
I think, you know, Team Small Investor over here. But definitely we care because we want more companies to go public. We want companies that you and I can invest in. Our pensions will go into that kind of thing. So you need those companies to go public. Otherwise private companies can tell you what value they want. It’s not the scrutiny. I mean, one of the pushbacks I got . . . What of FTX, the Sam Bankman-Fried crypto exchange? What if that had been public? Do you think it would have had the same problems?

Katie Martin
A good point.

Jennifer Hughes
Quite a lot can be said for public companies and scrutiny.

Katie Martin
Aiden, do you care?

Aiden Reiter
I care. I agree with Jenn. We wanna be able to see into these companies. Also, you know, if you wanna have a good market, you need new innovative companies coming in, right? What if Nvidia had not listed a couple of years ago? The people who owned those shares would not be, you know, gazillionaires now. And isn’t that a great part of capitalism, that you can make these bets? Like, I’m all for markets working and I’m all for people being able to take their shots and small companies that pay off.

Katie Martin
So we’re pro markets, but we’re not pro chaos.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

I am also pro going to Long/Short.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Alrighty. It’s time for Long/Short, that part of the show where we go long a thing we love or short a thing we hate. Aiden, do you have a long or a short?

Aiden Reiter
Yeah, I do. I am short the idea of monetising the US balance sheet. This is something that Scott Bessent said they would do in order to make a sovereign wealth fund.

Katie Martin
He’s the Treasury secretary.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. The US Treasury secretary said they would monetise the US’s balance sheet. If you look at the US’s balance sheet, most of the money is, you know, loans that are not particularly profitable, right? So student loans, other loans that you couldn’t easily sell off and the rest is property, plants and equipment. I don’t think we should be, you know, renting out the left nostril of George Washington on Mount Rushmore. So I don’t really know how they’re gonna monetise these assets unless there’s other cost savings they’re gonna find. So I’ve been short the idea of it. I think it’s very silly.

Katie Martin
OK. Fair enough. Maybe in contrast, I am long the unexpected. So US foreign policy gone totally on its head. Domestic checks and balances in the States gone completely out the window. And yet markets are like, bobbing along. La la la la la. I’m sure nothing crazy will happen here. I’m just not so sure. I’m just saying watch out for highly unorthodox policy in financial markets because you just never know. Jenn, have you thought of anything yet?

Jennifer Hughes
So I’m gonna go long, or at least a little bit long. I’m a journalist. Give me some caution here still. I go a little bit long the 10-year US Treasury. So this week, Bessent, Treasury secretary, as we said, came out and said he wasn’t going to alter in any quick sense the make-up of sort of the US Treasury borrowing schedule. This is actually quite a big deal for him because this is a guy that before Trump was elected was bashing the Treasury for having done all these short- term bills and not turning out enough debt. So it’s been costing the US money. He gets into power and he says, OK, we’ll stick with a system I was criticising. He says it’s part dependent, so it might change over time, but for now it means we’re not gonna see this flood of 10-year Treasuries, which is probably good for most investors and certainly probably the Treasury balance sheet.

Katie Martin
So you’re saying if it was up to you, you’d be buying a little bit of that 10-year bond from Uncle Sam?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Jennifer Hughes
Yes, just a little bit.

Katie Martin
Just a little bit.

Jennifer Hughes
The hedgesurance.

Katie Martin

Where are all the shiny new companies rushing on to the stock market? Those sharp-suited bankers were convinced that 2025 was gonna be the big breakthrough year for IPOs. That’s initial public offerings or stock market listings to you and me. Pent-up demand, they said. Get ready for the rush, they said. It’s gonna be lit. Well, it’s only February but two things. First of all, it’s kind of quiet out there. And secondly, and slightly more worrying, the companies that have gone to market have been a bit meh. Today on the show we’re asking, is there anybody out there? This is Unhedged, the markets and finance podcast from the Financial Times and Pushkin. I’m Katie Martin, a markets columnist, here at FT towers in London and therefore part of the European stock market miracle that’s kicking the US’s butt so far this year, #TeamEurope. I’m joined by not one but two of my esteemed colleagues in New York: Aiden Reiter from the Unhedged newsletter and Jenn Hughes, our US markets editor. Jenn, welcome to the show. Jennifer Hughes
Hey there, Katie. Katie Martin
You’ve done this before, right, so we haven’t totally put you off doing this podcast yet? Jennifer Hughes
Not yet. But you know, this could be the one. Katie Martin
This could be it. Aiden, if we play our cards right, we can really mess this up. Aiden Reiter
The hazing will start soon. Katie Martin
Jenn, you were writing about the sort of humdrum bunch of IPOs, of stock market listings that we’ve had so far this year in the newsletter the other day while we all fill in for that massive skiver, Rob Armstrong. Tell us what’s happening and what’s not happening. Jennifer Hughes
Yeah, Rob “Vacation” Armstrong, as we like to call him around here. Katie Martin
Vacay. Jennifer Hughes
Absolutely. IPOs are one of my favourite topics and I say that with a straight face. You can say what you like. But this year’s been disappointing. I mean, going public, it’s a vibe thing as much as the valuation and the metrics and the number of shares and the price and all the rest of it. It’s a real vibe, a momentum thing, and the momentum has just not been there. We’ve had some big deals and they’ve just fallen flat. They are not good. Katie Martin
A little bit of context is important here, right? So we’ve had a couple of years where the stock market has absolutely like, blown the doors off, right? We’ve had two years of 20 per cent-plus gains in the S&P 500. But the market for new listings has been like, really crap. Jennifer Hughes
Yes. I mean, running through that quickly, 2021 was the best year on record. Not even including SPACs, especially and the blank cheque companies, not including those. Just bog standard I have a company I’d like to sell you the shares kind of public companies. 2021 was this record. And as the stock market fell and the tax fell in 2022, that just killed the vibe, the market. So 2022 is bad for everybody. 2023, as you say, surprisingly good year for stocks — you know, bumper year. But the surprise was obviously the companies weren’t ready to go public. Plus, we all thought there was going to be a recession that year and it didn’t happen. So already-listed companies got to benefit. IPOs missed out. 2024, you think, well, recession fears have receded. This should be fine. But you’ve got the US elections. So uncertainty, volatility picks up from sort of late summer onwards. Well, frankly, you could say all year on with that one. So that kind of damped it last year. So this year, in theory, as you’ve been saying, should be their year. Aiden Reiter
It’s all about vibes and the vibe has just been not there the past two years. Katie Martin
Yes. And so a lot of these companies that are waiting to hit the public stock markets are already owned by private equity companies. And the narrative running into this year is that these private equity companies have ended up holding on to these portfolio companies for much longer than they normally would, much longer than they’re normally comfortable with because markets have been a bit sort of weird past few years. And so the idea was this kind of massive kind of waiting list, this pipeline, this is what people in this kind of bit of the market always talk about — this pipeline of companies that are just itching to hit the public markets. But there’s been a bit of a disconnect between. So the private equity firms have been saying, OK, I think this company is worth, I don’t know, say for the sake of argument, $1bn. And stock market investors have been saying we think it’s worth $500mn. And so there’s been this gap. And so the private equity companies have held on and held on and waited for the world to come around to their way of thinking. The idea has been that this year, everyone will agree that they’ve got to come to some other understanding and agree to disagree, and maybe the private equity companies aren’t gonna get the returns they thought they were gonna get. But either way, they’re gonna have to let go of these portfolio companies this year. Aiden Reiter
I think the other point is it’s not just private equity that is not releasing companies. Other companies that might have IPO’d faster might be holding on because there’s just more and more private capital flowing around that they can tap into, whether that be VC, private equity, so some of these start-ups don’t have to go on to the market. But Jenn, would you be able to walk us through some of the IPOs from this year that we’ve seen? Like what is the vibe of 2025? Jennifer Hughes
Sure. And part of the point is because we’ve got private equity and so much private capital, the companies that come to market are bigger. So it’s a bigger risk. It’s not like a $500mn company. It’s a multibillion company. So whatever they do, the deals are bigger. They’ve got to find more investors, the rest of it. We’ve had three this year, which have sort of, you know, not gone well and set an iffy tone to the whole market, I’d say. So first of all, we had Venture Global. That’s an LNG exporter, that’s liquefied natural gas to you and me. They put out a price range. They put out a price range initially and then they had to virtually halve it. That’s just not good. That says, OK, we thought we were worth 46 or something a share. We’re actually worth 23 a share. Aiden Reiter
They did that before they actually listed. They made some big hoopla. We’re gonna be worth 46. And then when they actually came out, they had different direction. Jennifer Hughes
Yeah. So the bankers go out with a price range and that could be raised in the US, at least; not all countries, but in the US that can be raised, lowered. And, you know, the investors are going, yeah, maybe this. I love this company, get me in. And then they’ll raise the price range. You don’t normally get a company that goes out there and starts having meetings with investors with a price range and then slashes it like that. That says you’re not in touch with reality. Katie Martin
Yeah. You haven’t done your homework, yeah? Jennifer Hughes
No. They’re down about a third since listing, last I looked. Katie Martin
They cut the price at which they listed and then when they listed, the market marked the shares down even further. OK, So that’s a bit of a doozy. What else is there? What are the happy stories you have for us? Jennifer Hughes
All right, Smithfield. This is my favourite pork producer. Katie Martin
Everyone needs a favourite pork producer. Jennifer Hughes
Well, they do. Smithfield is this US arm of it. It’s got a Chinese parent. And back in the day when the Chinese parent bought Smithfield, it’s about a decade-plus ago now, it was when Chinese deals were still . . . Was Chinese companies were still able to buy western ones and, you know, there was going to be some amazing synergy between a US pork producer and a Chinese one, which there isn’t. Katie Martin
A global pork empire. Jennifer Hughes
Well, it’s my favourite one because they tried to IPO in Hong Kong with I think it was 29 banks, which is a global record. When you see European names like Rabobank on a Hong Kong IPO, it’s funny. Basically, that deal fell apart. Twenty-nine banks couldn’t even sell this one. The only people that were rumoured to make money out of that were the Four Seasons hotel chain and Cathay Pacific, the airline. So anyway, I like this company. I’ve, you know, kept an interest in it. But they had their price range. And they had to price below. Again, this is just not a good look. Not as bad. They were sort of like, I think the bottom of the range was 23 and they had to price at 20 a share. But they had to price below and one of the executives had to buy about 10 per cent of the deal. I think it’s traded pretty flat since. It’s just, again, it’s not a good look. It doesn’t say this company has got energy and momentum and is cool and you should have a look at it. Aiden Reiter
It’s spoiled pork. Jennifer Hughes
Pulled pork. You can . . .  Aiden Reiter
Yeah. I’m kosher. I don’t eat pig. You can make up the pork joke, Katie. (Katie laughs) Jennifer Hughes
They didn’t bring home the bacon. Aiden Reiter
There we go. Katie Martin
I don’t think being kosher precludes you from making decent quality pork-based jokes, Aiden. Aiden Reiter
I just don’t have enough experience with the product. (Laughter) Katie Martin
Up your game. What this tells you, right? You have, like, an LNG deal and liquefied national oil and natural gas deal. It doesn’t go terribly well. You have a pork deal. It doesn’t go terribly well.

I mean, that’s 20 times as many orders as there are shares. That’s really good demand. So when you have a deal like that and it prices like that, with that momentum, it should trade up on the first day, right? Katie Martin
It should. Are you gonna tell me it didn’t? Jennifer Hughes
SailPoint sank gently. It didn’t collapse and it didn’t do badly. It didn’t rise. A deal like that, they could say, well, it could have been worse. It could. It could have really plunged. But it didn’t go well. And IPOs should have a small opening day pop at least — you know, a little bit to say to the investors who took the time to get to know the company: hey, look, you’re in the money on day one.

I’m just again gonna say that generally speaking, when you take regulations off financial markets, bad things happen and normal members of the public and taxpayers end up footing the bill like eight to 10 years later. So again, just putting out there. Personally, I think it’s a crap idea. Jennifer Hughes Well, when I asked people what regulation was a real problem, the two things that keep coming up or kept coming up were Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank. Now, Sarbanes-Oxley followed the Enron scandal, the accounting scandals of that period, the early 2000s. And Dodd-Frank came after the global financial crisis. So basically . . .  Aiden Reiter
Those are regulations, you know, laws that required markets to or, you know, investors to abide by certain laws. Is that right? Jennifer Hughes
They did. I mean, they are burdens on companies, sure, because, you know, you had to do things like sign off your accounts now, disclose your executive compensation policies and other such fun stuff. But yeah, these were reactions to massive disasters in the market. Katie Martin
It’s a bit like, you know, if you are close to a building site and there’ll be like a big sign outside it that says you got to wear a helmet. And you got to wear a hard-hat and you got to wear boots and you gotta wear a high-vis jacket and you can only enter the site if you’re registered. All of those regulations exist because some poor sod got killed by not following that rule. Do you know what I mean? Like health and safety rules are not there for just no reason. And it’s the same with markets rules. They’re there to stop people getting defrauded and stop terrible things happening. So call me old-fashioned and I will no doubt get emails from my usual correspondents. Hi, I’m Team Regulation, personally. So look, one last thing just to wrap up on here, going back to the IPOs. And actually, I did a podcast with Craig Coben, who used to do this sort of stuff for a living when he was a banker, around Christmastime. So, you know, scroll back and listen to that if you want some more on how IPOs work and all that sort of thing. But like to your mind, Jenn, who cares? Like, what does it matter if we get new companies in the stock market? Bankers get lovely bonuses out of it. Who else cares? Jennifer Hughes
I think, you know, Team Small Investor over here. But definitely we care because we want more companies to go public. We want companies that you and I can invest in. Our pensions will go into that kind of thing. So you need those companies to go public. Otherwise private companies can tell you what value they want. It’s not the scrutiny. I mean, one of the pushbacks I got . . . What of FTX, the Sam Bankman-Fried crypto exchange? What if that had been public? Do you think it would have had the same problems? Katie Martin
A good point. Jennifer Hughes
Quite a lot can be said for public companies and scrutiny. Katie Martin
Aiden, do you care? Aiden Reiter
I care. I agree with Jenn. We wanna be able to see into these companies. Also, you know, if you wanna have a good market, you need new innovative companies coming in, right? What if Nvidia had not listed a couple of years ago? The people who owned those shares would not be, you know, gazillionaires now. And isn’t that a great part of capitalism, that you can make these bets? Like, I’m all for markets working and I’m all for people being able to take their shots and small companies that pay off. Katie Martin So we’re pro markets, but we’re not pro chaos.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  I am also pro going to Long/Short.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  Alrighty. It’s time for Long/Short, that part of the show where we go long a thing we love or short a thing we hate. Aiden, do you have a long or a short? Aiden Reiter
Yeah, I do. I am short the idea of monetising the US balance sheet. This is something that Scott Bessent said they would do in order to make a sovereign wealth fund. Katie Martin
He’s the Treasury secretary. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. The US Treasury secretary said they would monetise the US’s balance sheet. If you look at the US’s balance sheet, most of the money is, you know, loans that are not particularly profitable, right? So student loans, other loans that you couldn’t easily sell off and the rest is property, plants and equipment. I don’t think we should be, you know, renting out the left nostril of George Washington on Mount Rushmore. So I don’t really know how they’re gonna monetise these assets unless there’s other cost savings they’re gonna find. So I’ve been short the idea of it. I think it’s very silly. Katie Martin
OK. Fair enough. Maybe in contrast, I am long the unexpected. So US foreign policy gone totally on its head. Domestic checks and balances in the States gone completely out the window. And yet markets are like, bobbing along. La la la la la. I’m sure nothing crazy will happen here. I’m just not so sure. I’m just saying watch out for highly unorthodox policy in financial markets because you just never know. Jenn, have you thought of anything yet? Jennifer Hughes
So I’m gonna go long, or at least a little bit long. I’m a journalist. Give me some caution here still. I go a little bit long the 10-year US Treasury. So this week, Bessent, Treasury secretary, as we said, came out and said he wasn’t going to alter in any quick sense the make-up of sort of the US Treasury borrowing schedule. This is actually quite a big deal for him because this is a guy that before Trump was elected was bashing the Treasury for having done all these short- term bills and not turning out enough debt. So it’s been costing the US money. He gets into power and he says, OK, we’ll stick with a system I was criticising. He says it’s part dependent, so it might change over time, but for now it means we’re not gonna see this flood of 10-year Treasuries, which is probably good for most investors and certainly probably the Treasury balance sheet. Katie Martin
So you’re saying if it was up to you, you’d be buying a little bit of that 10-year bond from Uncle Sam? [MUSIC PLAYING] Jennifer Hughes
Yes, just a little bit. Katie Martin
Just a little bit. Jennifer Hughes
The hedgesurance. Katie Martin

[MUSIC PLAYING]",2025-02-20,This is an audio transcript of the Unhedged podcast episode,"In a recent episode of the Unhedged podcast, host Katie Martin and guests Jennifer Hughes and Aiden Reiter discussed the current state of the Initial Public Offering (IPO) market. Despite expectations for a strong year in 2025, the market is surprisingly quiet with lackluster IPOs thus far in 2023, following a record year in 2021.

In 2022, tight market conditions and recession fears dampened IPO activity. Many potential companies looking to go public have been held back by private equity firms that are reluctant to lower their valuations, causing a disconnect between what they think their companies are worth and what the market is willing to pay.

The podcast highlights specific underperforming IPOs like Venture Global, a liquefied natural gas exporter, and Smithfield, a pork producer, both of which had disappointing starts, indicating a lack of investor confidence. Factors contributing to the sluggish IPO market include the abundance of private capital, increasing market volatility, and regulatory burdens imposed by laws established after past financial crises.

Despite the gloom, the guests argue that a vibrant IPO market is crucial for investor access to companies and market health. The conversation ends with an acknowledgment of the inherent uncertainty in the market, impacting companies’ decisions to go public."

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Katie Martin
Does the US government need an investment fund? A lot of people have dismissed the idea but you know what? It might just get one. Donald Trump has been talking about setting up what’s known as a sovereign wealth fund vaguely along the lines of the Middle East model, so big stashes of cash that invest across global stocks, bonds and whatever else they want. Today on the show, we’re asking: why, though?

This is Unhedged, the markets and finance podcast from the Financial Times and Pushkin. I’m Katie Martin, a markets columnist at FT towers in London, where the sun is finally making an appearance, and I’m joined, very fresh from his travels, by Aiden Reiter from the Unhedged newsletter in New York. Aiden, where have you been?

Aiden Reiter
I was in London hanging out with you, Katie, and then I was in Bosnia, Serbia and Israel.

Katie Martin
You’ve been to some wacky places.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah, it was really interesting. Would not recommend going to Sarajevo and Belgrade in the winter, but it was really, really beautiful.

Katie Martin
OK, noted. So, OK, a sovereign wealth fund, a Maga sovereign wealth fund, no less. What’s the score here?

Aiden Reiter
Well, Donald Trump has, I think, on February 3rd issued that they want to create a sovereign wealth fund for the benefit of the US population. That would theoretically allow them to invest in foreign assets, in US domestic priorities, whether that be promoting manufacturing, whether that be supporting supply chains. It’s unclear, right? They were not clear with what the actual goal of such a fund would be. We should note that they’re not the first administration to flirt with this idea. Apparently, the Biden administration also looked into making their own sovereign wealth fund. But we assume since they didn’t actually do it, they concluded that this is not the best idea.

Katie Martin
So what we’ve got now is there’s an executive order that’s been signed. Trump wants to see a plan from the Treasury secretary within the next couple of months. This is kind of weird, though, right?

So sovereign wealth funds, if you’re not familiar with them, they’re like big pots of cash that sort of sit somewhere in government apparatus and generally, they fall into a few buckets. Some of them are like savings funds, so they’re like piggy banks for the distant future. Some of them are stabilisation funds. So just in case in rainy days, say there’s some sort of crisis that hits you can tap into it then.

And some of them are like strategic funds, which are almost like, so you’re a government that’s got various state assets. You don’t quite know where to park them so you stick them in these special-purpose vehicles. So the big example of this, there’s quite a few of them in the Middle East, but the big example is Norway, right? So we had the chief exec of the Norwegian oil fund on this very podcast just a few months ago.

But the point is, Norway discovered oil, had oil coming out of its ears. Loads and loads of oil. Just too much money coming in all at once. And so the Norwegian government said, I know. Why don’t we take these oil revenues that we don’t want to spend all at once and put them in a fund and use them to invest around the world? And then when at some point we run out of oil or we decide not to drill any more of it out of the ground, we’ve still got these massive pots of national wealth.

The Brits, for what it’s worth, decided to do it differently, just spent it all back in the ’70s. And now look where we are. Anyway, that’s a whole other story. But the US is not quite in that situation, right? It’s not in a situation where it’s got too much money coming in, it doesn’t quite know what to do with it. So what is Donald Trump talking about here?

Aiden Reiter
We’re in the opposite situation. We are borrowing a lot of money, much more than we’re getting in terms of revenues from taxpayers or other oil and lease agreements. So he’s talking about trying to create some pile of money and it’s a pile of money we arguably don’t have right now, right? The US deficit is huge. It is growing. It is a constant problem for people in the market.

If you want to make a wealth fund, you need wealth. The United States does not have wealth right now. Now, there are some funds that theoretically could be tapped into and there are some pockets of money sitting around the US government that are kind of sitting idle, so you have things like the Exchange Stabilization Fund. As you were saying before, some countries have funds that they could deploy in the case of a crisis. The US government has about $200bn that could be deployed to support the US dollar. But it’s not that big of a fund. $200bn is not a lot in terms of how large and liquid the US dollar market is.

Katie Martin
Yeah. For the US, that’s not that much.

Aiden Reiter
No, exactly. And then, you know, we have gold in Fort Knox. It’s not that much. We do have something that’s huge and we’ve written an Unhedged newsletter on this. We have the Social Security Trust Funds, which are trillions of dollars. But those are very politically contentious because, say you were to take that fund and put it in the market and then lose that money, you would lose a lot of taxpayers’ money, which should be going to older people in the United States who have worked to have that money. So we sit on some . . . there’s some piles of money we could use, but it doesn’t really make sense because at the end of the day, if you want to make a wealth fund, you have to take it from some other part of the government or you have to borrow more.

Katie Martin
We’ve had like a bunch of brain boxes writing about this in the FT over the past few weeks. One of them is Brendan Greeley, who’s like a real nerd about this stuff. Hello, Brendan, if you’re listening, I mean nerd in the nicest possible way. As he points out, the White House like fact sheet for this executive order that says, I want a sovereign wealth fund, says that the US already holds $5.7tn in assets. But actually, only about — I say only, it’s a lot of money — but only about $1.2tn of that is in cash or gold. The rest of it is in often quite illiquid assets.

So what they’re talking about is issuing Maga bonds, potentially. This is like one way around it. So you issue Maga sovereign wealth fund bonds and you use the revenues that come from that and stick it into investments all round the world. Again, there’s still a lot of people who are just like scratching their heads and saying, I really don’t get the point of this.

And as Brendan points out in his piece, one of the potential problems you have here is, OK, so you have a pot of wealth that’s controlled by the US government in some form. What are the checks and balances that mean that that money will be deployed fairly and not for any kind of commercial or personal favours? So, for example, you look at the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund. That has so many guardrails around it that you don’t know which way is up, and it is achingly transparent about what money it deploys, when, to whom, on what grounds. You know, it’s got all sorts of like, ethical and sustainability requirements that go along with it. How would this money be deployed and how would you make sure that it wasn’t used to settle personal scores or to extract favours from foreign governments?

Aiden Reiter
Well, it would depend how you structure it, and that’s not clear from what we’ve gotten from Trump. This could wind up looking a little more like the Saudi oil fund, which is, you know, invested in the domestic economy and abroad. It’s extremely not transparent. That money’s often flowing to large family conglomerates with ties to the Saudi royal family. So it is, you know, it could become a basis of cronyism.

But there’s also other risks that you could have here. Even if there’s not guardrails and transparency measures, you could have a crowding-in effect or a crowding-out effect. If the government starts investing in certain public companies, investors might flock to that company and then the stock would go up and that would dilute returns. It could also cause some asset bubbles and, you know, inflationary events in the stock market based on where the money is getting put, right? If you think that’s where the government is invested, the governments could give them certain favours that other companies will not get. That results in an inefficient market.

That being said, that also could be the point, right? So one of the questions I’ve seen when people have talked about sovereign wealth funds is if you really want to make this strategic and invest in things in the US economy, we already have a process for that. It’s called legislation. The investment . . . yeah, the Inflation Reduction Act was about $1tn that went to green tech, bioenergy, all these really important sectors in the United States economy that are probably not getting enough market support to begin with, right? And the point of doing it that way is you have congressional approval, you have democratic processes here.

The point of a sovereign wealth fund, it would seem, would be to strategically deploy capital without the democratic counterbalances. That could just be the point. Trump has done a lot of things without Congress, right? It seems that he has no legislative agenda. He’s just pushing out these executive orders. This is a way to start taking some of the power of the purse away from Congress and throwing money where he sees fit.

Katie Martin
That’s an interesting way of looking at it. But I’ll tell you one thing. So, again, brain boxes writing in the FT about this. We’ve got a piece today by Stephen Jen. Now Stephen Jen, he’s a bit of a kind of like rock star in macro circles. He used to be like a currency, a macro analyst at Morgan Stanley back in the day, one for the hipsters there. And one of the things that he did was like in the early noughties was he was talking and writing a lot about sovereign wealth funds that were popping up all over the world and in countries that had like excess money effectively. You know, so he’s been looking into this stuff since way before it was cool. He’s writing in the FT today and saying, look, take this idea seriously. This could become the largest and most strategically important sovereign wealth fund in the world. He’s also pointing out that Trump has been talking to the Saudis, as you were mentioning earlier, and he was talking about the Saudi fund, which is like $925bn.

Aiden Reiter
A lot of money.

Katie Martin
It’s a lot of money. And he was saying, well, the Saudi fund is on the large side, but eventually we’ll catch it. That’s Trump’s kind of idea. So he’s talking big money and he’s potentially talking big money quickly.

And again, so Stephen Jen is saying, you know, imagine you have these Maga bonds that come along that are the kind of seed capital for this kind of fund. Say it gets to $2tn of assets under management. That’s a lot. That would make it one of, if not the biggest sovereign wealth fund on the planet. If that tracks how the S&P 500 — so the US stocks index — has been doing over the past 20 years, that could be $13.4tn in 20 years. So this could become, like, the US government weirdly could become like this gigantic hedge fund effectively.

Aiden Reiter
But again, even if they have those returns, you have to think about the impacts on the market, right? Just pumping $2tn into S&P 500 will inflate prices, will dilute returns. The market’s not gonna like that. Also, the market is already somewhat concerned over the level of the US deficit. And, you know, we’ve seen that a little bit in the term premium and in bond yields. This is always gonna be some form of borrowed dollars adding to the deficit. You could have a market implosion from this. So it’s not like it’s a costless event to create something like this. And it will have both impacts in the borrowing phase and the deployment phase. I would be very concerned.

Also, you know, one could argue that, well, we’re just gonna keep the deficit where it is and whatever cost savings we’re getting from Doge, we’ll just go into this. We’ve talked about this on the podcast before. It’s unclear how much money Doge will actually save. It doesn’t seem like it’s gonna be $2tn if they’re not going to slash Medicare and Social Security. So I am personally sceptical of what this could actually achieve in size, although it seems like he’s convinced this could be real.

Katie Martin
The thing is, if we’ve learned nothing else, like, I don’t know, it’s been a long month, but Donald Trump has been back in office for one month.

Aiden Reiter
Oh my God. It’s only been one month? (Laughter)

Katie Martin
(Laughter) It’s only been a month.

Aiden Reiter
I have so many more grey hairs.

Katie Martin
And, you know, big policy pronouncements and big ideas and big kind of norm-busting and checks and balances-busting initiatives are just like all over the place. And, you know, let’s do a, you know, a quick detour around Doge as you mentioned it and as I wrote about it in your newsletter today is that there was this idea before Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency came along that, you know, lots of investors and lots of analysts, investment banks were saying, look, we just don’t think that Doge is gonna be able to do that much. So it’s going to, you know, it’s gonna take a look at these government departments, but we don’t expect it to save very much money.

Actually, what has happened is that lots of federal employees have lost their jobs already and they’ve pretty much got rid of USAID, the overseas development agency. So there’s a lot of the sort of checks and balances and guardrails that don’t appear to be really working at the moment. And one thing that really strikes me is that the markets are just like, oh well, whatever. All this institutional resilience that we’ve spoken about for the past few decades as being absolutely central to the US as a reserve currency and as a reserve asset — turns out we’re actually not that bothered about it. I find this kind of amazing, personally.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah, it’s frustrating. Isn’t the market supposed to be the thing that stops reckless actions? But I think, you know, the things he’s done so far, tariffs aside, because tariffs definitely have large economic impacts, have more invisible economic impacts. USAID is very important to how the world functions. I would argue it’s very important to the US’s standing in the world, but it’s a relatively small part of the US’s budget and it doesn’t have immediate flow-through into US stocks, emerging market stocks, bond yields, etc.

Tariffs obviously will have some impact but the market still doesn’t know what to make of them. You know, we’re kind of in negotiation phases with some of them. And the rest hasn’t truly impacted the budget or hasn’t really truly impacted the economy. I think we’ll actually have to wait and see. Something like a sovereign wealth fund directly impacts the profile of US debt. And that is where the market might actually start to kick and scream or, you know, applaud. Who knows?

Katie Martin
Yeah. The thing is, there’s a lot of people who’ve been kind of waiting for that moment where markets kick and scream and they say, OK, these tariffs are too much or this destruction of checks and balances is too much, or this idea of a sovereign wealth fund is too wacky. But actually what the markets are doing is they’re fine. They’re looking at Doge and saying, oh, it’s cutting federal spending. That’s probably good for US government bonds. Let’s keep on buying.

So, yeah, it’s just a surprise to me that this sort of institutional thing is less of an immediate market mover than everyone was warning ahead of the election and I had previously thought.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah, I mean, I think it’s a strategic ambiguity. We don’t know exactly how these things will flow to the economy. Also, I think the markets have never been that good a gauge of politics. You know, especially, do we think investors are huge institutionalists, right? Are they gonna balk at the dissolution of Development Finance Corporation or USAID? I’m not sure how many investors are paying attention to those individual agencies before.

Katie Martin
So Aiden, like, this whole idea was a little bit out there. The US has never done this quite like this before, this idea that it might amass a pot of cash, a big sovereign wealth fund for deploying in any way that it sees fit. But if it happens, it could be one of the biggest investment funds on the planet. Like, do you think this is really gonna happen?

Aiden Reiter
It’s hard to say, but I can give my pros and cons. I think pro is, as you said, you know, this is A, you can use market forces to grow a big pot of money for the American people. If that works, that’s fantastic. It could help things like social security. It could help things like healthcare; you know, creating larger pots of money for people. Other pro: theoretically, it creates a nimble way for a president, if you believe in a powerful executive, to invest in their domestic priorities or their international priorities.

I think there’s too many big cons. This doesn’t, you know, we don’t actually have wealth to speak of, right? (Laughter) Like, you have to borrow. This undermines so many of the deficit-reduction things the Trump administration has said they’re trying to do. It also has so many possible failures, right? So if you lose that money in the market, which is always a risk, huge political backlash. You could have cronyism. You could have huge return dilution if you take trillions of dollars of US funds and throw them into the market. I don’t think people would be very happy about that. So overall, I’m coming out as this doesn’t make much sense and it seems like just a frustrating way to get around the legislature, but I am open to other opinions. What about you, Katie?

Katie Martin
I’m pretty much done with thinking about pros and cons of government policy anywhere because I just feel like so far this year you look at something and you think, wow, that’s a terrible idea. Don’t do that. Oh, I see you’ve already done it, you know. So, you know, like, it is not up to me. And so, you know, we just have to accept the world as we find it. I agree with you that there’s a like a lot of potential banana skins here. But I feel like if this is what Donald Trump wants, then this is likely to be what Donald Trump gets. So we’ll just have to see what the market impact will be.

But I guess I’m wondering, you know, OK, when you get the phone call from Donald Trump or Scott Bessent and saying, hey, Aiden, how about it? Do you want to manage, let me check, $2tn of assets? Are you available? Are your services available?

Aiden Reiter
Well, given that I would be the same, you know, I’m the same age as all these guys running Doge, I guess I’m qualified.

Katie Martin
Yes. Very good point.

Aiden Reiter
But I think I would have . . . But you know, I think I’d have to wait and see how my this year’s stock picking returns come out for the FT contest before I put myself up to manage the US’s money.

Katie Martin
But you’re right. These are salad days for young men. So you know, Mr President, Aiden is waiting for your call.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

We’re gonna be back in a sec with Long/Short.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Alrighty. It’s time for Long/Short, that part the show where we go long a thing we love or short a thing we hate. Aiden, what’s on your mind?

Aiden Reiter
I am long the reappearance of Chinese mogul Jack Ma.

Katie Martin
Where has he been?

Aiden Reiter
He’s been out of the public eye, potentially under government, you know, duress and pushed out of the spotlight by the government, allegedly. He has somewhat reappeared. There is some high-level discourse with government officials and I believe he spoke with Xi Jinping.

Either way, I’m not sure what this actually portends for the future of the Chinese economy, for the future of Alibaba. I just find it interesting and I missed having, you know, the Chinese mobile discord. I feel like we we’ve been focused so much on Chinese leadership. Where were the business leaders? This is gonna be an interesting year to talk about them.

Katie Martin
They’re back.

Aiden Reiter
They’re back.

Katie Martin
I am long Diet Coke.

Aiden Reiter
(Laughter) You and everyone else.

Katie Martin
Other beverages are available, but Emma Jacobs wrote a very funny column in the paper today about this, saying that it’s the rocket fuel of America’s macho working habits. That’s not why I like it. I’m just slightly addicted to it. But I do keep it down to one can a day. Apparently, your president drinks 12 cans of this stuff a day. How is that even possible?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Aiden Reiter
I wish I had his genetics because if I had his diet, I think I’d be a puddle.

Katie Martin
I mean, he’s obviously made of strong stuff. As of course we should all be so that we’re still around on Thursday to listen to the podcast again then. So listen up.

So what we’ve got now is there’s an executive order that’s been signed. Trump wants to see a plan from the Treasury secretary within the next couple of months. This is kind of weird, though, right? So sovereign wealth funds, if you’re not familiar with them, they’re like big pots of cash that sort of sit somewhere in government apparatus and generally, they fall into a few buckets. Some of them are like savings funds, so they’re like piggy banks for the distant future. Some of them are stabilisation funds. So just in case in rainy days, say there’s some sort of crisis that hits you can tap into it then. And some of them are like strategic funds, which are almost like, so you’re a government that’s got various state assets. You don’t quite know where to park them so you stick them in these special-purpose vehicles. So the big example of this, there’s quite a few of them in the Middle East, but the big example is Norway, right? So we had the chief exec of the Norwegian oil fund on this very podcast just a few months ago. But the point is, Norway discovered oil, had oil coming out of its ears. Loads and loads of oil. Just too much money coming in all at once. And so the Norwegian government said, I know. Why don’t we take these oil revenues that we don’t want to spend all at once and put them in a fund and use them to invest around the world? And then when at some point we run out of oil or we decide not to drill any more of it out of the ground, we’ve still got these massive pots of national wealth. The Brits, for what it’s worth, decided to do it differently, just spent it all back in the ’70s. And now look where we are. Anyway, that’s a whole other story. But the US is not quite in that situation, right? It’s not in a situation where it’s got too much money coming in, it doesn’t quite know what to do with it. So what is Donald Trump talking about here? Aiden Reiter
We’re in the opposite situation. We are borrowing a lot of money, much more than we’re getting in terms of revenues from taxpayers or other oil and lease agreements. So he’s talking about trying to create some pile of money and it’s a pile of money we arguably don’t have right now, right? The US deficit is huge. It is growing. It is a constant problem for people in the market. If you want to make a wealth fund, you need wealth. The United States does not have wealth right now. Now, there are some funds that theoretically could be tapped into and there are some pockets of money sitting around the US government that are kind of sitting idle, so you have things like the Exchange Stabilization Fund. As you were saying before, some countries have funds that they could deploy in the case of a crisis. The US government has about $200bn that could be deployed to support the US dollar. But it’s not that big of a fund. $200bn is not a lot in terms of how large and liquid the US dollar market is. Katie Martin
Yeah. For the US, that’s not that much. Aiden Reiter
No, exactly. And then, you know, we have gold in Fort Knox. It’s not that much. We do have something that’s huge and we’ve written an Unhedged newsletter on this. We have the Social Security Trust Funds, which are trillions of dollars. But those are very politically contentious because, say you were to take that fund and put it in the market and then lose that money, you would lose a lot of taxpayers’ money, which should be going to older people in the United States who have worked to have that money. So we sit on some . . . there’s some piles of money we could use, but it doesn’t really make sense because at the end of the day, if you want to make a wealth fund, you have to take it from some other part of the government or you have to borrow more. Katie Martin
We’ve had like a bunch of brain boxes writing about this in the FT over the past few weeks. One of them is Brendan Greeley, who’s like a real nerd about this stuff. Hello, Brendan, if you’re listening, I mean nerd in the nicest possible way. As he points out, the White House like fact sheet for this executive order that says, I want a sovereign wealth fund, says that the US already holds $5.7tn in assets. But actually, only about — I say only, it’s a lot of money — but only about $1.2tn of that is in cash or gold. The rest of it is in often quite illiquid assets. So what they’re talking about is issuing Maga bonds, potentially. This is like one way around it. So you issue Maga sovereign wealth fund bonds and you use the revenues that come from that and stick it into investments all round the world. Again, there’s still a lot of people who are just like scratching their heads and saying, I really don’t get the point of this. And as Brendan points out in his piece, one of the potential problems you have here is, OK, so you have a pot of wealth that’s controlled by the US government in some form. What are the checks and balances that mean that that money will be deployed fairly and not for any kind of commercial or personal favours? So, for example, you look at the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund. That has so many guardrails around it that you don’t know which way is up, and it is achingly transparent about what money it deploys, when, to whom, on what grounds. You know, it’s got all sorts of like, ethical and sustainability requirements that go along with it. How would this money be deployed and how would you make sure that it wasn’t used to settle personal scores or to extract favours from foreign governments? Aiden Reiter
Well, it would depend how you structure it, and that’s not clear from what we’ve gotten from Trump. This could wind up looking a little more like the Saudi oil fund, which is, you know, invested in the domestic economy and abroad. It’s extremely not transparent. That money’s often flowing to large family conglomerates with ties to the Saudi royal family. So it is, you know, it could become a basis of cronyism. But there’s also other risks that you could have here. Even if there’s not guardrails and transparency measures, you could have a crowding-in effect or a crowding-out effect. If the government starts investing in certain public companies, investors might flock to that company and then the stock would go up and that would dilute returns. It could also cause some asset bubbles and, you know, inflationary events in the stock market based on where the money is getting put, right? If you think that’s where the government is invested, the governments could give them certain favours that other companies will not get. That results in an inefficient market. That being said, that also could be the point, right? So one of the questions I’ve seen when people have talked about sovereign wealth funds is if you really want to make this strategic and invest in things in the US economy, we already have a process for that. It’s called legislation. The investment . . . yeah, the Inflation Reduction Act was about $1tn that went to green tech, bioenergy, all these really important sectors in the United States economy that are probably not getting enough market support to begin with, right? And the point of doing it that way is you have congressional approval, you have democratic processes here. The point of a sovereign wealth fund, it would seem, would be to strategically deploy capital without the democratic counterbalances. That could just be the point. Trump has done a lot of things without Congress, right? It seems that he has no legislative agenda. He’s just pushing out these executive orders. This is a way to start taking some of the power of the purse away from Congress and throwing money where he sees fit. Katie Martin
That’s an interesting way of looking at it. But I’ll tell you one thing. So, again, brain boxes writing in the FT about this. We’ve got a piece today by Stephen Jen. Now Stephen Jen, he’s a bit of a kind of like rock star in macro circles. He used to be like a currency, a macro analyst at Morgan Stanley back in the day, one for the hipsters there. And one of the things that he did was like in the early noughties was he was talking and writing a lot about sovereign wealth funds that were popping up all over the world and in countries that had like excess money effectively. You know, so he’s been looking into this stuff since way before it was cool. He’s writing in the FT today and saying, look, take this idea seriously. This could become the largest and most strategically important sovereign wealth fund in the world. He’s also pointing out that Trump has been talking to the Saudis, as you were mentioning earlier, and he was talking about the Saudi fund, which is like $925bn. Aiden Reiter
A lot of money. Katie Martin
It’s a lot of money. And he was saying, well, the Saudi fund is on the large side, but eventually we’ll catch it. That’s Trump’s kind of idea. So he’s talking big money and he’s potentially talking big money quickly. And again, so Stephen Jen is saying, you know, imagine you have these Maga bonds that come along that are the kind of seed capital for this kind of fund. Say it gets to $2tn of assets under management. That’s a lot. That would make it one of, if not the biggest sovereign wealth fund on the planet. If that tracks how the S&P 500 — so the US stocks index — has been doing over the past 20 years, that could be $13.4tn in 20 years. So this could become, like, the US government weirdly could become like this gigantic hedge fund effectively. Aiden Reiter
But again, even if they have those returns, you have to think about the impacts on the market, right? Just pumping $2tn into S&P 500 will inflate prices, will dilute returns. The market’s not gonna like that. Also, the market is already somewhat concerned over the level of the US deficit. And, you know, we’ve seen that a little bit in the term premium and in bond yields. This is always gonna be some form of borrowed dollars adding to the deficit. You could have a market implosion from this. So it’s not like it’s a costless event to create something like this. And it will have both impacts in the borrowing phase and the deployment phase. I would be very concerned. Also, you know, one could argue that, well, we’re just gonna keep the deficit where it is and whatever cost savings we’re getting from Doge, we’ll just go into this. We’ve talked about this on the podcast before. It’s unclear how much money Doge will actually save. It doesn’t seem like it’s gonna be $2tn if they’re not going to slash Medicare and Social Security. So I am personally sceptical of what this could actually achieve in size, although it seems like he’s convinced this could be real. Katie Martin
The thing is, if we’ve learned nothing else, like, I don’t know, it’s been a long month, but Donald Trump has been back in office for one month. Aiden Reiter
Oh my God. It’s only been one month? (Laughter) Katie Martin
(Laughter) It’s only been a month. Aiden Reiter
I have so many more grey hairs. Katie Martin
And, you know, big policy pronouncements and big ideas and big kind of norm-busting and checks and balances-busting initiatives are just like all over the place. And, you know, let’s do a, you know, a quick detour around Doge as you mentioned it and as I wrote about it in your newsletter today is that there was this idea before Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency came along that, you know, lots of investors and lots of analysts, investment banks were saying, look, we just don’t think that Doge is gonna be able to do that much. So it’s going to, you know, it’s gonna take a look at these government departments, but we don’t expect it to save very much money. Actually, what has happened is that lots of federal employees have lost their jobs already and they’ve pretty much got rid of USAID, the overseas development agency. So there’s a lot of the sort of checks and balances and guardrails that don’t appear to be really working at the moment. And one thing that really strikes me is that the markets are just like, oh well, whatever. All this institutional resilience that we’ve spoken about for the past few decades as being absolutely central to the US as a reserve currency and as a reserve asset — turns out we’re actually not that bothered about it. I find this kind of amazing, personally. Aiden Reiter
Yeah, it’s frustrating. Isn’t the market supposed to be the thing that stops reckless actions? But I think, you know, the things he’s done so far, tariffs aside, because tariffs definitely have large economic impacts, have more invisible economic impacts. USAID is very important to how the world functions. I would argue it’s very important to the US’s standing in the world, but it’s a relatively small part of the US’s budget and it doesn’t have immediate flow-through into US stocks, emerging market stocks, bond yields, etc. Tariffs obviously will have some impact but the market still doesn’t know what to make of them. You know, we’re kind of in negotiation phases with some of them. And the rest hasn’t truly impacted the budget or hasn’t really truly impacted the economy. I think we’ll actually have to wait and see. Something like a sovereign wealth fund directly impacts the profile of US debt. And that is where the market might actually start to kick and scream or, you know, applaud. Who knows? Katie Martin
Yeah. The thing is, there’s a lot of people who’ve been kind of waiting for that moment where markets kick and scream and they say, OK, these tariffs are too much or this destruction of checks and balances is too much, or this idea of a sovereign wealth fund is too wacky. But actually what the markets are doing is they’re fine. They’re looking at Doge and saying, oh, it’s cutting federal spending. That’s probably good for US government bonds. Let’s keep on buying. So, yeah, it’s just a surprise to me that this sort of institutional thing is less of an immediate market mover than everyone was warning ahead of the election and I had previously thought. Aiden Reiter
Yeah, I mean, I think it’s a strategic ambiguity. We don’t know exactly how these things will flow to the economy. Also, I think the markets have never been that good a gauge of politics. You know, especially, do we think investors are huge institutionalists, right? Are they gonna balk at the dissolution of Development Finance Corporation or USAID? I’m not sure how many investors are paying attention to those individual agencies before. Katie Martin
So Aiden, like, this whole idea was a little bit out there. The US has never done this quite like this before, this idea that it might amass a pot of cash, a big sovereign wealth fund for deploying in any way that it sees fit. But if it happens, it could be one of the biggest investment funds on the planet. Like, do you think this is really gonna happen? Aiden Reiter
It’s hard to say, but I can give my pros and cons. I think pro is, as you said, you know, this is A, you can use market forces to grow a big pot of money for the American people. If that works, that’s fantastic. It could help things like social security. It could help things like healthcare; you know, creating larger pots of money for people. Other pro: theoretically, it creates a nimble way for a president, if you believe in a powerful executive, to invest in their domestic priorities or their international priorities. I think there’s too many big cons. This doesn’t, you know, we don’t actually have wealth to speak of, right? (Laughter) Like, you have to borrow. This undermines so many of the deficit-reduction things the Trump administration has said they’re trying to do. It also has so many possible failures, right? So if you lose that money in the market, which is always a risk, huge political backlash. You could have cronyism. You could have huge return dilution if you take trillions of dollars of US funds and throw them into the market. I don’t think people would be very happy about that. So overall, I’m coming out as this doesn’t make much sense and it seems like just a frustrating way to get around the legislature, but I am open to other opinions. What about you, Katie? Katie Martin
I’m pretty much done with thinking about pros and cons of government policy anywhere because I just feel like so far this year you look at something and you think, wow, that’s a terrible idea. Don’t do that. Oh, I see you’ve already done it, you know. So, you know, like, it is not up to me. And so, you know, we just have to accept the world as we find it. I agree with you that there’s a like a lot of potential banana skins here. But I feel like if this is what Donald Trump wants, then this is likely to be what Donald Trump gets. So we’ll just have to see what the market impact will be. But I guess I’m wondering, you know, OK, when you get the phone call from Donald Trump or Scott Bessent and saying, hey, Aiden, how about it? Do you want to manage, let me check, $2tn of assets? Are you available? Are your services available? Aiden Reiter
Well, given that I would be the same, you know, I’m the same age as all these guys running Doge, I guess I’m qualified. Katie Martin
Yes. Very good point. Aiden Reiter
But I think I would have . . . But you know, I think I’d have to wait and see how my this year’s stock picking returns come out for the FT contest before I put myself up to manage the US’s money. Katie Martin But you’re right. These are salad days for young men. So you know, Mr President, Aiden is waiting for your call.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  We’re gonna be back in a sec with Long/Short.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  Alrighty. It’s time for Long/Short, that part the show where we go long a thing we love or short a thing we hate. Aiden, what’s on your mind? Aiden Reiter
I am long the reappearance of Chinese mogul Jack Ma. Katie Martin
Where has he been? Aiden Reiter
He’s been out of the public eye, potentially under government, you know, duress and pushed out of the spotlight by the government, allegedly. He has somewhat reappeared. There is some high-level discourse with government officials and I believe he spoke with Xi Jinping. Either way, I’m not sure what this actually portends for the future of the Chinese economy, for the future of Alibaba. I just find it interesting and I missed having, you know, the Chinese mobile discord. I feel like we we’ve been focused so much on Chinese leadership. Where were the business leaders? This is gonna be an interesting year to talk about them. Katie Martin
They’re back. Aiden Reiter
They’re back. Katie Martin
I am long Diet Coke. Aiden Reiter
(Laughter) You and everyone else. Katie Martin
Other beverages are available, but Emma Jacobs wrote a very funny column in the paper today about this, saying that it’s the rocket fuel of America’s macho working habits. That’s not why I like it. I’m just slightly addicted to it. But I do keep it down to one can a day. Apparently, your president drinks 12 cans of this stuff a day. How is that even possible? [MUSIC PLAYING] Aiden Reiter
I wish I had his genetics because if I had his diet, I think I’d be a puddle. Katie Martin
I mean, he’s obviously made of strong stuff. As of course we should all be so that we’re still around on Thursday to listen to the podcast again then. So listen up.

[MUSIC PLAYING]",2025-02-18,This is an audio transcript of the Unhedged podcast episode,"In a recent episode of the Unhedged podcast, hosts Katie Martin and Aiden Reiter discuss the potential establishment of a U.S. sovereign wealth fund, as proposed by Donald Trump. Sovereign wealth funds are large government-owned investment funds that manage national savings or revenues for future use or crisis stabilization.

Trump's plans are vague but suggest using the fund to invest in both foreign and domestic priorities, such as manufacturing and supply chains. Previous administrations, including Biden's, have considered similar ideas but did not proceed, likely due to concerns about feasibility and financial implications, especially given the U.S. deficit.

Currently, the U.S. does not have abundant wealth to fund such a project; it is borrowing significantly. For a sovereign wealth fund to exist, it would require tapping into existing government resources or increasing debt, which raises concerns about political misuse and inefficiency.

The podcast highlights potential risks, such as market inefficiencies, inflationary effects, and the establishment of cronyism if the fund isn't transparently managed. There are also debates over whether creating such a fund bypasses democratic processes traditionally involved in strategic investments.

While proponents, including analysts, argue that this could create substantial national wealth, many skeptics question its practicality and potential negative impacts on both the market and U.S. debt levels. Overall, the hosts express uncertainty about the fund's viability and future market effects."

Katie Martin
Look, we try not to talk about Donald Trump on this show all the time but, you know, two things. One, he’s the leader of the free world. Two, he has a whole bunch of economic policies up his sleeve that matter enormously to markets and that is very much our jam. And the latest curveball has landed on the market for metals.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

The president wants a massive 25 per cent tax on all US imports of steel and aluminium, or aluminum, if you prefer, wherever it comes from — China, Europe, UK, whatever. This has sent metals markets a little bit bananas. Today on the show, we’re breaking down for you what is going on here, why we should all care, and how this fits into the broader trade strategy. This is Unhedged, the markets and finance podcast from the Financial Times and Pushkin. I’m Katie Martin, a markets columnist at the FT in London, and I’m joined by a dynamic duo today. In the blue corner down the line from New York City, the bruiser from the Unhedged newser, Rob Armstrong.

Robert Armstrong
Greetings.

Katie Martin
But also, in the red corner, a newbie on this podcast, the undisputed heavyweight trade nerd of the FT, Alan Beattie, here in the London studio with me. Alan, welcome to the show.

Alan Beattie
Thank you. Why am I in the red corner?

Katie Martin
I don’t know.

Alan Beattie
OK.

Katie Martin
So, look, all these years you’ve been nerding out on trade and now suddenly, like, are these the best of days or the worst of days for you?

Alan Beattie
Someone in the trade world said it’s kind of like we’ve all been working in this quiet corner of the library. Nobody’s bothered us. No one else wanted to take those books out. And suddenly the doors open, all these people crash in and pulling books off the shelves and all the rest of it. You’ve got to suppress the temptation just to go, “Sssh!” (Robert laughs)

Katie Martin
Yeah. And also, these are my books. Get out of here.

Alan Beattie
Get out of here. Instead of which, you’ve got to try to open up, turn around and go, let me tell you about tariffs.

Katie Martin
Now, children, sit down while I explain to you what is going on. So let’s start with the metal stuff. What is the latest proposal and is it serious?

Alan Beattie
There’s a thing I always say about trade under Donald Trump, which is what the screenwriter William Goldman, who wrote The Princess Bride, among other things, said, which is in Hollywood, nobody knows anything. Nobody knows anything. Because with Trump, he thinks about five contradictory things. He has about eight people around him who also think things that contradict each other and indeed themselves. So who knows?

What is true is that, you know, he did put on steel and aluminium tariffs in his first term, 25 per cent for steel and 10 per cent for aluminium. Now, he suspended a bunch of those. Biden negotiated some sort of suspensions and loopholes and so forth. But he does have form in putting them on.

Katie Martin
Yeah. So there’s all sorts of like, little kind of loopholes and exemptions and whatnot that came in the last administration. And now he’s saying, right, all that is gone; 25 per cent on everything.

Robert Armstrong
Alan, why steel and aluminium? Why not pears and stuffed animals, if you know what I mean? Why this?

Alan Beattie
It’s always, always steel. Steel screws up the entire global trading system for everyone else. I annoy people massively when I say this and actually, we have people from the Biden administration saying, Alan, if you understood the lives of steel workers, you know, you might not be so dismissive about it; pointed out to them I grew up 10 miles away from a steel mill. I know what steel mills are. They’d grown up about 600 miles away from a steel mill. This is why I had no friends in the Biden administration. But it is a symbol of industrial strength. It’s a symbol of manufacturing.

Katie Martin
It’s men doing things in hot places with big hammers and stuff.

Alan Beattie
We all think steel is cool. It’s also really concentrated. You know, if a steel mill closes down, as it did near me, and you get three, four, five, 6,000 jobs gone bang in a day, that’s really dramatic in a way that, you know, losing jobs across the service sector is not.

Robert Armstrong
It’s not only dramatic. It attaches to a very specific political power centre. That representative, that senator whatever, you know, has a serious bone to pick.

Alan Beattie
That’s certainly true in the US. Not everywhere, but certainly in the US. You know, that’s the other thing. Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, these are the swing states. I mean, it’s absolutely true that the Biden administration, Katherine Tai, according to people who had spoken to her, they told me that she or certainly USTR, explicitly said to them, you’ve got to help us win Pennsylvania. You’ve got to give us what we want on steel because you’ve got to help us win Pennsylvania.

Katie Martin
Right. So it’s almost like an emotional issue and it’s a very political issue.

Alan Beattie
It’s very emotional. It’s very political. It’s very symbolic. And I say it’s been screwing up the trading system for decades.

Robert Armstrong
I think listeners are probably familiar with the standard argument against steel tariffs that whatever you gain in terms of steel jobs, you lose in terms of other manufacturing jobs by making input costs in industries that make things out of steel higher.

Alan Beattie
That’s absolutely true. The estimates are something like 80 jobs in downstream steel-using industries for every job in steel.

Robert Armstrong
Yeah. So it’s terrible. I’m interested to hear the kind of worldwide or geopolitical implications of this and indeed the whole Trump tariff set. What is the rest of the world? How much does it matter to them? What are they gonna do in response? What is the state of play in terms of responses from the rest of the world?

Katie Martin
You are stealing all of my questions.

Robert Armstrong
OK. I’m sorry. I’m just curious. I’m a curious man. We have an expert here. I’m just pushing ahead with the discussion, Katie.

Katie Martin
(Laughter) Go for it.

Alan Beattie
So if this was only metals, right, I don’t think everyone would be as quite as alarmed as they are because, you know, as I say, there’s always a lot of stuff about steel and metals and so on. For example, there’s almost no Chinese steel actually circulating in the US because there’s so much effort has been made to keep it out with various tariffs or so forth.

It’s not just that. It’s the fact that Trump is trying to use tariffs for a whole bunch of other reasons, right? He suddenly comes up with these coercive tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Twenty-five per cent tariffs are going to be implemented in, what was it, 72 hours to stop an almost non-existent flow of fentanyl across the Canadian border and to encourage them to do stuff on immigration they’re already doing. For Mexico and Canada that’s enormous.

Katie Martin
And that’s just delayed, right? In theory, that’s still happening.

Alan Beattie
And still that’s delayed until March the 4th. So who knows whether they will come up with something else to buy him off? I think they’ve already appointed a fentanyl tsar. So I don’t know if they just . . . I don’t know how you escalate that. Maybe a fentanyl emperor or a vizier. (Robert and Katie laugh) You know something? I wouldn’t like to be . . . I’d like to be a grand vizier of fentanyl. We won’t actually like to do the work. Just do a little bit of advice.

Katie Martin
It’d look great on your LinkedIn.

Alan Beattie
Look weird, wouldn’t it? (Laughter)

Robert Armstrong
First fentanyl lord. (Laughter)

Katie Martin
But all things being equal, right? Like, so say this happens, right, the steel tariffs. Then what is the impact on industry? Because as you say, like, it’s great if you happen to be a steelworker. It’s not that great if you happen to be someone who makes cars or puts food in cans for a living, right?

Alan Beattie
That’s right. It will hit the car industry. It will hit all of those industries. But the thing is, it doesn’t hit any of them dramatically enough that they really complain that much. You know, I’ve always wondered, why does the car industry in America not complain more given that it is one of its basic inputs? And people always say, yeah, but the thing is, the car industry benefits a lot from what they call trade remedies, right, from blocks on cheap imports as well. So they don’t necessarily wanna bring the whole system down because they kind of benefit from it as well.

Katie Martin
Right. But it’s just like a pain in the ass. So what we’re already seeing is that like, consumers of metals in the US — because the US is a net importer of these metals — they’re already paying a higher price for copper, for example, which isn’t in the current set of new tariff proposals, but probably will be. So they’re paying . . . Already, they’re paying a higher price for copper, aluminium and steel. I insist on keeping calling it aluminium.

Robert Armstrong
Is that a different metal than aluminum? Is that like really good aluminum?

Katie Martin
Yes, it’s posh aluminum. (Robert laughs) So they’re already paying what’s known as the Midwest premium to get hold of this metal because they wanna get ahead of these tariffs and buy these metals quicker. So yeah, I guess I kind of don’t get either why people are not up in arms and saying, what the hell? You’ve just raised our production costs.

Robert Armstrong
I think Alan has given us part of the answer, which is that the benefits of tariffs are concentrated and the costs are diffused.

Alan Beattie
This is true. And also they don’t actually know whether he’s gonna go ahead with them or not. You know, if you actually start throwing stuff out the pump. And also, do you want to cross Donald Trump? Really? We’ve seen what happens to people who crossed Donald Trump. It’s not very pleasant sometimes. So if you’re gonna actually really come out publicly and take a pop at the administration, you might want to wait until you’re sure these things are actually hit rather than look like a bit of an idiot by coming out, burning a whole load of bridges and it’s not gonna happen anyway.

Robert Armstrong
How does the rest of the world respond, Alan? Strategically, what moves are they making and are they intelligent?

Alan Beattie
So if we look more broadly, because it’s not just steel — and I won’t say aluminum, in deference to Rob. Rob used to be my boss. He told me to say aluminum.

Katie Martin
Never show deference to Rob.

Alan Beattie
He told me I would be fired if I didn’t say aluminum. (Robert laughs) But I mean, he was a vicious boss. He really was. You know. So they’re having to deal with a whole bunch of stuff, if you’re Canada and Mexico, you’re dealing with this 25 per cent. You’re dealing with the metals tariffs. You’re dealing with this wacky plan they’ve got for reciprocal tariffs.

Katie Martin
I don’t understand what they are. Tell me what they are.

Robert Armstrong
Yes, let’s have a pause to talk about reciprocal tariffs. This is an important point.

Alan Beattie
Funnily enough, this is actually written down on his policy platform, his campaign platform, unlike most of this. Quite simply, you set the US tariffs equivalent to the product of any given trading partner. So if you are trading with the EU on cars, the US has a 2 or 2.5 per cent tariff on most cars — we’ll go on to that — and the EU has 10. So you say to the EU, right, either you cut your 10 per cent tariff to 2 or we raise our 2 per cent tariff to 10. So it’s just a tit for tat.

Robert Armstrong
I have a question in the back. What about countries where things don’t match? Like we match kind of Europe in cars, but like with Colombia, we take their coffee and presumably their cocaine — but I don’t think there’s a cocaine tariff — and they take our whatever it is we send to them. I don’t know if it’s chicken or whatever we send. And so, like what they tariff us on coffee and what we tariff them on whatever it is we send to them presumably doesn’t matter to the other party.

Alan Beattie
Shut up, Rob. Rob, shut up. Shut up. Shut up. (Robert laughs) Don’t tell them that, OK? They haven’t worked it out and it’s gonna be really funny when suddenly everyone’s drinking really expensive coffee or snorting really expensive coke. And it will have . . . And amazingly enough, the great coffee growers of the upper Wisconsin mountains . . . 

Robert Armstrong
Exactly.

Alan Beattie
 . . . do not, in fact, benefit from this. Exactly. You know, it’s not thought through for a bunch of reasons. The other reason it’s not thought through even more so is it’s kind of predicated on this idea that American tariffs are always lower, right? And Americans believe this. They believe they’re a free trade country. They’re taken advantage of by the rest of the world, blah blah blah. By and large, they are lower.

There are a bunch of places, particularly in agriculture, they are very much not. So classic one being sugar, right? The cane growers down in Florida, politically very powerful. I think it’s now pretty well established that Bill Clinton, when he was enjoying private time in the Oval Office with Monica Lewinsky, took a call from the Florida sugar growers. That’s how important they are. Now, the tariffs on that sugar in the US are actually quite high. I got someone to run the numbers and they came up with numbers above 40 per cent.

Katie Martin
What?

Alan Beattie
Because, you know, if you are a rich country, that’s what you can afford to do. You basically say we can afford to protect this particular bunch of farmers who until quite recently were in a swing state. So that’s why they get that protection.

Robert Armstrong
You wrote something about pick-up trucks, too. Is this another example of this? We tariff the foreign pick-up truck.

Alan Beattie
This is the so-called chicken tax, which LBJ put on light trucks, including pick-up trucks from Europe, in a rage, in fact, from everywhere, in a rage, because Europeans put taxes, put tariffs on American chicken. That dispute, by the way, in a slightly different guise is still going on. So that’s a 25 per cent tariff on pick-up trucks. And I’m told that’s the only bit of Detroit that actually makes money.

So let’s say the US does do this and it cuts its own tariffs, right, if it’s going to be fair. So it’s gonna cut its sugar tariffs down to Brazilian levels, which are like, I think, 16 per cent. And if Brazil has any wit, they’ll cut their tariffs to nil and then they’ll have a 0 per cent tariff. The US will be absolutely flooded with Brazilian sugar. Nobody grows sugar cheaper than the Brazilians.

If they cut their light truck tariff from 25 per cent down to European levels, which are 10 per cent, with Europeans, which they’ve offered to do actually, cut their car tariffs down to 2 per cent, which are the American level, then suddenly Detroit loses all of its protection. So what you’ve got to assume is there’s gonna be a load of hypocrisy going on here where . . . I know. We’ve never seen it before in trade.

Katie Martin
Say it ain’t so.

Alan Beattie
We’ve never seen it before. But here it is. It’s very sad. I think it’s all these new people coming in.

Katie Martin
It’s almost as if none of this stuff makes any sense, Alan. So let me ask you, what does this mean for the rest of the world in the sense that the German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp was saying if the US tariffs do come into effect, then what we’re gonna end up with is loads more Chinese steel flooding, if steel can flood, into the European market. And so it kind of screws Europe, right? Like what are the sort of knock-on effects in other places in the world?

Alan Beattie
I mean, it does. I don’t think they’re using a very good example there. As they say, there’s hardly any Chinese steel in the US anyway. But yeah, there are a bunch of low-cost steel producers — India and Turkey and so on. And if steel is kept out, then you do get it washing around. And so everyone then starts putting on tariffs to protect their workers.

Now, Europe is nothing like as in hock to its steel industry as the US is. And in fact, I’m told that again, the Americans kept saying to the Europeans, why don’t you put these higher steel tariffs on? The Europeans are like, it’s a bad idea. And like, but your steel industry has told you they want it. And they appear to be utterly baffled by the idea that you wouldn’t instantly do what your steel industry told you to do.

Robert Armstrong
(Laughter) Is there any chance, Alan, that the rest of the world, as it were, rejects the approach that the US has taken and starts to trade more freely with one another, isolating the United States before its tariff walls?

Alan Beattie
So that would be ideal. And, you know, it’s not impossible and it is kind of happening. One funny thing is that the US is quite a closed economy, by which I don’t mean they have very high tariffs, but they . . . 

Robert Armstrong
Make a lot of their own stuff.

Alan Beattie
Make a lot of its own stuff. It’s got food, it’s got all sorts of stuff. They produce a lot of things. So although it’s, you know, what is it, quarter or so of the world economy? It’s only 15, 16 per cent of global imports so it’s not that important. And that could be squeezed out. So, yeah, they could trade a lot with each other.

One of the problems that the rest of the world has is that what you really need is someone to do the final consumption, right? So China can sell stuff to Malaysia. They can sell stuff on to Indonesia. You have a whole factory production so you need someone to do the final consuming. And until now, that’s often been the US. The US has a bigger proportion of actual final demand.

The question is who’s gonna do that consuming? Because this comes at a really bad time when China has actually shifted back to its export-led growth model because its domestic demand is in such a mess because of the property bubble and all the rest of it. So somebody said to me the other day, there’s a battle of competing mercantilisms, right? You have the US and China both trying to export. So, I mean, yeah, they absolutely can do this, but this would be an excellent time for the EU to do some more consumption. It would be an excellent time, in fact, for China to try and build a consumption model. But it hasn’t come at a great time from that point of view.

Katie Martin
To your mind, Alan, like, you have been covering this stuff for a really long time. Is it worth almost chasing every headline on this? Because so far we’ve had tariffs put on Colombia, tariffs taken off Colombia a few hours later. We’ve had the threat of tariffs against Canada and Mexico. That was taken off before they even started. We’ve, you know, we have got the additional tariffs against China, but it just feels, you know, like you’re just like chasing your tail at this point. Like how much of this policy that we’ve heard so far do you think is actually going to materialise in real life or do you think this is all just a massive exercise at keeping you busy?

Alan Beattie
I mean, obviously, nobody knows anything. (Laughter) I keep saying this to people and I don’t think it gets less irritating any time I said it. If anything, more irritating each time I say it. I think this is an excellent time to be a columnist and a really bad time to be a news reporter because, yeah, if you’re a news reporter, you have to chase this stuff. I mean, you have to.

One interesting thing, I think, you’ve not seen massive market reaction.

Katie Martin
No.

Alan Beattie
I mean, if they’re serious about this reciprocal stuff, right, that tears up the entire postwar trading order, which is all based on, you know, you offer the same tariff to everyone, goes for every nation, not individually. And it could lead to really massive ties and dislocation. And not just that, it’s just sort of, you know, (inaudible) of an administration that kind of doesn’t know what it’s doing and is out of control. But the markets don’t seem to be pricing that in.

Katie Martin
No.

Robert Armstrong
And I think part of it, you put your finger on it before where markets are in wait-and-see mode. They’re not discounting the event. They’re just waiting to see what will happen, right? That’s point number one.

Point number two, and I’d very much like to hear your view on this, Alan, is that people are making the assumption that companies, especially big companies, can be quite clever about adjusting to tariffs and protecting their profit margins and their earnings in the face of tariffs. Is that our experience of tariffs in the past, that kind of corporate economies re-form in a new way and business goes on? Or is that naive and hopeful?

Alan Beattie
It is. No, it is given what we’ve seen so far. So, I mean, in the Trump I administration, he did put a bunch of tariffs on . . . Big tariffs on China in particular, and also these steel and aluminium tariffs, but big tariffs on China. And all that happened is supply chains reorganised themselves. So instead of China exporting to the US, they exported through Vietnam either just, you know, shuffling it through Vietnam warehouses or they did actually move some of the value added there. And so you had countries, the IMF calls them connected countries, like Vietnam and Mexico and so on, who did very well. So, yeah, supply chains have been amazingly fair.

And as I always say to people, I have been doing this on and off for a long time and I’m continually hearing people writing off globalisation, right, and I’ve actually sort of kept a list in my head of the things which were definitely gonna end globalisation — bursting of the first tech bubble at the end of the 2000s; 9/11, that was definitely gonna end globalisation, right? (Inaudible) The Sars and avian flu outbreaks in the 2000s; the global food crisis, definitely; the global financial crisis, obviously; the Icelandic ash cloud?

Katie Martin
That was a good one.

Alan Beattie
That’s one for the hipsters. Now that is one for the globalisation hipsters. That was totally gonna do it. Trump was gonna do it, and then Covid was gonna do it. The massive surge of inflation was gonna do it. And nonetheless, it slowed. But I don’t think it’s actually much to do with those shocks. But goods trade has actually carried on. It’s extraordinarily resilient. I just got this vision in my mind of all of these shocks being like Wile E Coyote and the global economy, the goods trade being the Road Runner and he just tries to drop anvils on them and blows themselves up with Acme explosives. And at the end of all of these episodes, it’s just, “Beep. Beep”. (Robert laughs) And the Road Runner’s still going.

Robert Armstrong
Well, I pity the poor Wall Street strategists, right, are out there and they are . . . 

Alan Beattie
I’m trying hard to feel sympathy for the Wall Street strategists.

Katie Martin
Be nice.

Robert Armstrong
Yeah. No, they are forced to make some kind of back-in-the-envelope calculation, you know. If there are 25 per cent universal tariffs, how much will S&P 500 earnings per share change? And they say, OK, per cent of global trade and then input costs and then multiply by the thing. And the whole model is about eight lines long and they come out and they say 6 per cent, eureka! I just don’t believe a word of it.

Alan Beattie
Six per cent plus or minus 10 percentage points.

Robert Armstrong
(Laughter) Yeah. Exactly. I just don’t . . . It’s sort of one of those things. It’s like you have to wait and see how the great plastic organism that is the corporate economy re-forms in the face of this stuff.

Katie Martin
So little thought experiment for you. Say someone was successful in reducing a trade deficit to zero. That might sound like a nice number, but what would it actually mean in real life?

Alan Beattie
Well, the way you would do this without having sort of massive dislocation is to recognise this is a macro issue. It’s not a trade issue. You run current account deficits because you don’t save enough. So if you got saving up on investment, saving investment balance back into balance, then you could do it gradually. The mad thing is if you try and do it with trade because all that happens, for a start, all you have is your currency would tend to go up. It wouldn’t really work.

The only way it would work is by crunching back domestic demand. That’s how you would stop. You would say, we’re not gonna import anything any more. And the effect of that would be that the economy would really slow. The aim of it, of course, is to say all this stuff that’s being produced overseas, we produce here.

The problem is you can’t just instantly move stuff overseas to here. Apart from the tariffs, you might not be very good at it. It might be very expensive. So what is likely to happen instead is just that you bring the whole capacity of the economy right down enough to reduce the trade deficit, which means a massive, massive crunching recession.

Katie Martin
Yeah, sounds not ideal. To wrap up, Alan, I wanna ask you like, one last question. Like, imagine you are Johnny on the spot, right? You are in charge of the UK and European response to what Trump is currently fleshing out as his trade policy. In like a sentence, what is your advice to the governments?

Alan Beattie
You need to do something. What Mexico and Canada did was smart because they moved quickly. They — and it’s hard for the EU in particular to do that. I think you need to have something which can respond as quickly as possible. Canada and Mexico got to the point where at the moment Trump was gonna put the 25 per cent tariffs on at a minute past midnight on Tuesday, they could have retaliated immediately, right? Now, they had presidential authority in Mexico and the constitutional authority in Canada, which the EU doesn’t do. The EU moves much more slowly. But I think just preparing something, something which looks quite scary . . . 

Katie Martin
So think smart. Think quickly, but like, be ready to respond.

Alan Beattie
Yes. Essentially, be ready to respond. Because at the moment when he puts the tariffs on, you want to, in his mind, to be, OK, this has a cost.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Katie Martin
Right. Look, that is more than one sentence. But I’m gonna let you off because we have borrowed your brain. We’re gonna be back in a sec with Long/Short.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Alrighty. It’s time for Long/Short, that part of the show where we go long a thing we love or short a thing we hate.

I will go first. I am long eggs. Go yolk or go broke, folks. That’s what I say. So apparently the cost of a dozen eggs in America, the wholesale price is $8. Like, egg prices have gone completely bananas. They are quite literally expensive. Bird flu, the whole thing. This is very much a pocketbook issue, as they say in the States. And I see riots on the street about these here egg prices.

Robert Armstrong
I’ll follow up on that. Because of eggs, among many other macroeggonomic (Katie laughs) factors, I am long the neutral rate of interest. We were having this debate in the Unhedged newsletter and lots of places. It was particularly intense a year or two ago. Like, is the the kind of neutral rate, the kind of ambient level of interest rates in the economy going up? And just judging by the recent inflation reports and the kinds of, you know, a whole lot of other factors, it does seem like we hit an inflection point and the neutral interest rate is going higher. We’re not going back back to the days of 0 to 1.5 per cent rates.

Katie Martin
I blame eggs. So, Alan, you can’t have eggs and you can’t have interest rates. What are you long or short of?

Alan Beattie
I’m disappointed I can’t have eggs because I had a whole thing about shell companies ready to go but then again. I mean, I’m just gonna go for the classic. For about 20 years now, I have been publicly, very publicly short the giant panda.

Katie Martin
Yes. It’s one of your defining opinions.

Alan Beattie
It really is. Somebody actually said that will be my epitaph. Here lies Alan Beattie. He hated pandas. Simple as that. (Robert laughs) And you know, they can’t, they don’t eat the right thing . . . 

Robert Armstrong
What’s wrong with pandas? They’re cute.

Alan Beattie
They can’t eat. They pretend to be cute, Rob, but only people like you — see, he’s not my boss any more. They’re no good at reproducing. (Robert laughs) They eat the wrong stuff. They have way too much money and attention lavished on them. They’re useless. Short the panda.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Katie Martin
Yeah. Short pandas. That’s what we get Alan Beattie on the podcast for, boys and girls. Alan, it’s been an absolute pleasure. Next time trade policy goes bananas, we’ll get you on again. Rob, pleasure doing business with you as usual. Listeners, we will be back in your ears on Tuesday.

Look, we try not to talk about Donald Trump on this show all the time but, you know, two things. One, he’s the leader of the free world. Two, he has a whole bunch of economic policies up his sleeve that matter enormously to markets and that is very much our jam. And the latest curveball has landed on the market for metals. [MUSIC PLAYING]  The president wants a massive 25 per cent tax on all US imports of steel and aluminium, or aluminum, if you prefer, wherever it comes from — China, Europe, UK, whatever. This has sent metals markets a little bit bananas. Today on the show, we’re breaking down for you what is going on here, why we should all care, and how this fits into the broader trade strategy. This is Unhedged, the markets and finance podcast from the Financial Times and Pushkin. I’m Katie Martin, a markets columnist at the FT in London, and I’m joined by a dynamic duo today. In the blue corner down the line from New York City, the bruiser from the Unhedged newser, Rob Armstrong. Robert Armstrong
Greetings. Katie Martin
But also, in the red corner, a newbie on this podcast, the undisputed heavyweight trade nerd of the FT, Alan Beattie, here in the London studio with me. Alan, welcome to the show. Alan Beattie
Thank you. Why am I in the red corner? Katie Martin
I don’t know. Alan Beattie
OK. Katie Martin
So, look, all these years you’ve been nerding out on trade and now suddenly, like, are these the best of days or the worst of days for you? Alan Beattie
Someone in the trade world said it’s kind of like we’ve all been working in this quiet corner of the library. Nobody’s bothered us. No one else wanted to take those books out. And suddenly the doors open, all these people crash in and pulling books off the shelves and all the rest of it. You’ve got to suppress the temptation just to go, “Sssh!” (Robert laughs) Katie Martin
Yeah. And also, these are my books. Get out of here. Alan Beattie
Get out of here. Instead of which, you’ve got to try to open up, turn around and go, let me tell you about tariffs. Katie Martin
Now, children, sit down while I explain to you what is going on. So let’s start with the metal stuff. What is the latest proposal and is it serious? Alan Beattie
There’s a thing I always say about trade under Donald Trump, which is what the screenwriter William Goldman, who wrote The Princess Bride, among other things, said, which is in Hollywood, nobody knows anything. Nobody knows anything. Because with Trump, he thinks about five contradictory things. He has about eight people around him who also think things that contradict each other and indeed themselves. So who knows? What is true is that, you know, he did put on steel and aluminium tariffs in his first term, 25 per cent for steel and 10 per cent for aluminium. Now, he suspended a bunch of those. Biden negotiated some sort of suspensions and loopholes and so forth. But he does have form in putting them on. Katie Martin
Yeah. So there’s all sorts of like, little kind of loopholes and exemptions and whatnot that came in the last administration. And now he’s saying, right, all that is gone; 25 per cent on everything. Robert Armstrong
Alan, why steel and aluminium? Why not pears and stuffed animals, if you know what I mean? Why this? Alan Beattie
It’s always, always steel. Steel screws up the entire global trading system for everyone else. I annoy people massively when I say this and actually, we have people from the Biden administration saying, Alan, if you understood the lives of steel workers, you know, you might not be so dismissive about it; pointed out to them I grew up 10 miles away from a steel mill. I know what steel mills are. They’d grown up about 600 miles away from a steel mill. This is why I had no friends in the Biden administration. But it is a symbol of industrial strength. It’s a symbol of manufacturing. Katie Martin
It’s men doing things in hot places with big hammers and stuff. Alan Beattie
We all think steel is cool. It’s also really concentrated. You know, if a steel mill closes down, as it did near me, and you get three, four, five, 6,000 jobs gone bang in a day, that’s really dramatic in a way that, you know, losing jobs across the service sector is not. Robert Armstrong
It’s not only dramatic. It attaches to a very specific political power centre. That representative, that senator whatever, you know, has a serious bone to pick. Alan Beattie
That’s certainly true in the US. Not everywhere, but certainly in the US. You know, that’s the other thing. Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, these are the swing states. I mean, it’s absolutely true that the Biden administration, Katherine Tai, according to people who had spoken to her, they told me that she or certainly USTR, explicitly said to them, you’ve got to help us win Pennsylvania. You’ve got to give us what we want on steel because you’ve got to help us win Pennsylvania. Katie Martin
Right. So it’s almost like an emotional issue and it’s a very political issue. Alan Beattie
It’s very emotional. It’s very political. It’s very symbolic. And I say it’s been screwing up the trading system for decades. Robert Armstrong
I think listeners are probably familiar with the standard argument against steel tariffs that whatever you gain in terms of steel jobs, you lose in terms of other manufacturing jobs by making input costs in industries that make things out of steel higher. Alan Beattie
That’s absolutely true. The estimates are something like 80 jobs in downstream steel-using industries for every job in steel. Robert Armstrong
Yeah. So it’s terrible. I’m interested to hear the kind of worldwide or geopolitical implications of this and indeed the whole Trump tariff set. What is the rest of the world? How much does it matter to them? What are they gonna do in response? What is the state of play in terms of responses from the rest of the world? Katie Martin
You are stealing all of my questions. Robert Armstrong
OK. I’m sorry. I’m just curious. I’m a curious man. We have an expert here. I’m just pushing ahead with the discussion, Katie. Katie Martin
(Laughter) Go for it. Alan Beattie
So if this was only metals, right, I don’t think everyone would be as quite as alarmed as they are because, you know, as I say, there’s always a lot of stuff about steel and metals and so on. For example, there’s almost no Chinese steel actually circulating in the US because there’s so much effort has been made to keep it out with various tariffs or so forth. It’s not just that. It’s the fact that Trump is trying to use tariffs for a whole bunch of other reasons, right? He suddenly comes up with these coercive tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Twenty-five per cent tariffs are going to be implemented in, what was it, 72 hours to stop an almost non-existent flow of fentanyl across the Canadian border and to encourage them to do stuff on immigration they’re already doing. For Mexico and Canada that’s enormous. Katie Martin
And that’s just delayed, right? In theory, that’s still happening. Alan Beattie
And still that’s delayed until March the 4th. So who knows whether they will come up with something else to buy him off? I think they’ve already appointed a fentanyl tsar. So I don’t know if they just . . . I don’t know how you escalate that. Maybe a fentanyl emperor or a vizier. (Robert and Katie laugh) You know something? I wouldn’t like to be . . . I’d like to be a grand vizier of fentanyl. We won’t actually like to do the work. Just do a little bit of advice. Katie Martin
It’d look great on your LinkedIn. Alan Beattie
Look weird, wouldn’t it? (Laughter) Robert Armstrong
First fentanyl lord. (Laughter) Katie Martin
But all things being equal, right? Like, so say this happens, right, the steel tariffs. Then what is the impact on industry? Because as you say, like, it’s great if you happen to be a steelworker. It’s not that great if you happen to be someone who makes cars or puts food in cans for a living, right? Alan Beattie
That’s right. It will hit the car industry. It will hit all of those industries. But the thing is, it doesn’t hit any of them dramatically enough that they really complain that much. You know, I’ve always wondered, why does the car industry in America not complain more given that it is one of its basic inputs? And people always say, yeah, but the thing is, the car industry benefits a lot from what they call trade remedies, right, from blocks on cheap imports as well. So they don’t necessarily wanna bring the whole system down because they kind of benefit from it as well. Katie Martin
Right. But it’s just like a pain in the ass. So what we’re already seeing is that like, consumers of metals in the US — because the US is a net importer of these metals — they’re already paying a higher price for copper, for example, which isn’t in the current set of new tariff proposals, but probably will be. So they’re paying . . . Already, they’re paying a higher price for copper, aluminium and steel. I insist on keeping calling it aluminium. Robert Armstrong
Is that a different metal than aluminum? Is that like really good aluminum? Katie Martin
Yes, it’s posh aluminum. (Robert laughs) So they’re already paying what’s known as the Midwest premium to get hold of this metal because they wanna get ahead of these tariffs and buy these metals quicker. So yeah, I guess I kind of don’t get either why people are not up in arms and saying, what the hell? You’ve just raised our production costs. Robert Armstrong
I think Alan has given us part of the answer, which is that the benefits of tariffs are concentrated and the costs are diffused. Alan Beattie
This is true. And also they don’t actually know whether he’s gonna go ahead with them or not. You know, if you actually start throwing stuff out the pump. And also, do you want to cross Donald Trump? Really? We’ve seen what happens to people who crossed Donald Trump. It’s not very pleasant sometimes. So if you’re gonna actually really come out publicly and take a pop at the administration, you might want to wait until you’re sure these things are actually hit rather than look like a bit of an idiot by coming out, burning a whole load of bridges and it’s not gonna happen anyway. Robert Armstrong
How does the rest of the world respond, Alan? Strategically, what moves are they making and are they intelligent? Alan Beattie
So if we look more broadly, because it’s not just steel — and I won’t say aluminum, in deference to Rob. Rob used to be my boss. He told me to say aluminum. Katie Martin
Never show deference to Rob. Alan Beattie
He told me I would be fired if I didn’t say aluminum. (Robert laughs) But I mean, he was a vicious boss. He really was. You know. So they’re having to deal with a whole bunch of stuff, if you’re Canada and Mexico, you’re dealing with this 25 per cent. You’re dealing with the metals tariffs. You’re dealing with this wacky plan they’ve got for reciprocal tariffs. Katie Martin
I don’t understand what they are. Tell me what they are. Robert Armstrong
Yes, let’s have a pause to talk about reciprocal tariffs. This is an important point. Alan Beattie
Funnily enough, this is actually written down on his policy platform, his campaign platform, unlike most of this. Quite simply, you set the US tariffs equivalent to the product of any given trading partner. So if you are trading with the EU on cars, the US has a 2 or 2.5 per cent tariff on most cars — we’ll go on to that — and the EU has 10. So you say to the EU, right, either you cut your 10 per cent tariff to 2 or we raise our 2 per cent tariff to 10. So it’s just a tit for tat. Robert Armstrong
I have a question in the back. What about countries where things don’t match? Like we match kind of Europe in cars, but like with Colombia, we take their coffee and presumably their cocaine — but I don’t think there’s a cocaine tariff — and they take our whatever it is we send to them. I don’t know if it’s chicken or whatever we send. And so, like what they tariff us on coffee and what we tariff them on whatever it is we send to them presumably doesn’t matter to the other party. Alan Beattie
Shut up, Rob. Rob, shut up. Shut up. Shut up. (Robert laughs) Don’t tell them that, OK? They haven’t worked it out and it’s gonna be really funny when suddenly everyone’s drinking really expensive coffee or snorting really expensive coke. And it will have . . . And amazingly enough, the great coffee growers of the upper Wisconsin mountains . . .  Robert Armstrong
Exactly. Alan Beattie
 . . . do not, in fact, benefit from this. Exactly. You know, it’s not thought through for a bunch of reasons. The other reason it’s not thought through even more so is it’s kind of predicated on this idea that American tariffs are always lower, right? And Americans believe this. They believe they’re a free trade country. They’re taken advantage of by the rest of the world, blah blah blah. By and large, they are lower. There are a bunch of places, particularly in agriculture, they are very much not. So classic one being sugar, right? The cane growers down in Florida, politically very powerful. I think it’s now pretty well established that Bill Clinton, when he was enjoying private time in the Oval Office with Monica Lewinsky, took a call from the Florida sugar growers. That’s how important they are. Now, the tariffs on that sugar in the US are actually quite high. I got someone to run the numbers and they came up with numbers above 40 per cent. Katie Martin
What? Alan Beattie
Because, you know, if you are a rich country, that’s what you can afford to do. You basically say we can afford to protect this particular bunch of farmers who until quite recently were in a swing state. So that’s why they get that protection. Robert Armstrong
You wrote something about pick-up trucks, too. Is this another example of this? We tariff the foreign pick-up truck. Alan Beattie
This is the so-called chicken tax, which LBJ put on light trucks, including pick-up trucks from Europe, in a rage, in fact, from everywhere, in a rage, because Europeans put taxes, put tariffs on American chicken. That dispute, by the way, in a slightly different guise is still going on. So that’s a 25 per cent tariff on pick-up trucks. And I’m told that’s the only bit of Detroit that actually makes money. So let’s say the US does do this and it cuts its own tariffs, right, if it’s going to be fair. So it’s gonna cut its sugar tariffs down to Brazilian levels, which are like, I think, 16 per cent. And if Brazil has any wit, they’ll cut their tariffs to nil and then they’ll have a 0 per cent tariff. The US will be absolutely flooded with Brazilian sugar. Nobody grows sugar cheaper than the Brazilians. If they cut their light truck tariff from 25 per cent down to European levels, which are 10 per cent, with Europeans, which they’ve offered to do actually, cut their car tariffs down to 2 per cent, which are the American level, then suddenly Detroit loses all of its protection. So what you’ve got to assume is there’s gonna be a load of hypocrisy going on here where . . . I know. We’ve never seen it before in trade. Katie Martin
Say it ain’t so. Alan Beattie
We’ve never seen it before. But here it is. It’s very sad. I think it’s all these new people coming in. Katie Martin
It’s almost as if none of this stuff makes any sense, Alan. So let me ask you, what does this mean for the rest of the world in the sense that the German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp was saying if the US tariffs do come into effect, then what we’re gonna end up with is loads more Chinese steel flooding, if steel can flood, into the European market. And so it kind of screws Europe, right? Like what are the sort of knock-on effects in other places in the world? Alan Beattie
I mean, it does. I don’t think they’re using a very good example there. As they say, there’s hardly any Chinese steel in the US anyway. But yeah, there are a bunch of low-cost steel producers — India and Turkey and so on. And if steel is kept out, then you do get it washing around. And so everyone then starts putting on tariffs to protect their workers. Now, Europe is nothing like as in hock to its steel industry as the US is. And in fact, I’m told that again, the Americans kept saying to the Europeans, why don’t you put these higher steel tariffs on? The Europeans are like, it’s a bad idea. And like, but your steel industry has told you they want it. And they appear to be utterly baffled by the idea that you wouldn’t instantly do what your steel industry told you to do. Robert Armstrong
(Laughter) Is there any chance, Alan, that the rest of the world, as it were, rejects the approach that the US has taken and starts to trade more freely with one another, isolating the United States before its tariff walls? Alan Beattie
So that would be ideal. And, you know, it’s not impossible and it is kind of happening. One funny thing is that the US is quite a closed economy, by which I don’t mean they have very high tariffs, but they . . .  Robert Armstrong
Make a lot of their own stuff. Alan Beattie
Make a lot of its own stuff. It’s got food, it’s got all sorts of stuff. They produce a lot of things. So although it’s, you know, what is it, quarter or so of the world economy? It’s only 15, 16 per cent of global imports so it’s not that important. And that could be squeezed out. So, yeah, they could trade a lot with each other. One of the problems that the rest of the world has is that what you really need is someone to do the final consumption, right? So China can sell stuff to Malaysia. They can sell stuff on to Indonesia. You have a whole factory production so you need someone to do the final consuming. And until now, that’s often been the US. The US has a bigger proportion of actual final demand. The question is who’s gonna do that consuming? Because this comes at a really bad time when China has actually shifted back to its export-led growth model because its domestic demand is in such a mess because of the property bubble and all the rest of it. So somebody said to me the other day, there’s a battle of competing mercantilisms, right? You have the US and China both trying to export. So, I mean, yeah, they absolutely can do this, but this would be an excellent time for the EU to do some more consumption. It would be an excellent time, in fact, for China to try and build a consumption model. But it hasn’t come at a great time from that point of view. Katie Martin
To your mind, Alan, like, you have been covering this stuff for a really long time. Is it worth almost chasing every headline on this? Because so far we’ve had tariffs put on Colombia, tariffs taken off Colombia a few hours later. We’ve had the threat of tariffs against Canada and Mexico. That was taken off before they even started. We’ve, you know, we have got the additional tariffs against China, but it just feels, you know, like you’re just like chasing your tail at this point. Like how much of this policy that we’ve heard so far do you think is actually going to materialise in real life or do you think this is all just a massive exercise at keeping you busy? Alan Beattie
I mean, obviously, nobody knows anything. (Laughter) I keep saying this to people and I don’t think it gets less irritating any time I said it. If anything, more irritating each time I say it. I think this is an excellent time to be a columnist and a really bad time to be a news reporter because, yeah, if you’re a news reporter, you have to chase this stuff. I mean, you have to. One interesting thing, I think, you’ve not seen massive market reaction. Katie Martin
No. Alan Beattie
I mean, if they’re serious about this reciprocal stuff, right, that tears up the entire postwar trading order, which is all based on, you know, you offer the same tariff to everyone, goes for every nation, not individually. And it could lead to really massive ties and dislocation. And not just that, it’s just sort of, you know, (inaudible) of an administration that kind of doesn’t know what it’s doing and is out of control. But the markets don’t seem to be pricing that in. Katie Martin
No. Robert Armstrong
And I think part of it, you put your finger on it before where markets are in wait-and-see mode. They’re not discounting the event. They’re just waiting to see what will happen, right? That’s point number one. Point number two, and I’d very much like to hear your view on this, Alan, is that people are making the assumption that companies, especially big companies, can be quite clever about adjusting to tariffs and protecting their profit margins and their earnings in the face of tariffs. Is that our experience of tariffs in the past, that kind of corporate economies re-form in a new way and business goes on? Or is that naive and hopeful? Alan Beattie
It is. No, it is given what we’ve seen so far. So, I mean, in the Trump I administration, he did put a bunch of tariffs on . . . Big tariffs on China in particular, and also these steel and aluminium tariffs, but big tariffs on China. And all that happened is supply chains reorganised themselves. So instead of China exporting to the US, they exported through Vietnam either just, you know, shuffling it through Vietnam warehouses or they did actually move some of the value added there. And so you had countries, the IMF calls them connected countries, like Vietnam and Mexico and so on, who did very well. So, yeah, supply chains have been amazingly fair. And as I always say to people, I have been doing this on and off for a long time and I’m continually hearing people writing off globalisation, right, and I’ve actually sort of kept a list in my head of the things which were definitely gonna end globalisation — bursting of the first tech bubble at the end of the 2000s; 9/11, that was definitely gonna end globalisation, right? (Inaudible) The Sars and avian flu outbreaks in the 2000s; the global food crisis, definitely; the global financial crisis, obviously; the Icelandic ash cloud? Katie Martin
That was a good one. Alan Beattie
That’s one for the hipsters. Now that is one for the globalisation hipsters. That was totally gonna do it. Trump was gonna do it, and then Covid was gonna do it. The massive surge of inflation was gonna do it. And nonetheless, it slowed. But I don’t think it’s actually much to do with those shocks. But goods trade has actually carried on. It’s extraordinarily resilient. I just got this vision in my mind of all of these shocks being like Wile E Coyote and the global economy, the goods trade being the Road Runner and he just tries to drop anvils on them and blows themselves up with Acme explosives. And at the end of all of these episodes, it’s just, “Beep. Beep”. (Robert laughs) And the Road Runner’s still going. Robert Armstrong
Well, I pity the poor Wall Street strategists, right, are out there and they are . . .  Alan Beattie
I’m trying hard to feel sympathy for the Wall Street strategists. Katie Martin
Be nice. Robert Armstrong
Yeah. No, they are forced to make some kind of back-in-the-envelope calculation, you know. If there are 25 per cent universal tariffs, how much will S&P 500 earnings per share change? And they say, OK, per cent of global trade and then input costs and then multiply by the thing. And the whole model is about eight lines long and they come out and they say 6 per cent, eureka! I just don’t believe a word of it. Alan Beattie
Six per cent plus or minus 10 percentage points. Robert Armstrong
(Laughter) Yeah. Exactly. I just don’t . . . It’s sort of one of those things. It’s like you have to wait and see how the great plastic organism that is the corporate economy re-forms in the face of this stuff. Katie Martin
So little thought experiment for you. Say someone was successful in reducing a trade deficit to zero. That might sound like a nice number, but what would it actually mean in real life? Alan Beattie
Well, the way you would do this without having sort of massive dislocation is to recognise this is a macro issue. It’s not a trade issue. You run current account deficits because you don’t save enough. So if you got saving up on investment, saving investment balance back into balance, then you could do it gradually. The mad thing is if you try and do it with trade because all that happens, for a start, all you have is your currency would tend to go up. It wouldn’t really work. The only way it would work is by crunching back domestic demand. That’s how you would stop. You would say, we’re not gonna import anything any more. And the effect of that would be that the economy would really slow. The aim of it, of course, is to say all this stuff that’s being produced overseas, we produce here. The problem is you can’t just instantly move stuff overseas to here. Apart from the tariffs, you might not be very good at it. It might be very expensive. So what is likely to happen instead is just that you bring the whole capacity of the economy right down enough to reduce the trade deficit, which means a massive, massive crunching recession. Katie Martin
Yeah, sounds not ideal. To wrap up, Alan, I wanna ask you like, one last question. Like, imagine you are Johnny on the spot, right? You are in charge of the UK and European response to what Trump is currently fleshing out as his trade policy. In like a sentence, what is your advice to the governments? Alan Beattie
You need to do something. What Mexico and Canada did was smart because they moved quickly. They — and it’s hard for the EU in particular to do that. I think you need to have something which can respond as quickly as possible. Canada and Mexico got to the point where at the moment Trump was gonna put the 25 per cent tariffs on at a minute past midnight on Tuesday, they could have retaliated immediately, right? Now, they had presidential authority in Mexico and the constitutional authority in Canada, which the EU doesn’t do. The EU moves much more slowly. But I think just preparing something, something which looks quite scary . . .  Katie Martin
So think smart. Think quickly, but like, be ready to respond. Alan Beattie Yes. Essentially, be ready to respond. Because at the moment when he puts the tariffs on, you want to, in his mind, to be, OK, this has a cost.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Katie Martin Right. Look, that is more than one sentence. But I’m gonna let you off because we have borrowed your brain. We’re gonna be back in a sec with Long/Short.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  Alrighty. It’s time for Long/Short, that part of the show where we go long a thing we love or short a thing we hate. I will go first. I am long eggs. Go yolk or go broke, folks. That’s what I say. So apparently the cost of a dozen eggs in America, the wholesale price is $8. Like, egg prices have gone completely bananas. They are quite literally expensive. Bird flu, the whole thing. This is very much a pocketbook issue, as they say in the States. And I see riots on the street about these here egg prices. Robert Armstrong
I’ll follow up on that. Because of eggs, among many other macroeggonomic (Katie laughs) factors, I am long the neutral rate of interest. We were having this debate in the Unhedged newsletter and lots of places. It was particularly intense a year or two ago. Like, is the the kind of neutral rate, the kind of ambient level of interest rates in the economy going up? And just judging by the recent inflation reports and the kinds of, you know, a whole lot of other factors, it does seem like we hit an inflection point and the neutral interest rate is going higher. We’re not going back back to the days of 0 to 1.5 per cent rates. Katie Martin
I blame eggs. So, Alan, you can’t have eggs and you can’t have interest rates. What are you long or short of? Alan Beattie
I’m disappointed I can’t have eggs because I had a whole thing about shell companies ready to go but then again. I mean, I’m just gonna go for the classic. For about 20 years now, I have been publicly, very publicly short the giant panda. Katie Martin
Yes. It’s one of your defining opinions. Alan Beattie
It really is. Somebody actually said that will be my epitaph. Here lies Alan Beattie. He hated pandas. Simple as that. (Robert laughs) And you know, they can’t, they don’t eat the right thing . . .  Robert Armstrong
What’s wrong with pandas? They’re cute. Alan Beattie They can’t eat. They pretend to be cute, Rob, but only people like you — see, he’s not my boss any more. They’re no good at reproducing. (Robert laughs) They eat the wrong stuff. They have way too much money and attention lavished on them. They’re useless. Short the panda.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Katie Martin
Yeah. Short pandas. That’s what we get Alan Beattie on the podcast for, boys and girls. Alan, it’s been an absolute pleasure. Next time trade policy goes bananas, we’ll get you on again.

[MUSIC PLAYING]",2025-02-13,This is an audio transcript of the Unhedged podcast episode,"In this episode of the Unhedged podcast, host Katie Martin discusses President Trump's proposed 25% tax on all US imports of steel and aluminum, a move that has significantly impacted metal markets. Experts Rob Armstrong and Alan Beattie contribute insights into the proposal's implications for trade.

Alan explains that steel and aluminum tariffs are politically charged due to their effect on specific jobs and industries, notably manufacturing. While these tariffs may help steelworkers, they often raise costs for others, particularly in sectors like automotive manufacturing, which rely on metals.

The podcast also covers the broader geopolitical ramifications. If the US implements these tariffs, it could lead to increased global tensions and retaliatory actions from other countries. Armstrong notes that while the US may be attempting to use tariffs as a trade strategy, these decisions are fraught with uncertainty, as the effects are complex and can disrupt existing trade relationships.

Additionally, the discussion touches on the idea of ""reciprocal tariffs,"" where the US would raise tariffs on countries with higher tariffs on American goods, which could further complicate international trade. Beattie warns that the unpredictable nature of Trump's administration makes it challenging to anticipate the final outcomes of these trade policies.

In summary, the podcast emphasizes the intricate relationship between tariffs, employment, and international trade dynamics, highlighting that while tariffs may aim to protect certain industries, they can create broader economic repercussions."

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Katie Martin
The hottest asset on the planet right now is not some fancy tech stock or even a super soaraway memecoin. It’s gold. People are desperate to get their hands on the stuff. It’s up like 10 per cent this year, even though some of the things we normally look at elsewhere in markets that tell us what gold is gonna do are not really pointing that way. So today on the show we’re asking what is going on with this thing?

This is Unhedged, the markets and finance podcast from the Financial Times and Pushkin. I’m Katie Martin, a markets columnist at the FT in London. And typically, I’ve got to say, I’m not much of a gold bug, but I bow down to the performance of this most ancient of assets. And speaking of ancient, guess who’s back?

Robert Armstrong
(Laughter) I didn’t see that coming.

Katie Martin
(Laughter) It’s Rob Armstrong of the Unhedged newsletter.

Robert Armstrong
The only asset more ancient than gold — Rob Armstrong, financial commentator. Oh, dear.

Katie Martin
Yes. I figured that joke might need work, but turns out it worked pretty well. But how are you doing? You’ve been away. You’ve been outside of New York City. Were there dragons?

Robert Armstrong
I recently went to Arizona, beautiful Arizona, for an investment conference and talked to a lot of people who manage endowment and foundation money.

Katie Martin
Big money.

Robert Armstrong
And let me tell you, they are as puzzled as the rest of us about what is going on in the world right now. You know, it’s funny. People who run like, a university’s money, they have an office of three people or whatever and they’re running like $1bn or $2bn. And they outsource all this stuff. So they find outside managers to do it. But still, they have to decide which manager and what to allocate to which assets. And these people are all overwhelmed anyway. And this period of time is very overwhelming for them because they feel they should do something in response to all the weird changes going on in the world. But they don’t know what it is. So I say welcome to the party, endowment manager.

Katie Martin
You know, you ask the experts like, what’s going on and they say, like, you tell me.

Robert Armstrong
(Laughter) I have no idea.

Katie Martin
The scary thought is maybe they’re figuring it out from this podcast.

Robert Armstrong
But this brings us precisely to the question of gold, which is the asset which you buy when you feel uncertain about things, right?

Katie Martin
Yes. When bad stuff happens, gold goes up. When people are worried about the state of the world, gold goes up. Gold is up right now.

Robert Armstrong
I think we should be a bit more specific about that. It’s only when things . . . Historically, the only time gold really outperforms your normal financial assets like stocks or bonds or whatever is when things are really bad. Like in proper crises is when gold really is a useful diversifier and hedge. When things are only mildly bad it’s actually a terrible asset to own.

Katie Martin
But look, let’s just talk about what it’s done so far this year. As I mentioned, it’s up 10 per cent year to date. And like, last time I checked, it’s still only February. That’s quite a lot.

Robert Armstrong
Yeah, it’s a big move on top of earlier big moves.

Katie Martin
Yeah. So it’s up 40 per cent since the start of 2024. We are now at something like $2,900 an ounce. Ye gods. That’s a big number.

Robert Armstrong
It’s basically doubled since late 2022. It’s a really impressive run.

Katie Martin
Very impressive. So when you’re talking about gold, yes, very obviously it is a metal.

Robert Armstrong
Yeah. It’s not a vegetable.

Katie Martin
I’m no scientist, but I know this much. But it doesn’t move around based on the sorts of things that other metals move around because its industrial uses are not the main driver of the price. So it’s more of a kind a...

Robert Armstrong
Yes, there are industrial uses for this stuff, but most of the demand comes from jewellery/investment demand. And in some parts of the world those two are the same thing.

But you know what was weird about the run in gold that went from, say, early 2024 to kind of the fall of last year, is that the usual things that kind of moved the gold price, which are the real interest rate — that is the interest rate after inflation — and the dollar — because gold is priced in dollars, when the dollar strengthens, the gold price usually goes down. Those things which usually allow you to navigate the gold price — you know, understand the gold price a little bit. Those things are actually going the other direction. In other words, real yields were going up, increasing the opportunity price of owning gold, which should in theory make gold go down. And yet gold went up. And the dollar was getting stronger, which should create pressure on gold. And yet gold was going up.

Now, however, in this latest 2025 rally, at least those things are all going the direction they’re supposed to go. Real yields have come down. The dollar has, quite surprisingly in recent weeks, weakened when everybody thought it was gonna strengthen. And gold has responded the way gold is supposed to respond. So yay for this tiny shred of economic logic in what is happening lately to gold.

Katie Martin
There is a little bit of logic, but there has been a break in the logic as well. So going back to your point about real yields. So the whole point of gold is if you hold it as an asset, it is a pet rock, right? This thing does not pay you dividends like a lot of stocks do. It doesn’t pay you any sort of return like a bond does. It’s just a nice shiny rock and it goes up in price or it goes down in price. And so normally when yields are high, when bond yields are high, particularly in relation to inflation, people say, I don’t need gold in my portfolio, it doesn’t pay me anything. I may as well own these bonds instead. But that is not what’s been going on recently so it is a bit of a head-scratcher.

Robert Armstrong
Yeah. Yields are higher and real yields still are high. But we should make the distinction between the level and the rate of change. And the level is still high, but, you know, the rate of change is at least in the last few weeks, going gold’s direction.

We should also talk about, you know, why else gold might be in demand right now, right? And this brings us to every gold bug’s favourite story, which is kind of the de-dollarisation story. If the global reserve currency, which is the dollar, is something you don’t wanna hold any more, then the natural substitute — because goodness knows you don’t wanna hold Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollars, God help you the euro — is to go to what is sometimes thought of as a currency in gold. So is de-dollarisation part of the story here, a move away from the dollar part of the story here?

Katie Martin
I’m not sure it’s quite de-dollarisation, but there is definitely something going on whereby official reserve holders, right, which is like this sort of catch-all term that encompasses like big sovereign wealth funds and central banks around the world and other kind of government-related stores of national wealth around the world. One thing you can definitely see is that they have, particularly actually since the election of Donald Trump, they have pulled back from US government bonds. And instead, so they’re not saying, right, we’re gonna put our reserves in Chinese renminbi, because that’s got certain issues around it, around whether you can get the money out again. They’re not necessarily saying we’re gonna put our money into euros and government bonds because, again, the euro is a bit of a, you know, a problematic currency for those big long-term managers of money because it’s just . . . It’s got some structural flaws. You know, the euro is a big slice of these reserves. But still, we digress.

But what they are doing is saying, I don’t necessarily need any sort of bonds in my portfolio here. I’m gonna put the money into gold. And so we’re seeing quite a lot of gold purchases from central banks around the world. And that is kind of interesting, right?

Robert Armstrong
Right. I mean, there’s two related reasons a central bank might buy gold. One is that you think holding treasuries, US Treasuries, which is the kind of natural way to hold the dollar, is no longer a good idea. Maybe you think the US is gonna become a fiscal basket case or whatever.

The other reason is because dollars and dollar assets come with strings attached. If you accumulate as reserves dollars or dollar-based assets, you are vulnerable to US sanctions and you are subject to US political control. So you might say let me have a little gold in reserve so if I end up on the United States’s naughty list, I will still have an asset I can use to buy the things that I need.

Katie Martin
Now, the last big example of that happening, which is why stuff like real yields and the price of gold have diverged over the past few years. The last time that really happened in dramatic fashion was 2022. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the US, like, pulled the cord, right? It said, OK, we’re going to use the power invested in us through the dollar being the global reserve currency to freeze Russia out of the dollar system. It basically used its currency as a weapon. Now, so other countries around the world look at this and they think, I don’t want to be in the same boat. Now, one way to avoid being in the same boat is not to launch a war of aggression against neighbouring states. So . . .

Robert Armstrong
(Laughter) That’s one strategy, if you’re a wimp.

Katie Martin
It’s just not that difficult, to my mind, to avoid. But you do have a new president in the White House. He is a mercurial character, one might say. He’s a lot less predictable.

Robert Armstrong
That’s fair. Like him or not like him, you’re gonna use the word mercurial. Mercurial? Am I saying that right? I’m not even sure.

Katie Martin
Mercurial. Yes. Who knows what he might do with this power in the future? And so it does look like, if you look at the timing between central banks around the world reducing their treasury holdings, central banks around the world increasing their gold holdings, there does seem to be a bit of a correlation. So it’s not mad to theorise here that these two things are related and there is a bit of a demand for gold out there from governments around the world that don’t want to, as you say, get put on the US naughty step.

Robert Armstrong
The World Gold Council provides us with their estimates of gold purchases, net new gold purchases by central banks. This is for 2024. And your number one gold buyer with over 80 tonnes of gold purchased: Poland. Filling out the top five, which with quite a bit less than Poland, are Turkey, India, Azerbaijan and China. And those are by far the biggest new gold purchasers. China added 40-odd billion, I mean, 40-odd tonnes of gold, yes. It’s important in shows like this to get the units right. You end up sending extremely silly.

Katie Martin
Get your units right. Show you’re working.

Robert Armstrong
If you look at those five countries, they are either close to, in the sphere of influence of or are uneasy allies with Russia. So Poland, of course, a close neighbour and a close neighbour of Ukraine; Turkey, long a kind of bridge between the European west and the Russian east; Azerbaijan, very much in that neighbourhood as well. And both China and India have been an outlet for Russian energy, oil and gas under US sanctions. So their purchases of gold, heavy purchases of gold this year are not coincidental.

Katie Martin
Yeah. So the World Gold Council was saying that last year, so 2024, central banks added over a thousand tonnes of gold to their global reserves. And that’s the third year in a row it’s been over a thousand tonnes. And there’s been like a massive step change from pre-2022 to post-2022. So a thousand tonnes a year has become the new normal that you, like, really over the past sort of three years. But there’s definitely something going on around sanctions-proofing your reserves, which is just super interesting, although people buy it for different reasons, right? It’s security. It is a store of wealth.

Robert Armstrong
It’s a very emotional asset.

Katie Martin
It’s a very emotional asset. And it’s, you know, got a very long history behind it. So central banks buy it for, you know, whatever their motivations are. But the point is that they are buying in pretty substantial numbers.

Robert Armstrong
And have been, I should note, and have been for a couple of years now. It’s been not just the last couple of weeks or months that central banks have started to marginally move towards gold.

Katie Martin
But one thing that has really accelerated quite quickly is I’m sure you saw the story that we ran the other day from Leslie Hook, who writes about metals and commodities for us.

Robert Armstrong
Yes.

Katie Martin
And she was writing that there’s been a massive surge in shipments of gold to the US, creating a shortage of bullion in London. So there’s a huge stockpile of this stuff in New York. There’s a real kind of, you know, sucking noise as oil does sort of...

Robert Armstrong
 As it goes from one place to the other.

Katie Martin
Exactly. And one of the analysts that she quoted in the story was saying there’s a feeling that Trump could go across the board and impose new tariffs on raw materials coming into the US, including gold. And so people are trying to get ahead of that. And so all of a sudden, if you want to get your gold from the UK over to New York, then there’s quite a long waiting list actually, to make that happen. Quite an unusually long one.

Robert Armstrong
It really brings out how different this asset is. Gold is very heavy and when there is a financial, a global financial imbalance, such as an imbalance between the physical gold price in London and the gold futures price in New York, people actually take this heavy stuff and put it on an airplane and fly it over the ocean.

Katie Martin
Must cost a fortune. Yeah.

Robert Armstrong
To me, this is just astonishing that in our modern day and age we are closing what are essentially financial transactions by putting heavy metals on to planes and flying them across the ocean. And you know what is even weirder about this kind of New York-London arbitrage is that in order to deliver gold to either close a contract or just a transaction in the two markets, the gold has to be in different-shaped bars. So if you want to take London cash market gold and get it to New York, you first generally fly it to a refinery in Switzerland, melt it down into a different shape so it’s the shape that Comex exchanges will take in New York before you fly it. It just shows you this asset is not like the others. The other ones you’re just like, make a phone call. I’ll trade you this for that. Yes. OK. Hang up phone. Whole thing is over. The only thing that has moved is electrons.

Katie Martin
Yes. A number changed on a screen. Done.

Robert Armstrong
There’s no heavy stuff. There’s no vault. And so gold is just different.

Katie Martin
So normally, though, one of the things that’s bugging me about this is that when the gold price shoots higher, that’s because there’s some sort of war, pestilence, terrible thing, horsemen of the apocalypse. Something terrible is happening. So it is sort of strange that you’ve got this massive run-up in the price of gold while stocks are still doing pretty well and bonds are still doing relatively badly. Like, there is no sort of giant flight to safety going on that would normally be associated with a rise in the gold price that’s like this.

But one of the other super-weird things — everything about gold is super weird — but one super-weird thing that’s come up recently, there’s a column written by our colleague Gillian Tett, who was writing about I can’t even get my head around the scheme. So the US is sitting on enormous amounts of gold, right? The US government...

Robert Armstrong
It has gold reserves just like other countries do.

Katie Martin
And for reasons that escape me, this gold is valued at $42 an ounce because that’s what it . . . Was that when they . . . I don’t know. Why is it $42 an ounce?

Robert Armstrong
Yeah. My understanding of why the number for the official reserves is $42 an ounce is that is a frozen price dating back to when Nixon forbade us for trading dollars with gold with the US government. So that $42 nominal price is one of the many parts of Nixon’s legacy.

Katie Martin
And now there’s this idea that, again, for like weird accounting purposes, they might revalue it and say, $42 an ounce? No. That’ll be $2,800 an ounce. Thank you very much. And then all of a sudden it looks like the US is lots richer and that this appears to be one of the reasons this feeding into the rise in the gold price. Personally, I don’t get it.

Robert Armstrong
OK, so let me just read two brief paragraphs from Gillian’s article, because this stuff is so weird that you kind of have to write it down and then say it out loud: So currently, US reserves are valued at just $42 an ounce in the national accounts. But knowledgeable observers reckon that if they were marked at current values — $2,800 an ounce — this could inject $800bn into the Treasury general account via a repurchase agreement. That might reduce the need to issue quite so many treasuries this year. This week, such chatter intensified after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both pledged to monetise the asset side of the US balance sheet while also promising to lower 10-year Treasury yields.

Now, let’s just first be clear about what this is not. This is not the US government saying we actually have all this stuff that’s really valuable right now. Let’s sell some of it to reduce the national debt.

Katie Martin
No, because that would push the price down.

Robert Armstrong
Yeah, of course. That would add supply to the market and push the price down. So it can’t be that. And the keyword in that bit I just read is, key words rather, are repurchase agreement. So the idea here seems to be, which is, of course, a lending agreement that the government would lend gold to itself in return for cash with an agreement to reverse the transaction some time later. But the presence of that cash would relieve the United States of the need to issue more debt. So this is purely an internal accounting game, perhaps not totally unlike quantitative easing, but never mind. And why this would affect the gold price in the real world as the US, you know, kind of moved pieces around on its internal chessboard, I have no idea. But, you know, monetising US side of the balance sheet, the whole thing strikes me as odd and jejune. But what do I know?

Katie Martin
Yeah. I mean, what I do know is that, like, you know, I’ve seen lots of commentary kicking around for the past couple of years saying the gold price is getting out of hand. It’s got to stabilise soon. It’s got to fall soon. And it just never does. It’s been on the up and up.

Robert Armstrong
Yes. The $2,100 level, we’re now at 29. The idea was, you know, people who buy it for investment are gold- or price-sensitive and stop buying at around like, $2,100 historically. Nope. Didn’t happen.

Katie Martin
Nope. Not so much. Yeah. And my expectation would be as long as, like, geopolitics stays unstable and as long as Trump remains mercurial, as we’ve decided we’re gonna call him, then my hunch would be that this official buying is gonna carry on. It’s not gonna get slammed into reverse. So, I mean, great times for gold bugs.

Robert Armstrong
Indeed. Yes. And look, you and I can argue about whether gold is a proper asset or is really a currency or this or that until our faces turn blue. But if the world’s central banks are buying this stuff, our academic objections really don’t matter today. Do they?

Katie Martin
Yeah. It’s almost as if we don’t matter at all. (Laughter) Nobody is listening to us. Hey ho, story of my life.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Let’s wrap it up there, Rob. We all gonna be back in a sec with Long/Short.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Alrighty. Now it’s time for Long/Short, that part of the show where we go long a thing we love or short a thing we hate. Rob, what you got?

Robert Armstrong
I have a pair trade for you, Katie. I’m gonna go short the penny and long candy. And here is why. Hard candies, specifically. So President Trump, as listeners may have heard, wants to get rid of the penny because it costs more to make a penny than a penny is worth. That doesn’t seem to make sense. And as everyone knows, pennies are super annoying. We all have the physical manifestation of how annoying they are in the huge jars full of pennies we all hold in our houses. So I think get rid of the penny. Be gone, penny. You are an annoying relic of an earlier time. But it also makes me think of the fact that back in my youth, when I travelled to Italy, when they still had the lira.

Katie Martin
In the old days.

Robert Armstrong
And there was like this thing where you couldn’t make the liras were so values that you couldn’t make precise change or whatever any more. So they would just like give you roughly your change and like, a piece of candy to make up the difference. And like, we have a transaction in the United States that, you know, doesn’t round to the nearest nickel or whatever. I think we’ll just cover the difference with hard candies, which is why we should be long the hard candy industry.

Katie Martin
Why don’t you just pay with your phones like everybody else?

Robert Armstrong
Communist. That would be communist.

Katie Martin
I am long tech bro drama. So Elon Musk says he wants to buy OpenAI for $100bn with his mates. I don’t know. Sam Altman, who runs OpenAI, immediately snapped back with a no thanks, but we’ll buy X off you for $10bn. (Robert laughs) And then he said on the television, this is Sam Altman. You know, I feel for the guy. I don’t think he’s like, a happy person. No. I don’t really care who gets to be the biggest, baddest tech bro. Although I do have some concerns around competition, proximity to power, that sort of thing. But I am very much here for the drama, the cat fighting, the bro on bro, like...

Robert Armstrong
Tech Bros the Musical is gonna be so awesome.

Katie Martin
Whatever happened to wasn’t Musk gonna fight Mark Zuckerberg in a cage fight, and that disappointingly never happened. So if we can resurrect the tech bro cage fighting, then I will pay all of my money to watch on TV.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Robert Armstrong
Katie, we live in a true golden age.

Katie Martin
(Laughter) What a time to be alive. If we are still alive on Thursday, we will be back in your ears then. So listen up.

[MUSIC PLAYING]",FEB 11 2025,Transcript,Transcript: Why is gold buggin’?,Katie Martin speaks to Robert Armstrong,Katie Martin and Robert Armstrong,Print this page,(opens in new window)," [MUSIC PLAYING] Katie Martin The hottest asset on the planet right now is not some fancy tech stock or even a super soaraway memecoin. It’s gold. People are desperate to get their hands on the stuff. It’s up like 10 per cent this year, even though some of the things we normally look at elsewhere in markets that tell us what gold is gonna do are not really pointing that way. So today on the show we’re asking what is going on with this thing?  This is Unhedged, the markets and finance podcast from the Financial Times and Pushkin. I’m Katie Martin, a markets columnist at the FT in London. And typically, I’ve got to say, I’m not much of a gold bug, but I bow down to the performance of this most ancient of assets. And speaking of ancient, guess who’s back? Robert Armstrong
(Laughter) I didn’t see that coming. Katie Martin
(Laughter) It’s Rob Armstrong of the Unhedged newsletter. Robert Armstrong
The only asset more ancient than gold — Rob Armstrong, financial commentator. Oh, dear. Katie Martin
Yes. I figured that joke might need work, but turns out it worked pretty well. But how are you doing? You’ve been away. You’ve been outside of New York City. Were there dragons? Robert Armstrong
I recently went to Arizona, beautiful Arizona, for an investment conference and talked to a lot of people who manage endowment and foundation money. Katie Martin
Big money. Robert Armstrong
And let me tell you, they are as puzzled as the rest of us about what is going on in the world right now. You know, it’s funny. People who run like, a university’s money, they have an office of three people or whatever and they’re running like $1bn or $2bn. And they outsource all this stuff. So they find outside managers to do it. But still, they have to decide which manager and what to allocate to which assets. And these people are all overwhelmed anyway. And this period of time is very overwhelming for them because they feel they should do something in response to all the weird changes going on in the world. But they don’t know what it is. So I say welcome to the party, endowment manager. Katie Martin
You know, you ask the experts like, what’s going on and they say, like, you tell me. Robert Armstrong
(Laughter) I have no idea. Katie Martin
The scary thought is maybe they’re figuring it out from this podcast. Robert Armstrong
But this brings us precisely to the question of gold, which is the asset which you buy when you feel uncertain about things, right? Katie Martin
Yes. When bad stuff happens, gold goes up. When people are worried about the state of the world, gold goes up. Gold is up right now. Robert Armstrong
I think we should be a bit more specific about that. It’s only when things . . . Historically, the only time gold really outperforms your normal financial assets like stocks or bonds or whatever is when things are really bad. Like in proper crises is when gold really is a useful diversifier and hedge. When things are only mildly bad it’s actually a terrible asset to own. Katie Martin
But look, let’s just talk about what it’s done so far this year. As I mentioned, it’s up 10 per cent year to date. And like, last time I checked, it’s still only February. That’s quite a lot. Robert Armstrong
Yeah, it’s a big move on top of earlier big moves. Katie Martin
Yeah. So it’s up 40 per cent since the start of 2024. We are now at something like $2,900 an ounce. Ye gods. That’s a big number. Robert Armstrong
It’s basically doubled since late 2022. It’s a really impressive run. Katie Martin
Very impressive. So when you’re talking about gold, yes, very obviously it is a metal. Robert Armstrong
Yeah. It’s not a vegetable. Katie Martin
I’m no scientist, but I know this much. But it doesn’t move around based on the sorts of things that other metals move around because its industrial uses are not the main driver of the price. So it’s more of a kind a... Robert Armstrong
Yes, there are industrial uses for this stuff, but most of the demand comes from jewellery/investment demand. And in some parts of the world those two are the same thing. But you know what was weird about the run in gold that went from, say, early 2024 to kind of the fall of last year, is that the usual things that kind of moved the gold price, which are the real interest rate — that is the interest rate after inflation — and the dollar — because gold is priced in dollars, when the dollar strengthens, the gold price usually goes down. Those things which usually allow you to navigate the gold price — you know, understand the gold price a little bit. Those things are actually going the other direction. In other words, real yields were going up, increasing the opportunity price of owning gold, which should in theory make gold go down. And yet gold went up. And the dollar was getting stronger, which should create pressure on gold. And yet gold was going up. Now, however, in this latest 2025 rally, at least those things are all going the direction they’re supposed to go. Real yields have come down. The dollar has, quite surprisingly in recent weeks, weakened when everybody thought it was gonna strengthen. And gold has responded the way gold is supposed to respond. So yay for this tiny shred of economic logic in what is happening lately to gold. Katie Martin
There is a little bit of logic, but there has been a break in the logic as well. So going back to your point about real yields. So the whole point of gold is if you hold it as an asset, it is a pet rock, right? This thing does not pay you dividends like a lot of stocks do. It doesn’t pay you any sort of return like a bond does. It’s just a nice shiny rock and it goes up in price or it goes down in price. And so normally when yields are high, when bond yields are high, particularly in relation to inflation, people say, I don’t need gold in my portfolio, it doesn’t pay me anything. I may as well own these bonds instead. But that is not what’s been going on recently so it is a bit of a head-scratcher. Robert Armstrong
Yeah. Yields are higher and real yields still are high. But we should make the distinction between the level and the rate of change. And the level is still high, but, you know, the rate of change is at least in the last few weeks, going gold’s direction. We should also talk about, you know, why else gold might be in demand right now, right? And this brings us to every gold bug’s favourite story, which is kind of the de-dollarisation story. If the global reserve currency, which is the dollar, is something you don’t wanna hold any more, then the natural substitute — because goodness knows you don’t wanna hold Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollars, God help you the euro — is to go to what is sometimes thought of as a currency in gold. So is de-dollarisation part of the story here, a move away from the dollar part of the story here? Katie Martin
I’m not sure it’s quite de-dollarisation, but there is definitely something going on whereby official reserve holders, right, which is like this sort of catch-all term that encompasses like big sovereign wealth funds and central banks around the world and other kind of government-related stores of national wealth around the world. One thing you can definitely see is that they have, particularly actually since the election of Donald Trump, they have pulled back from US government bonds. And instead, so they’re not saying, right, we’re gonna put our reserves in Chinese renminbi, because that’s got certain issues around it, around whether you can get the money out again. They’re not necessarily saying we’re gonna put our money into euros and government bonds because, again, the euro is a bit of a, you know, a problematic currency for those big long-term managers of money because it’s just . . . It’s got some structural flaws. You know, the euro is a big slice of these reserves. But still, we digress. But what they are doing is saying, I don’t necessarily need any sort of bonds in my portfolio here. I’m gonna put the money into gold. And so we’re seeing quite a lot of gold purchases from central banks around the world. And that is kind of interesting, right? Robert Armstrong
Right. I mean, there’s two related reasons a central bank might buy gold. One is that you think holding treasuries, US Treasuries, which is the kind of natural way to hold the dollar, is no longer a good idea. Maybe you think the US is gonna become a fiscal basket case or whatever. The other reason is because dollars and dollar assets come with strings attached. If you accumulate as reserves dollars or dollar-based assets, you are vulnerable to US sanctions and you are subject to US political control. So you might say let me have a little gold in reserve so if I end up on the United States’s naughty list, I will still have an asset I can use to buy the things that I need. Katie Martin
Now, the last big example of that happening, which is why stuff like real yields and the price of gold have diverged over the past few years. The last time that really happened in dramatic fashion was 2022. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the US, like, pulled the cord, right? It said, OK, we’re going to use the power invested in us through the dollar being the global reserve currency to freeze Russia out of the dollar system. It basically used its currency as a weapon. Now, so other countries around the world look at this and they think, I don’t want to be in the same boat. Now, one way to avoid being in the same boat is not to launch a war of aggression against neighbouring states. So . . . Robert Armstrong
(Laughter) That’s one strategy, if you’re a wimp. Katie Martin
It’s just not that difficult, to my mind, to avoid. But you do have a new president in the White House. He is a mercurial character, one might say. He’s a lot less predictable. Robert Armstrong
That’s fair. Like him or not like him, you’re gonna use the word mercurial. Mercurial? Am I saying that right? I’m not even sure. Katie Martin
Mercurial. Yes. Who knows what he might do with this power in the future? And so it does look like, if you look at the timing between central banks around the world reducing their treasury holdings, central banks around the world increasing their gold holdings, there does seem to be a bit of a correlation. So it’s not mad to theorise here that these two things are related and there is a bit of a demand for gold out there from governments around the world that don’t want to, as you say, get put on the US naughty step. Robert Armstrong
The World Gold Council provides us with their estimates of gold purchases, net new gold purchases by central banks. This is for 2024. And your number one gold buyer with over 80 tonnes of gold purchased: Poland. Filling out the top five, which with quite a bit less than Poland, are Turkey, India, Azerbaijan and China. And those are by far the biggest new gold purchasers. China added 40-odd billion, I mean, 40-odd tonnes of gold, yes. It’s important in shows like this to get the units right. You end up sending extremely silly. Katie Martin
Get your units right. Show you’re working. Robert Armstrong
If you look at those five countries, they are either close to, in the sphere of influence of or are uneasy allies with Russia. So Poland, of course, a close neighbour and a close neighbour of Ukraine; Turkey, long a kind of bridge between the European west and the Russian east; Azerbaijan, very much in that neighbourhood as well. And both China and India have been an outlet for Russian energy, oil and gas under US sanctions. So their purchases of gold, heavy purchases of gold this year are not coincidental. Katie Martin
Yeah. So the World Gold Council was saying that last year, so 2024, central banks added over a thousand tonnes of gold to their global reserves. And that’s the third year in a row it’s been over a thousand tonnes. And there’s been like a massive step change from pre-2022 to post-2022. So a thousand tonnes a year has become the new normal that you, like, really over the past sort of three years. But there’s definitely something going on around sanctions-proofing your reserves, which is just super interesting, although people buy it for different reasons, right? It’s security. It is a store of wealth. Robert Armstrong
It’s a very emotional asset. Katie Martin
It’s a very emotional asset. And it’s, you know, got a very long history behind it. So central banks buy it for, you know, whatever their motivations are. But the point is that they are buying in pretty substantial numbers. Robert Armstrong
And have been, I should note, and have been for a couple of years now. It’s been not just the last couple of weeks or months that central banks have started to marginally move towards gold. Katie Martin
But one thing that has really accelerated quite quickly is I’m sure you saw the story that we ran the other day from Leslie Hook, who writes about metals and commodities for us. Robert Armstrong
Yes. Katie Martin
And she was writing that there’s been a massive surge in shipments of gold to the US, creating a shortage of bullion in London. So there’s a huge stockpile of this stuff in New York. There’s a real kind of, you know, sucking noise as oil does sort of... Robert Armstrong
 As it goes from one place to the other. Katie Martin
Exactly. And one of the analysts that she quoted in the story was saying there’s a feeling that Trump could go across the board and impose new tariffs on raw materials coming into the US, including gold. And so people are trying to get ahead of that. And so all of a sudden, if you want to get your gold from the UK over to New York, then there’s quite a long waiting list actually, to make that happen. Quite an unusually long one. Robert Armstrong
It really brings out how different this asset is. Gold is very heavy and when there is a financial, a global financial imbalance, such as an imbalance between the physical gold price in London and the gold futures price in New York, people actually take this heavy stuff and put it on an airplane and fly it over the ocean. Katie Martin
Must cost a fortune. Yeah. Robert Armstrong
To me, this is just astonishing that in our modern day and age we are closing what are essentially financial transactions by putting heavy metals on to planes and flying them across the ocean. And you know what is even weirder about this kind of New York-London arbitrage is that in order to deliver gold to either close a contract or just a transaction in the two markets, the gold has to be in different-shaped bars. So if you want to take London cash market gold and get it to New York, you first generally fly it to a refinery in Switzerland, melt it down into a different shape so it’s the shape that Comex exchanges will take in New York before you fly it. It just shows you this asset is not like the others. The other ones you’re just like, make a phone call. I’ll trade you this for that. Yes. OK. Hang up phone. Whole thing is over.

So normally, though, one of the things that’s bugging me about this is that when the gold price shoots higher, that’s because there’s some sort of war, pestilence, terrible thing, horsemen of the apocalypse. Something terrible is happening. So it is sort of strange that you’ve got this massive run-up in the price of gold while stocks are still doing pretty well and bonds are still doing relatively badly. Like, there is no sort of giant flight to safety going on that would normally be associated with a rise in the gold price that’s like this.

[MUSIC PLAYING]",2025-02-11,This is an audio transcript of the Unhedged podcast episode,"In a recent episode of the Unhedged podcast, hosts Katie Martin and Robert Armstrong discuss the rise in gold prices, which have increased by about 10% in early 2024 and nearly 40% since late 2022. Despite traditional market indicators like real interest rates not signaling this rise, both agree that gold typically performs well during crises and uncertainty.

Gold is mainly driven by demand for jewelry and investment, rather than industrial use. The hosts note a growing trend among central banks, especially since 2022, to purchase gold instead of US Treasury bonds to diversify and protect against potential political sanctions related to the dollar. Notably, countries such as Poland and Turkey have made significant gold purchases.

Additionally, there is speculation that the US might revalue its gold holdings, which could potentially impact its financial standing and the gold market overall. The hosts express confusion over the lack of a traditional flight to safety typically seen with rising gold prices alongside declining stock markets, and they highlight how unique and labor-intensive trading gold is compared to other assets.

The conversation concludes with reflections on gold's emotional and historical significance in the economy and its status as a hedge against geopolitical instability."

Katie Martin
So you know the script, right? This year in markets is all about American exceptionalism and nowhere else gets a look in. So you might be a little surprised to hear that UK stocks have been hitting record highs.

Same goes for Germany. In fact, you could argue that in his own little way, Donald Trump is making Europe great again. This is all a bit odd, given that Trump could still slap taxes on European exports to the US at any moment. So today on the show we’re asking, what’s this all about? Are the markets around the world on the up because of Trump or in spite of him?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

This is Unhedged, the markets and finance podcast from the Financial Times and Pushkin. I’m Katie Martin, a markets columnist here at FT towers in London. And once again, I’m joined by the New York-based Unhedged newsletter scribe Aiden Reiter, who’s here in London with me, and where I’m gonna call it, Aiden. There is a tiny note of spring in the air.

Aiden Reiter
It was beautiful out today. I actually sat outside for lunch without a jacket.

Katie Martin
Everything has got better since you got here.

Aiden Reiter
Well, I can’t take all the credit. You have to give some of that to Andrew Bailey.

Katie Martin
Governor of the Bank of England. We will come on to that in a bit. So look, over in the States you talk to lots of investors. Like, do people even care about Europe at all? Do they bring us up in conversation?

Aiden Reiter
I mean, unless we bring it up, it doesn’t come up naturally. That’s fair, right? S&P 500 has been the source of all the growth in the world and all the high valuations for the past couple of years.

Katie Martin
So it’s all USA, USA.

Aiden Reiter
USA, USA. And so much so that owning other forms of assets, whether they be foreign equities, foreign fixed incomes, emerging markets, just isn’t in vogue any more.

Katie Martin
Yeah. I was talking to a US wealth manager the other day and he was saying that a lot of his clients are now starting to question, why do I need to diversify at all? Why don’t I just put everything in the US? That feels a little bit unhealthy. It’s called putting all your eggs in one basket, listeners.

Aiden Reiter
But, you know, there’s so many egg notes that we get every day. And while there has been a lot more banks and a lot more asset managers saying, hey, maybe you should diversify, I haven’t seen a lot of diversification notes about diversifying out of the US. It’s just other asset classes, as opposed to just S&P 500.

Katie Martin
Right. That said, I’m sure you are also a regular reader of this. I read the fund manager survey that comes out of Bank of America every month. And they were saying in the last report, so about a week or so ago, they were saying that in the biggest switch among fund managers out of US and into Europe for 25 years. Like, there is money coming into Europe.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. And the stocks are showing it.

Katie Martin
Yep, stocks are showing it. So, Dax, the German index, that’s up over 9 per cent so far this year.

Aiden Reiter
Pretty good.

Katie Martin
It’s February, the something or other. That’s not bad. The FTSE 100 is also a record high. It’s up about 7 per cent. So the Stoxx 600 index, which is like all across Europe, that’s also up about 7 per cent. Now the FTSE 250, which is an index of more mid-cap UK stocks, ignore that one.

Aiden Reiter
(Laughter) Is it down?

Katie Martin
It’s not down, but it remains the place where fun goes to die. It’s up by like about 2 per cent. So that’s not doing so well. But it just strikes me as really odd that people are not making a noise about Europe.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. I mean, again, the story, whether that be the politics story, the geopolitics story or the market story, has just been Donald Trump and the United States for so long.

Katie Martin
Yeah. He’s cutting taxes. He’s very focused on domestic growth. He’s cutting regulation. That’s all got to be good for the bottom line of US companies.

Aiden Reiter
It’s sounded like you’re gonna say he’s very focused on DaMexico, and that’s true, too, right? He’s talking about tariffs on America’s neighbours, Canada and Mexico, which has huge implications for the S&P 500. So not only does money just overall only flow to the United States, all of our collective attention does, too.

Katie Martin
Yeah, it’s so true. OK, so because you bring up tariffs, let’s start with tariffs. Trump has spoken about wanting to impose tariffs on the EU and on Europe. And look, he might impose trade tariffs on the UK, but we’ve had the foresight to not really export anything any more.

Aiden Reiter
(Laughter) That was really, really wise. Of all the industrialists.

Katie Martin
We saw this coming. So we export much more services to the US and they’re much more difficult to put taxes on. So like UK, we wouldn’t like to see trade tariffs come in, but we should be able to kind of handle it. It will be a bigger issue for the EU.

But you look at where Trump has focused his efforts so far this year. There was Colombia, which got tariffs placed on it for about three hours. That came and went.

Then, as we were discussing the other day, there was the threat of tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Before they came in there was some sort of delay that was agreed on whether these things will actually happen or not, we don’t know. China, there’s already tariffs there. And he’s ratcheted them up. And that’s a whole other issue.

Aiden Reiter
And China retaliated in kind.

Katie Martin
And China retaliated. They’re not taking this lying down. But the point is, there just seems to be quite a lot of doubt in the market that he’s going to follow through and actually put these tariffs on the EU. So that does a couple of things. That means that this big, horrible risk to EU exporters just hasn’t actually crystallised yet. It hasn’t actually happened.

And it means, look, if we’re gonna have this thing where Donald Trump threatens things and then doesn’t follow through on them, at a certain point markets are gonna call his bluff. They’re kind of already calling his bluff. And that just means that risky assets can either play catch-up in the case of Europe because, you know, they lagged behind the US last year, or you can just take a punt on them as a riskier bet all of their own.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. So in your mind, does the high of the FTSE recently and the high of the Dax and the high of stocks reflect people not thinking Trump’s tariffs will come? Like to what extent do you think it’s playing into fund managers’ and investors’ calculus?

Katie Martin
I think it’s definitely there. And I think that the fact that the tariffs haven’t come yet despite all of these warnings that came ahead of time, that’s supportive to like, you know what people in markets called risk sentiment, right? It’s just sort of . . . it’s helpful to the mood. The other thing is, if you buy into the idea that tariffs on imports into the US are inflationary in the US, and that’s one of the big reasons why the dollar has been pushing higher.

Aiden Reiter
It’s been rippin’.

Katie Martin
It’s been rippin’. That means you have a weak euro and it means you have weak sterling and it means you have, you know, all the other major currencies around the world have been much weaker. And that’s great for exporters across the Eurozone.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah, right. Contrary to what Trump wants, it’s actually theoretically helping foreign exports.

Katie Martin
And also, you’ve got central banks in the Eurozone and the UK cutting rates, whereas in the US the Federal Reserve is slightly painted into a corner here. They can’t keep cutting as much as the market previously expected.

Aiden Reiter
And they paused in this most recent meeting. The tone they struck was not necessarily hawkish, but it seems like they are willing to pause and wait and see where inflation goes, which is a very clever way of not weighing in on what they think tariffs will do.

So to your point, right, part of the surge in these other economies might just be down to diverging paths for monetary policy.

Katie Martin
Yeah. So for example, just earlier today, we’re recording this on . . . what day is it? It’s Thursday. It’s so hard to remember what day it is because we get so much news crammed into individual weeks. So the Bank of England cut interest rates. It cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, which is what the market had been expecting. But two of the nine votes on the money policy committee were to cut by half a point. And one of those calling for half a point, Catherine Mann, she’d been voting to stay on hold while the rest of the Monetary Policy Committee was voting to cut until really quite recently.

Aiden Reiter
She’s famously very hawkish.

Katie Martin
So that’s weird, right?

Aiden Reiter
Yeah.

Katie Martin
And it tells you a couple of things. It tells you even if the UK economy is in a spot of bother, which I think is reasonable to say that we are.

Aiden Reiter
Yes. I mean, today the Bank of England downgraded their forecast for UK growth this year I think by half. So it’s interesting that FTSE is soaring when the economic outlook is so, so bad.

Katie Martin
It is and it isn’t because the weird thing that the UK market does is stocks move in the opposite direction to the currency because such a large part of revenues in the FTSE 100 are dollar-denominated.

Aiden Reiter
Oh, I see.

Katie Martin
That’s why, you know, stocks often go up in the UK even when the economy is performing badly because sterling is weaker. So it’s just another reminder that economic performance and market performance are not necessarily the same thing.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. So is the reason the FTSE is hitting record highs the one-two punch of a rate cut and worse growth?

Katie Martin
In a way, yes. And that’s also why you’ve got this gap between the FTSE 100, which is very international, full of dollar revenues, and the FTSE 250, which is much more domestic; a lot more mid-caps and smaller stocks there. That’s kind of a better reflection of the UK economy, you might argue. So that’s why you’ve got the FTSE 100 kind of pulling ahead of the FTSE 250. And I think one of the other reasons why European markets are doing better than I think a lot of people expected is so the US market is all about tech, tech, tech. And it turns out that’s not necessarily a good thing, you know, so . . . 

Aiden Reiter
Concentration is not always your friend.

Katie Martin
Concentration is definitely your friend when it works in your direction.

Aiden Reiter
And it has been for quite a while. But as we learned with DeepSeek, there’s a lot of risk there.

Katie Martin
Yeah. So China came out with its own decent quality, very cheap AI alternative. We talked about this on the pod a little while ago and you can listen back. So maybe having a stock market that’s not so tech-heavy is not such a bad thing after all.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah, absolutely. That brings us to China, though, which I think is also a complicated picture in this. To your point on it’s good to have a market that’s not too tech-heavy, Chinese stocks have had an interesting run for the past six months. When China did a fiscal stimulus, as we’ve spoken about on the pod — sorry, they did a stock stimulus, is more accurate —hey really tried to pump up the stock market, had a huge surge. They had a huge surge, both because of that support, but also because the Chinese government flirted with the idea of doing real fiscal stimulus.

That has not come to bear, the fiscal stimulus part. So since that huge jump in October, I believe, they’ve just been slowly sliding down. They’re still higher than they were before that was announced because it seems like the Chinese government will do some form of stimulus. And China exceeded most people’s growth expectations this year. It hit its 5 per cent target.

But what’s interesting here is Chinese stocks have had a pretty big fall in beginning of the year. Part of the reason is Tencent, which is a large part of their stock index, the CSI and HSI, it fell after the United States government put it on a blacklist. And so if you have too much concentration of your stock market around tech, around things that have high exposure to the US, that can be tricky for you.

Katie Martin
So that’s probably why. So lots of other markets around the world have been having a decent run actually so far this year whereas the CSI 300 in China’s down like 2 per cent or something.

Aiden Reiter
Two per cent this year.

Katie Martin
That’s not a disaster.

Aiden Reiter
Absolutely. And given the history of Chinese stocks, that’s not bad at all. What happened over the past two weeks was most Chinese investors and markets were closed because of Chinese New Year. So yesterday — or this is Thursday — on Wednesday was the first day they were open after Chinese New Year. And in the time they were closed, you had the announcement of Trump tariffs, of China’s retaliation and you had DeepSeek.

But when it opened, it went up a little bit on bullish sentiment and then it just kind of flatlined, slowed the rest of the day. And I think it’s a reflection of a couple of things, right? People are not as bullish once they realised that US tariffs on China will have an impact. And also because there hasn’t been that much materially changed in the stock market situation, even with DeepSeek, that would change the narrative of Chinese stocks.

Katie Martin
What are you picking up in terms of what investors tell you about whether China is investable? You get a lot of back and forth on this. Like for some investors, particularly ones that are quite risk-averse, they’re just like, I don’t get it. I’m out. The regulatory risk is too high. The policy risk is too high. The Trump risk is too high. I just don’t . . . I don’t see the point of putting money on the line in China. And others are like, it’s one of the biggest economies in the world, guys. Like, it’s a big part of the emerging markets complex and you got to have something there. I don’t know. What are you picking up on?

Aiden Reiter
To your point, a lot investors say we don’t want to touch it. There are, however, a lot of China bulls who say I actually only want exposure to China because I think there’s so much upside and their stock market is so undervalued based on what the economy is. I have spoken with more investors who are more interested in the more complex trades in China as opposed to just going along their index or their stocks using, you know, renminbi pegs and using FX trading in order to get a profit. That is a much more usable system, more predictable system.

Katie Martin
What about emerging markets?

Aiden Reiter
I mean, emerging markets had an interesting year. So they have been down since October despite, you know, Europe and everybody else ripping. And that’s for a couple of reasons. Part of it is the outlook for them is not so great under Trump. The strong dollar, not good for the rest of the world generally.

They also have diverging monetary policy from Europe and the UK. A lot of these economies have actually hiked rates, not lowered rates because inflation’s picking up. That tends to be bad for stock markets.

But there’s also some interesting things happening in these indices over time. Something that we’re going to be writing about on Unhedged newsletter soon is that these indices have also become more concentrated. So if you look at emerging markets ex China, that typical index that excludes China, TSMC is now 15 per cent of that. TSMC is Taiwan Semiconductor. And Taiwan Semiconductor relies on a lot of the narratives that are going on in the US. So it’s not like it’s a good hedge any more, which is something that was appealing about emerging markets in the past 10 years.

Katie Martin
They were a big diversifier. Maybe they’re not such a diversifier after all.

Aiden Reiter
No, they’re getting very tech-heavy, especially in semiconductor chips and, you know, apps that are relying on the same narratives. On top of that, you know, being an emerging markets investor was always hard. You have to deal with a lot of disparate economies and disparate monetary policy pathways. And with that high concentration, it’s much harder now to invest in them. There’s just so much noise, essentially, across this really large basket as we’ve talked about, a basket that probably shouldn’t be together.

Katie Martin
Yeah. Emerging market is a stupid phrase, but it is what it is. We’ve just got to live with it.

Aiden Reiter
There’s no way Korea and Ghana should be in the same basket.

Katie Martin
No, it’s silly. We’re using the vocabulary we have. But I guess, like, the moral of the story is, there’s way too much focus on the US.

Aiden Reiter
Absolutely.

Katie Martin
And also, like, is the rest of the world cheap? Like the price/earnings ratios are much, much lower, which means you as an investor are paying out less money for the revenues that the companies bring in.

Aiden Reiter
Yes, but, you know, you have to also look that the US is a big market and these are some of the world’s best companies. When you actually look at these indices and you look at companies that are comparable, whether that be Ahold Delhaize — I think I’m saying that right — versus Kroger in the US or BAE in the UK versus Lockheed. When you just go down, there’s not that much of a discount.

Katie Martin
That’s the thing. If you compare it on an index level, S&P 500 price/earnings ratios to FTSE 100 price/earnings ratios, it looks like the UK is just absurdly cheap and you must, must buy it. But again, because there’s so much tech concentration in the US, that skews all of these comparisons out of line, whereas if you compare something that’s much more apples to apples, oranges to oranges — so take a construction company against a construction company — the disparity is actually not that high.

Aiden Reiter
No. There’s not that many discounts on a one-to-one basis. Same with the index. If you do the price/earnings over growth of the indices and you compare them to the US, there’s not even that much of a discount to begin with. So wouldn’t you rather just own the whole US growth story as opposed to a sliver of it?

Katie Martin
Yeah. It’s reasonable. But. It does strike me that there’s a lot of people out there, whether they are retail investors or wealth management clients, who’ve really got their blinkers on. They can only see the US and, you know, the kind of cliché markets is the closest you’re ever gonna get to a free lunch is to diversify and like, spread your bets a bit. So this is just all a bit of a reminder that that does make an awful lot of sense. This is not investment advice. But it does make a lot of sense.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

We are gonna be back in a sec with Long/Short.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Alrighty. Now it’s time for Long/Short, that part of the show where we go long a thing we love or short a thing we hate. Aiden, what you got?

Aiden Reiter
I am short posthumous publishing. And I’m not against authors’ works being published after their death. I just think there’s too many times they do it without the author’s express permission. So there was a story in the New York Times yesterday about Joan Didion’s notes to her husband being published, and they were not explicitly told to be published. They were just found very organised among her belongings. I personally believe we should be only publishing when the person has expressly said they want something published. Their publisher or agent surely would have known if they were working on a book.

Katie Martin
On the other hand, they are dead.

Aiden Reiter
They are dead. But again, got to respect those wishes. As much as I want to read that Joan Didion book, because I really do.

Katie Martin
OK. That’s an interesting short. I am short — I don’t know if you read this piece that we had. It was a Big Read the other day by our colleague Jennifer Hughes. I’m massively limit short the idea of 24-hour trading.

Aiden Reiter
Ooh, yeah.

Katie Martin
This is a no good, terrible, very bad idea to keep stock markets tradable 24 hours a day, seven or five days a week. I’m rolling my eyes so hard. Weekends and evenings are a really useful fire break when the brown stuff hits the fan. You do not want these things running 24 hours. I just think, please don’t do it. Which means it will almost certainly happen.

Aiden Reiter
Well, when I speak with crypto bros, they’re always like, well, the best benefit of crypto is all-the-time trading. I don’t want that.

Katie Martin
Until you get like margin called on Christmas Day.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah, absolutely. It’s just not like, I don’t think it’s a problem that we need to solve.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Katie Martin
No, but sometimes crazy things do happen, even if they’re very bad ideas. However, listeners, it’d be a very good idea to listen to us again when we are back in your ears on Tuesday. So chat to you then.

Yes. I mean, today the Bank of England downgraded their forecast for UK growth this year I think by half. So it’s interesting that FTSE is soaring when the economic outlook is so, so bad. Katie Martin
It is and it isn’t because the weird thing that the UK market does is stocks move in the opposite direction to the currency because such a large part of revenues in the FTSE 100 are dollar-denominated. Katie Martin
That’s why, you know, stocks often go up in the UK even when the economy is performing badly because sterling is weaker. So it’s just another reminder that economic performance and market performance are not necessarily the same thing. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. So is the reason the FTSE is hitting record highs the one-two punch of a rate cut and worse growth? Aiden Reiter
Yeah. Aiden Reiter
Concentration is not always your friend. Katie Martin
And it tells you a couple of things. It tells you even if the UK economy is in a spot of bother, which I think is reasonable to say that we are. Aiden Reiter
Oh, I see. Katie Martin
In a way, yes. And that’s also why you’ve got this gap between the FTSE 100, which is very international, full of dollar revenues, and the FTSE 250, which is much more domestic; a lot more mid-caps and smaller stocks there. That’s kind of a better reflection of the UK economy, you might argue. So that’s why you’ve got the FTSE 100 kind of pulling ahead of the FTSE 250. And I think one of the other reasons why European markets are doing better than I think a lot of people expected is so the US market is all about tech, tech, tech. And it turns out that’s not necessarily a good thing, you know, so . . .  Katie Martin
Concentration is definitely your friend when it works in your direction. Aiden Reiter
And it has been for quite a while. But as we learned with DeepSeek, there’s a lot of risk there. Katie Martin
Yeah. So China came out with its own decent quality, very cheap AI alternative. We talked about this on the pod a little while ago and you can listen back. So maybe having a stock market that’s not so tech-heavy is not such a bad thing after all. Aiden Reiter
Yeah, absolutely. That brings us to China, though, which I think is also a complicated picture in this. To your point on it’s good to have a market that’s not too tech-heavy, Chinese stocks have had an interesting run for the past six months. When China did a fiscal stimulus, as we’ve spoken about on the pod — sorry, they did a stock stimulus, is more accurate —hey really tried to pump up the stock market, had a huge surge. They had a huge surge, both because of that support, but also because the Chinese government flirted with the idea of doing real fiscal stimulus. That has not come to bear, the fiscal stimulus part. So since that huge jump in October, I believe, they’ve just been slowly sliding down. They’re still higher than they were before that was announced because it seems like the Chinese government will do some form of stimulus. And China exceeded most people’s growth expectations this year. It hit its 5 per cent target. But what’s interesting here is Chinese stocks have had a pretty big fall in beginning of the year. Part of the reason is Tencent, which is a large part of their stock index, the CSI and HSI, it fell after the United States government put it on a blacklist. And so if you have too much concentration of your stock market around tech, around things that have high exposure to the US, that can be tricky for you. Katie Martin
So that’s probably why. So lots of other markets around the world have been having a decent run actually so far this year whereas the CSI 300 in China’s down like 2 per cent or something. Aiden Reiter
Two per cent this year. Katie Martin
That’s not a disaster. Aiden Reiter
Absolutely. And given the history of Chinese stocks, that’s not bad at all. What happened over the past two weeks was most Chinese investors and markets were closed because of Chinese New Year. So yesterday — or this is Thursday — on Wednesday was the first day they were open after Chinese New Year. And in the time they were closed, you had the announcement of Trump tariffs, of China’s retaliation and you had DeepSeek. But when it opened, it went up a little bit on bullish sentiment and then it just kind of flatlined, slowed the rest of the day. And I think it’s a reflection of a couple of things, right? People are not as bullish once they realised that US tariffs on China will have an impact. And also because there hasn’t been that much materially changed in the stock market situation, even with DeepSeek, that would change the narrative of Chinese stocks. Katie Martin
What are you picking up in terms of what investors tell you about whether China is investable? You get a lot of back and forth on this. Like for some investors, particularly ones that are quite risk-averse, they’re just like, I don’t get it. I’m out. The regulatory risk is too high. The policy risk is too high. The Trump risk is too high. I just don’t . . . I don’t see the point of putting money on the line in China. And others are like, it’s one of the biggest economies in the world, guys. Like, it’s a big part of the emerging markets complex and you got to have something there. I don’t know. What are you picking up on? Aiden Reiter
To your point, a lot investors say we don’t want to touch it. There are, however, a lot of China bulls who say I actually only want exposure to China because I think there’s so much upside and their stock market is so undervalued based on what the economy is. I have spoken with more investors who are more interested in the more complex trades in China as opposed to just going along their index or their stocks using, you know, renminbi pegs and using FX trading in order to get a profit. That is a much more usable system, more predictable system. Katie Martin
What about emerging markets? Aiden Reiter
I mean, emerging markets had an interesting year. So they have been down since October despite, you know, Europe and everybody else ripping. And that’s for a couple of reasons. Part of it is the outlook for them is not so great under Trump. The strong dollar, not good for the rest of the world generally. They also have diverging monetary policy from Europe and the UK. A lot of these economies have actually hiked rates, not lowered rates because inflation’s picking up. That tends to be bad for stock markets. But there’s also some interesting things happening in these indices over time. Something that we’re going to be writing about on Unhedged newsletter soon is that these indices have also become more concentrated. So if you look at emerging markets ex China, that typical index that excludes China, TSMC is now 15 per cent of that. TSMC is Taiwan Semiconductor. And Taiwan Semiconductor relies on a lot of the narratives that are going on in the US. So it’s not like it’s a good hedge any more, which is something that was appealing about emerging markets in the past 10 years. Katie Martin
They were a big diversifier. Maybe they’re not such a diversifier after all. Aiden Reiter
No, they’re getting very tech-heavy, especially in semiconductor chips and, you know, apps that are relying on the same narratives. On top of that, you know, being an emerging markets investor was always hard. You have to deal with a lot of disparate economies and disparate monetary policy pathways. And with that high concentration, it’s much harder now to invest in them. There’s just so much noise, essentially, across this really large basket as we’ve talked about, a basket that probably shouldn’t be together. Katie Martin
Yeah. Emerging market is a stupid phrase, but it is what it is. We’ve just got to live with it. Aiden Reiter
There’s no way Korea and Ghana should be in the same basket. Katie Martin
No, it’s silly. We’re using the vocabulary we have. But I guess, like, the moral of the story is, there’s way too much focus on the US. Aiden Reiter
Absolutely. Katie Martin
And also, like, is the rest of the world cheap? Like the price/earnings ratios are much, much lower, which means you as an investor are paying out less money for the revenues that the companies bring in. Aiden Reiter
Yes, but, you know, you have to also look that the US is a big market and these are some of the world’s best companies. When you actually look at these indices and you look at companies that are comparable, whether that be Ahold Delhaize — I think I’m saying that right — versus Kroger in the US or BAE in the UK versus Lockheed. When you just go down, there’s not that much of a discount. Katie Martin
That’s the thing. If you compare it on an index level, S&P 500 price/earnings ratios to FTSE 100 price/earnings ratios, it looks like the UK is just absurdly cheap and you must, must buy it. But again, because there’s so much tech concentration in the US, that skews all of these comparisons out of line, whereas if you compare something that’s much more apples to apples, oranges to oranges — so take a construction company against a construction company — the disparity is actually not that high. Aiden Reiter
No. There’s not that many discounts on a one-to-one basis. Same with the index. If you do the price/earnings over growth of the indices and you compare them to the US, there’s not even that much of a discount to begin with. So wouldn’t you rather just own the whole US growth story as opposed to a sliver of it? Katie Martin Yeah. It’s reasonable. But. It does strike me that there’s a lot of people out there, whether they are retail investors or wealth management clients, who’ve really got their blinkers on. They can only see the US and, you know, the kind of cliché markets is the closest you’re ever gonna get to a free lunch is to diversify and like, spread your bets a bit. So this is just all a bit of a reminder that that does make an awful lot of sense. This is not investment advice. But it does make a lot of sense.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  We are gonna be back in a sec with Long/Short.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  Alrighty. Now it’s time for Long/Short, that part of the show where we go long a thing we love or short a thing we hate. Aiden, what you got? Aiden Reiter
I am short posthumous publishing. And I’m not against authors’ works being published after their death. I just think there’s too many times they do it without the author’s express permission. So there was a story in the New York Times yesterday about Joan Didion’s notes to her husband being published, and they were not explicitly told to be published. They were just found very organised among her belongings. I personally believe we should be only publishing when the person has expressly said they want something published. Their publisher or agent surely would have known if they were working on a book. Katie Martin
On the other hand, they are dead. Aiden Reiter
They are dead. But again, got to respect those wishes. As much as I want to read that Joan Didion book, because I really do. Katie Martin
OK. That’s an interesting short. I am short — I don’t know if you read this piece that we had. It was a Big Read the other day by our colleague Jennifer Hughes. I’m massively limit short the idea of 24-hour trading. Aiden Reiter
Ooh, yeah. Katie Martin
This is a no good, terrible, very bad idea to keep stock markets tradable 24 hours a day, seven or five days a week. I’m rolling my eyes so hard. Weekends and evenings are a really useful fire break when the brown stuff hits the fan. You do not want these things running 24 hours. I just think, please don’t do it. Which means it will almost certainly happen. Aiden Reiter
Well, when I speak with crypto bros, they’re always like, well, the best benefit of crypto is all-the-time trading. I don’t want that. Katie Martin
Until you get like margin called on Christmas Day. Aiden Reiter Yeah, absolutely. It’s just not like, I don’t think it’s a problem that we need to solve.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Katie Martin
No, but sometimes crazy things do happen, even if they’re very bad ideas. However, listeners, it’d be a very good idea to listen to us again when we are back in your ears on Tuesday.

[MUSIC PLAYING]",2025-02-06,This is an audio transcript of the Unhedged podcast episode,"In the recent *Unhedged* podcast episode, hosts Katie Martin and Aiden Reiter discuss how UK and German stocks are reaching record highs despite ongoing discussions about potential tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump on European exports. Traditionally, the U.S. stock market has dominated investor attention due to its strong growth, especially within the S&P 500 index, leading many investors to question the need for diversification beyond American assets.

However, the hosts highlight a significant trend: there's been a shift among fund managers who are starting to invest more in Europe, marking the largest shift in 25 years. European stocks, such as Germany’s Dax and the FTSE 100, have seen gains of over 9% and 7% respectively this year, indicating a growing confidence that Trump may not follow through on his threat of tariffs against Europe.

The conversation also touches on monetary policies, revealing that the Bank of England cut interest rates, which supports stock prices due to a weaker pound benefiting exporters. In contrast, the tech-heavy U.S. market creates risks, especially with emerging markets becoming more concentrated in tech sectors, making broad investment less attractive. 

Ultimately, the episode emphasizes the importance of not focusing exclusively on the U.S. market and suggests that investors might find better opportunities through diversification into undervalued global assets. The hosts acknowledge that while the U.S. remains a strong market, investors should not overlook potential in Europe and other regions."

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Katie Martin
The era of Trump 2.0 and his beloved trade tariffs is upon us. And hoo boy, it’s quite the ride. So far it has tangled up Colombia, Canada, Mexico, China. Maybe the EU and the UK next? We’ll see.

Today on the show, join us for a game of what the hell is actually going on here and why do we care? This is Unhedged, the markets and finance podcast from the Financial Times and Pushkin.

I’m Katie Martin, a slightly frazzled markets columnist here at FT towers in London and, exciting times, I’m joined today in person by the alarmingly young and clever Aiden Reiter from the Unhedged newsletter in New York. He’s in London, having briefly escaped the clutches of Rob Armstrong’s reign of terror. Aiden, how are you doing?

Aiden Reiter
I’m great. It’s great to be in London and away from towering, imperious Rob.

Katie Martin
Yeah. I’m much smaller than him and a lot less scary. So Aiden, one thing you know we like to do with this pod is like, answer questions that people really wanna know the answers to but are too afraid to ask for fear of looking silly. There is no such thing as a silly question on this podcast.

Aiden Reiter
Absolutely.

Katie Martin
Heaven knows I’ve asked enough of them myself. So just briefly, what are trade tariffs? Why does Donald Trump like them so much?

Aiden Reiter
Well, unclear why he loves them so much. He’s really obsessed with them and has been since the ’80s. But a tariff is essentially a tax. Essentially, you’re saying when a good or something comes into the United States or another country, there is going to be an extra duty on top of that good, whether that’s 10 per cent or 20 per cent of the price. And it just fundamentally changes the price for whoever is importing or exporting it, right? It could make it more expensive than a domestic product. It could make it more in line with the domestic product. So the basic idea is you change the economics and the calculus for domestic firms about what they want to import versus export.

Katie Martin
Yeah. So if you want to import this stuff from China, it’s gonna cost you. There’s already tariffs on China and there’s gonna be an extra 10 per cent on . . . 

Aiden Reiter
Across the board, which is unprecedented, at least in the past 20 years, US and China.

Katie Martin
And that means if you’re a US consumer, effectively you pay somewhat more. So this is something that confuses people, right? Who pays the tariffs?

Aiden Reiter
And it’s case by case. Sometimes if there’s enough margin and, you know, whoever is the US firm or foreign firm wants to keep their competitive advantage or their market share, they might choose to take on the cost of the tariff and not let it be reflected in the price. Most of the time, especially for low-margin companies, low-margin businesses, a lot of cheap goods, which is often what we get from China, that will be passed on to the consumer. Whether or not that’s, quote unquote, inflation is a much bigger conversation we don’t necessarily need to get into. But at the end of the day, somebody has to pay that tariff.

Katie Martin
Yeah. So it’s not always necessarily the case that if you put a 25 per cent tariff on Mexican or Canadian goods, which was what Trump was saying earlier this week, that the consumer ends up paying 25 per cent more.

Aiden Reiter
Not always.

Katie Martin
It can get smoothed out. But the point is, broadly speaking, Canada and Mexico don’t pay this or China doesn’t pay this. The bill is footed in the US.

Aiden Reiter
It could be footed by a Chinese, Canadian or Mexican firm, but that’s generally unlikely.

Katie Martin
And so the idea for Trump, like you say, he’s been talking about tariffs since the ’80s. This is something he’s loved for, I think, longer than you’ve been alive.

Aiden Reiter
Far longer.

Katie Martin
(Laughter) Don’t rub it in. (Aiden laughs) And the idea is if you make it more expensive to import stuff, then US manufacturing will catch up and you’ll make these things yourself and you will make America great again by renewing your exporting industry and your domestic consumption industry.

Aiden Reiter
To a lot of people in the United States — and there’s definitely some good arguments for and against this view when free trade was, you know, promulgated and, you know, Nafta was put in and WTO was more standardised.

Katie Martin
Yeah, all these big trade bodies.

Aiden Reiter
All these big trade bodies and big, you know, trade agreements were put in place, that resulted in a lot of manufacturing going to places where it was cheaper to do that. The US is a more developed economy with higher living standards. It’s more expensive to pay people. It’s also we have higher cost of doing many things the US for good reasons and for bad reasons. So in Donald Trump’s worldview, in many people’s worldview, we need to reset the clock. We need to change the calculus so that manufacturing is not always flowing away from United States. It’s flowing back to the United States.

Katie Martin
Now, the tricky thing here, and I don’t wanna get too deep in the weeds, is those things called supply chains, right? Say you want all car manufacturing for Americans to be done in America. There’s a lot of like, nuts and bolts and widgets and bits of car seats and this and that. They’re gonna come from Canada, they’re gonna come from Mexico. So there is very little manufacturing of stuff like that that you can do entirely at home. You’re very reliant on these like, complex webs of relationships between different countries. So slapping taxes on this stuff sounds complicated.

Aiden Reiter
Complicated, it’s disruptive. You know, we’ve already created these systems, right? One might endeavour to reform them as opposed to completely end them and sever them. These supply chains already exist. A lot of money has gone into making them. So there are some, you know, the Democratic party and other camps who think this gets rid of the, quote unquote, comparative advantage that certain economies have and whether they can make certain goods more efficiently. It’s a big, meaty topic.

But at the end of the day, it’s disruptive to put these tariffs in place. Donald Trump, from the first time he, you know, rolled off that golden escalator in 2015, he’s been, you know, lamenting trade deficits. So it’s not necessarily that the US imports from other places. It’s that it is so uneven that, you know, China exports a tonne of goods to us and we only export some goods to them. 

Aiden Reiter
What’s interesting about Trump’s approach so far is that China, not Canada or Mexico, is the place where we have the larger trade deficit. Imports from Canada and Mexico are higher than they are from China. It’s because our supply chains as neighbours are so intensely integrated. But China, there is actually much more of an imbalance. So it’s very surprising to many pundits, especially because China and tariffs on China were a big part of his campaign promises, that the first focus was not China. It was 10 per cent on China. It was 25 per cent on Canada and Mexico, who are allies, who’ve gone to war with us. It was all very confusing.

Katie Martin
Yeah. So the choice of targets for tariffs is quite weird. So, yeah, let’s just go back to the long ago, distant days of the weekend. (Laughter) It’s Tuesday as we’re recording this, listeners. What did he say he was gonna do? So it was 25 per cent on Canada, 25 per cent on Mexico. This is like a total stink bomb, right, because no one saw this coming because, again, friends and allies.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. I mean, you know, it’s shocking the market didn’t see it coming because on his first day in office at the end of the day, he did say, I’m thinking by February 1st, we’ll put 25 per cent tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Just nobody thought he would go through with it even though so much of his campaign rhetoric was about tariffs. And again, it’s come back to the point that Canada and Mexico were not seen as the first targets of this, you know, onslaught. Everybody thought he would call it off by Friday. It was known that, you know, Trudeau had called in and there were negotiations between . . . 

Katie Martin
First, the Canadian prime minister.

Aiden Reiter
The Canadian prime minister, apparently, I’ve heard reports that he was trying to talk to him. Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican president, had very publicly pushed against him; unclear what was going on behind the scenes. So it wasn’t clear if that was actually going to go through. And then over the weekend, he was like, no, it’s going through. We’re doing this.

Katie Martin
We’re really gonna do this thing. So that is interesting because . . . let’s look at what the markets did, right? There was, you know, certainly if you looked at social media over the weekend, it was saying, you know, jeez, markets aren’t gonna like this very much. They’re gonna really fall out of bed.

They kind of, you know, rolled over in bed, but they didn’t fall out of bed. So we saw . . . So Chinese markets were shut, which is kind of reasonably important to note here. But there was a bit of a sell-off in Asia stocks. There was a decent sell-off in Europe because in Europe investors think, ha, we could be next for this treatment.

There was a little bit of a wobble in US stocks and the dollar picked up a little bit. Donald Trump tends to like a weaker dollar, so he doesn’t like the dollar strengthening. So these are all . . . 

Aiden Reiter
Well, he’s of two minds.

Katie Martin
He’s of two . . . We cannot go into the many, many folds of his brain.

Aiden Reiter
(Laughter) Yes, flooding the zone.

Katie Martin
Let’s not flood the zone here. But my point is, like, US stocks fell. I think they opened about 1.4 per cent lower. That is lame. That is nowhere near enough. You know, everyone talks about, well, the big kind of controlling factor on Donald Trump is the stock vigilantes. And he’s not gonna want to do anything that upsets markets. I hope you like my little . . . 

Aiden Reiter
(Laughter) It’s quite an impression.

Katie Martin
My pundit voice there. But the stock vigilantes are asleep at the wheel, right? If you want to get him to like, really change direction, you need markets to fall like a lot more than that.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. I mean, it could have been reflecting two things. It could have been reflecting that the market really never thought this was going to go through even when over the weekend he said it would. They still never believed him. And turns out they were right.

Katie Martin
They were right. He backtracked.

Aiden Reiter
It also could have been the market potentially underpricing and underappreciating just how integral Canada and Mexico are to many of our supply chains and many of our goods. So just looking very high-level at the numbers, we get 23 per cent of our oil from Canada that we actually consume. That’s 55 per cent of all of our oil imports. And while the US has a lot of shale, it’s a different grade of oil that we get from Canada. And we have a tonne of pipelines that already pump that out. And that’s already a lot of money in the ground and refineries that have already been tooled for that extra-grade crude, right, that heavy stuff.

Katie Martin
Didn’t his initial 25 per cent suggestion exclude that stuff, though?

Aiden Reiter
Ten per cent, as opposed to 25 per cent. So the first time he announced it, it was 25 per cent on everything. It seems the Trump administration got wind that the oil industry would not be very happy with them. And that was just brought down to 10 per cent. But still, we get so much of our stuff from Canada and so much of our energy from Canada. And while that was 10 per cent, as we wrote in the newsletter yesterday, it’s still pretty high.

Katie Martin
That’s a lot.

Aiden Reiter
That’s a lot. And it could really fundamentally reshape US oil markets and US energy markets. For Mexico, we get 16 per cent of our imports from Mexico — that’s more imports than we get from Canada — and 35 per cent of our automobiles. And those are integrated supply chains across the US, Canada, China, and crucially, Mexico. And you’d think that, you know, Ford and GM and these big stocks would fall off. And they did have a pretty big drop in the morning, but they pared back later in the day.

Katie Martin
Yeah. That’s the thing, right? This restraining factor that comes from the markets does not appear to be there. Now, again, that could be because investors are saying, I don’t believe you. Or it could be that investors are really bad at reading what he’s gonna do next. It could be a combination of these things. But the stabilisers are not there, right? Markets are not there. This idea that, well, he’s appointed Scott Bessent as Treasury secretary. He’s an adult in the room. Don’t worry, he won’t let anything too wild happen. Meh. Looks like his influence is pretty limited at this stage.

Aiden Reiter
Unclear. I mean, we have no idea what’s going on behind the scenes there. What we can say, and Unhedged newsletter has written a couple of times about who’s behind the scenes of the Trump econ policy, Bessent is very for a gradual approach, right? We’re gonna give them well, good advance. We’re gonna roll this out sequentially. We’re not just gonna hit the entire world with tariffs, which was originally a campaign proposal. It’s unclear if he influenced him.

That being said, I mean, 25 per cent tariffs on Canada and Mexico, while big and alarming, with a week notice is probably more than we expected from Trump on day one based on his rhetoric. So even this could have been showing restraint and that could be Bessent’s influence. Who knows?

Katie Martin
Who knows? The counterfactual is always impossible to prove. But what we can prove is, he said over the weekend, I’m absolutely serious about this. This was supposed to kick in sort of at some point this week. And then a few phone calls happen and he’s like, actually, I’ve changed my mind. There’s gonna be a delay, at least, with Mexico and Canada. He’s sticking to China, though.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah. So it’s a one-month delay on Canada and Mexico while they renegotiate terms. And this is, aligns with what many feel to be the negotiation tactic of tariffs, right? Some people question whether tariffs were an aim in and of itself. A lot of people think in the case of China, they are, right? We need to fix this trade deficit. A lot of people think they’re just a point of negotiation. And I think that Canada, Mexico and also Colombia last week show that Trump is using them for negotiations.

Katie Martin
On stuff that has nothing to do with trade, this is one of the things I think that investors find it so difficult to get around because if they could just look at a series of like, trade balances on an Excel spreadsheet, they could say, OK, this country, this country, this country are the most at risk of tariffs from the US. But actually, he’s looking not necessarily at trade balances. He’s looking at what help are you giving us with the border, whether that’s the border with Canada or the border with Mexico. He’s looking at stuff like the flow of fentanyl in and out of the country.

Aiden Reiter
And it’s arguable if it has anything to do with the flow of fentanyl or making the border more secure, right? It could all be, you know, stunting and not actually putting troops there. Who knows? We haven’t seen yet.

Yeah. It’s very hard for the market to read when it’s unclear what his actual aims are at the end of the day. Again, to your point, if it were just about trade deficits, we would have known he would have gone for China. And we would have known that he’d go hard on China. But even with China, it’s unclear this is about negotiations.

Reading into previous Republican talking points and papers on this, it seems they didn’t find 2018 and 2019 tariff negotiations with China to be particularly fruitful. So it seems that in the case of China, it’s a means in and of itself. But China’s hit-back on the United States today wasn’t completely crushing. And it would seem that they’re just trying to react by not poking the bear but also setting the stage for some negotiation. I mean, that’s a bit of speculation.

But they, essentially China hit back with 15 per cent tariffs on US coal exports, 15 per cent on US LNG exports, and then I believe it was 10 per cent on US oil exports. Now, remember that from China we get a lot of goods. It’s last thing Canada, Mexico. But we have a larger trade deficit. And part of that is electronics, which are around 220bn. And that’s anything from like a TV to a washer dryer.

Katie Martin
You Americans can’t live without your TVs.

Aiden Reiter
Can the Brits? I mean, you have to pay for a licence here. (Laughter)

Katie Martin
Sure. (Laughter)

Aiden Reiter
I guess that means you can live without it. (Both laugh) But, you know, while these are more targeted and seem to be designed to not hurt the Chinese economy, they shouldn’t be completely overlooked in, this case, the US.

Katie Martin
Yes, to a large extent, the US can boss the rest of the world around. But there are limits here. You know, these are other like, sovereign nations with like, tools at their disposal. Now, speaking of which, like the thing that Donald Trump has said would make the whole discussion about Canadian tariffs go away is, well, Canada should join the US, which . . . 

Aiden Reiter
I don’t think he wants that.

Katie Martin
I mean, how many electoral college votes would it get?

Aiden Reiter
Canada has roughly the population of the US’s most populous state, California. That’ll be 28 electoral college votes. And they probably wouldn’t go for Trump. I don’t think the Republicans actually want this. Also, plus two senators. Anyway, I don’t . . . There’s no world in which Canada’s joining the US.

Katie Martin
This is not gonna happen, but it would be really good trolling if they did from that point of view.

Aiden Reiter
We don’t wanna reward that trolling.

Katie Martin
No. OK, let’s park that idea. But so, yeah, in addition to the extra levies that China has imposed on imports from the US, they’ve also taken some quite interesting tacks in terms of they’ve renewed antitrust investigations involving Nvidia and Google. Where these will go, I don’t know, but it’s sand in the gears. And as you say, it’s like a signal that OK, but we’re not gonna take this lying down. We don’t have like, no power here. And the other thing that the Chinese have always got in their back pocket is the currency.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah.

Katie Martin
They can weaken that thing.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah, I mean, it’s largely expected by China analysts that they will allow it to slip past its current band of about, you know, the bottom threshold is 8 yuan to the US dollar, Rmb8. If they do that right, it allows their exports to continue being competitive even with tariffs in place. The question is, that would probably invite much more retaliation from Donald Trump and potentially even some allies. On the China question, Donald Trump seems to have support, right? Other countries are frustrated with China’s overcapacity.

Katie Martin
Yes, it is worth mentioning, right? Trump brought in a bunch of tariffs. The Democrats didn’t reverse them.

Aiden Reiter
They added to them. They amended them to make them a little more targeted and then added to them.

Katie Martin
Yeah. So there is bipartisan support for, you know, because there is just a massive imbalance with China.

Aiden Reiter
And the EU is concerned about it as well, right?

Katie Martin
Yeah, that’s true.

Aiden Reiter
There’s so much overcapacity. So he has allies. That being said, Donald Trump, as we’ve learned this week, doesn’t seem to care about keeping his allies aligned with his economic goals.

Katie Martin
Yeah. You think you’re his buddy, and then . . . So that kind of leads me on to the next thing I was gonna ask you, actually. Like, you know, put yourself in the situation where Aiden Reiter has been appointed chief trade negotiator with the EU.

Aiden Reiter
Oh goodness.

Katie Martin
(Laughter) Most fun job in the world.

Aiden Reiter
Sounds fun doing.

Katie Martin
How does the EU or like the UK or anyone else respond to this when you kind of are not quite sure where you are?

Aiden Reiter
It’s interesting because we saw both sides of the coin with Mexico and Canada. Canada was originally trying not to rock the boat. Mexico, you know, Claudia Sheinbaum, was much more assertive with Donald Trump. They both got their delay.

Katie Martin
Yeah.

Aiden Reiter
So it’s hard to draw lessons there. China doubled down and, you know, put 10 per cent tariffs. But again, not designed to wreck the US economy, although there will be definitely a felt impact. So I don’t think there’s a clear answer. I think Donald Trump will go after what he wants. The question is, will the market start learning how to respond to this?

Katie Martin
Well, that’s what I was gonna ask. What do markets do with this? Because the cliché with Trump is do you take him literally or seriously? I don’t think we’re any closer to knowing whether . . . I am old enough to remember that if the president or the Treasury secretary said something, you could take that statement to the bank and this is what is going to happen. Now we’re in a situation where you just kind of don’t know. He’s imposed these things. Is he gonna unravel it later today or is he gonna unravel it later tomorrow? Or . . . 

Aiden Reiter
I mean, he said a month from now is the delay. It seems that he’s willing to negotiate. And I think if anything we’ve learned this week is that tariffs, at least in his mind on everyone but China, are not an end in and of itself. They are a means to an end. They are means to negotiating, getting concessions, showing strength.

So if there’s anything we know, it’s that EU could theoretically negotiate if they were willing to play ball. The question is, are they in a position to play ball? And also, would they tolerate playing ball after being a US ally for so long that has gone with the US into war and worked together on many things. Trump has already gotten some of what he’s asked for from the EU in the last 10 years, right? Defence spending is increasing. There are things they are doing that have appeased him or will appease him. So it’s not clear what else they can give him besides changing some of the fundamental trade balances.

So long story short, I think he’s willing to negotiate, but it’s unclear what the outcome of these negotiations will be.

Katie Martin
Yeah. The other thing that I think we can really take away from this week is, like we were saying, markets did not like, completely lose it around this. And that, I think, is like a green light to Trump to say, see, told you, markets don’t care. I can do this again without hurting the US stock market too much.

So I think what he has quite possibly learnt this week is that this is fine. We can do this over and over. We can keep sending out these announcements. We can keep upsetting geopolitical relationships and there’s no blowback to the US.

Aiden Reiter
Yeah, I mean, we’ll see what these negotiations with Canada and Mexico yield, because if they don’t fundamentally change the trading relationship or they fail and increase prices, he’ll have consumer backlash. So he is really . . . To push forward any policy you’re risking somebody getting mad at you. The question is, will it be the market, the consumers or your allies first?

Katie Martin
Yeah. Someone’s gonna get cross. I don’t know where we’re gonna end up, but I do know we’re not gonna go there in a straight line.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

In the meantime, we’re gonna be back in a sec with Long/Short.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Alrighty. Now, it’s time for Long/Short, that part of the show where we go long a thing we love or short a thing we hate. Aiden, what you got?

Aiden Reiter
I’m short British tea culture. Not that I . . . Controversial, I know. Not that I don’t love high tea. I’m a huge tea drinker. Love tea, but I really like to find interesting leaves and blends from other countries.

Katie Martin
No, no, that’s not how you do it at all. You just drink like, tea. Like, just normal builder’s tea.

Aiden Reiter
Well, not even that. But even when you go to like, the nice tea stores in the UK, it’s not like, oh where, what interesting country or styles, this is, like, oh, would you like it with orange blossom or with lavender blossom or with lilac? It’s like, well, what tea is it? And they’re like, what do you mean what tea is it? So I’m short British tea culture.

Katie Martin
Oh God. Don’t understand anything.

Aiden Reiter
Dead in the comments. (Laughter)

Katie Martin
(Laughter) I am long The Penguin. Have you seen it? It’s HBO.

Aiden Reiter
Oh, the HBO show. I was like, an animal.

Katie Martin
Yeah. So I do like penguins in general, but The Penguin, the HBO show. So, like, desperate scenes in our household after The Traitors ended. Didn’t know what to watch. It was all very sad. But this thing is really good. Colin Farrell is amazing. The Sofia character is amazing. But Colin Farrell’s make-up and like, transformation is something else. Like, you wouldn’t know it was him.

Aiden Reiter
Here’s like . . . You wouldn’t know it’s him, but you can still tell there’s a gorgeous man under there. You can like, see it in his eyes. It’s like, ooh, that’s a good-looking man even though he’s wearing these, you know, all these prosthetics.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Katie Martin
I did not see that. But sure, I’ll take another look.

Aiden Reiter
Watch and just look at his eyes.

Katie Martin
It’s a big yes for me. Anyway, watch it. OK. We’re gonna be back in your ears on Thursday so listen up then.

[MUSIC PLAYING]",FEB 4 2025,Transcript,Transcript: What’s next for Trump’s tariffs?,Katie Martin speaks to Aiden Reiter,Katie Martin and Aiden Reiter,Print this page,(opens in new window),"[MUSIC PLAYING] Katie Martin The era of Trump 2.0 and his beloved trade tariffs is upon us. And hoo boy, it’s quite the ride. So far it has tangled up Colombia, Canada, Mexico, China. Maybe the EU and the UK next? We’ll see.  Today on the show, join us for a game of what the hell is actually going on here and why do we care? This is Unhedged, the markets and finance podcast from the Financial Times and Pushkin.  I’m Katie Martin, a slightly frazzled markets columnist here at FT towers in London and, exciting times, I’m joined today in person by the alarmingly young and clever Aiden Reiter from the Unhedged newsletter in New York. He’s in London, having briefly escaped the clutches of Rob Armstrong’s reign of terror. Aiden, how are you doing? Aiden Reiter
I’m great. It’s great to be in London and away from towering, imperious Rob. Katie Martin
Yeah. I’m much smaller than him and a lot less scary. So Aiden, one thing you know we like to do with this pod is like, answer questions that people really wanna know the answers to but are too afraid to ask for fear of looking silly. There is no such thing as a silly question on this podcast. Aiden Reiter
Absolutely. Katie Martin
Heaven knows I’ve asked enough of them myself. So just briefly, what are trade tariffs? Why does Donald Trump like them so much? Aiden Reiter
Well, unclear why he loves them so much. He’s really obsessed with them and has been since the ’80s. But a tariff is essentially a tax. Essentially, you’re saying when a good or something comes into the United States or another country, there is going to be an extra duty on top of that good, whether that’s 10 per cent or 20 per cent of the price. And it just fundamentally changes the price for whoever is importing or exporting it, right? It could make it more expensive than a domestic product. It could make it more in line with the domestic product. So the basic idea is you change the economics and the calculus for domestic firms about what they want to import versus export. Katie Martin
Yeah. So if you want to import this stuff from China, it’s gonna cost you. There’s already tariffs on China and there’s gonna be an extra 10 per cent on . . .  Aiden Reiter
Across the board, which is unprecedented, at least in the past 20 years, US and China. Katie Martin
And that means if you’re a US consumer, effectively you pay somewhat more. So this is something that confuses people, right? Who pays the tariffs? Aiden Reiter
And it’s case by case. Sometimes if there’s enough margin and, you know, whoever is the US firm or foreign firm wants to keep their competitive advantage or their market share, they might choose to take on the cost of the tariff and not let it be reflected in the price. Most of the time, especially for low-margin companies, low-margin businesses, a lot of cheap goods, which is often what we get from China, that will be passed on to the consumer. Whether or not that’s, quote unquote, inflation is a much bigger conversation we don’t necessarily need to get into. But at the end of the day, somebody has to pay that tariff. Katie Martin
Yeah. So it’s not always necessarily the case that if you put a 25 per cent tariff on Mexican or Canadian goods, which was what Trump was saying earlier this week, that the consumer ends up paying 25 per cent more. Aiden Reiter
Not always. Katie Martin
It can get smoothed out. But the point is, broadly speaking, Canada and Mexico don’t pay this or China doesn’t pay this. The bill is footed in the US. Aiden Reiter
It could be footed by a Chinese, Canadian or Mexican firm, but that’s generally unlikely. Katie Martin
And so the idea for Trump, like you say, he’s been talking about tariffs since the ’80s. This is something he’s loved for, I think, longer than you’ve been alive. Aiden Reiter
Far longer. Katie Martin
(Laughter) Don’t rub it in. (Aiden laughs) And the idea is if you make it more expensive to import stuff, then US manufacturing will catch up and you’ll make these things yourself and you will make America great again by renewing your exporting industry and your domestic consumption industry. Aiden Reiter To a lot of people in the United States — and there’s definitely some good arguments for and against this view when free trade was, you know, promulgated and, you know, Nafta was put in and WTO was more standardised.  Katie Martin Yeah, all these big trade bodies.  Aiden Reiter
All these big trade bodies and big, you know, trade agreements were put in place, that resulted in a lot of manufacturing going to places where it was cheaper to do that. The US is a more developed economy with higher living standards. It’s more expensive to pay people. It’s also we have higher cost of doing many things the US for good reasons and for bad reasons. So in Donald Trump’s worldview, in many people’s worldview, we need to reset the clock. We need to change the calculus so that manufacturing is not always flowing away from United States. It’s flowing back to the United States. Katie Martin
Now, the tricky thing here, and I don’t wanna get too deep in the weeds, is those things called supply chains, right? Say you want all car manufacturing for Americans to be done in America. There’s a lot of like, nuts and bolts and widgets and bits of car seats and this and that. They’re gonna come from Canada, they’re gonna come from Mexico. So there is very little manufacturing of stuff like that that you can do entirely at home. You’re very reliant on these like, complex webs of relationships between different countries. So slapping taxes on this stuff sounds complicated. Aiden Reiter
Complicated, it’s disruptive. You know, we’ve already created these systems, right? One might endeavour to reform them as opposed to completely end them and sever them. These supply chains already exist. A lot of money has gone into making them. So there are some, you know, the Democratic party and other camps who think this gets rid of the, quote unquote, comparative advantage that certain economies have and whether they can make certain goods more efficiently. It’s a big, meaty topic. But at the end of the day, it’s disruptive to put these tariffs in place. Donald Trump, from the first time he, you know, rolled off that golden escalator in 2015, he’s been, you know, lamenting trade deficits. So it’s not necessarily that the US imports from other places. It’s that it is so uneven that, you know, China exports a tonne of goods to us and we only export some goods to them.  Aiden Reiter
What’s interesting about Trump’s approach so far is that China, not Canada or Mexico, is the place where we have the larger trade deficit. Imports from Canada and Mexico are higher than they are from China. It’s because our supply chains as neighbours are so intensely integrated. But China, there is actually much more of an imbalance. So it’s very surprising to many pundits, especially because China and tariffs on China were a big part of his campaign promises, that the first focus was not China. It was 10 per cent on China. It was 25 per cent on Canada and Mexico, who are allies, who’ve gone to war with us. It was all very confusing. Katie Martin
Yeah. So the choice of targets for tariffs is quite weird. So, yeah, let’s just go back to the long ago, distant days of the weekend. (Laughter) It’s Tuesday as we’re recording this, listeners. What did he say he was gonna do? So it was 25 per cent on Canada, 25 per cent on Mexico. This is like a total stink bomb, right, because no one saw this coming because, again, friends and allies. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. I mean, you know, it’s shocking the market didn’t see it coming because on his first day in office at the end of the day, he did say, I’m thinking by February 1st, we’ll put 25 per cent tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Just nobody thought he would go through with it even though so much of his campaign rhetoric was about tariffs. And again, it’s come back to the point that Canada and Mexico were not seen as the first targets of this, you know, onslaught. Everybody thought he would call it off by Friday. It was known that, you know, Trudeau had called in and there were negotiations between . . .  Katie Martin
First, the Canadian prime minister. Aiden Reiter
The Canadian prime minister, apparently, I’ve heard reports that he was trying to talk to him. Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican president, had very publicly pushed against him; unclear what was going on behind the scenes. So it wasn’t clear if that was actually going to go through. And then over the weekend, he was like, no, it’s going through. We’re doing this. Katie Martin
We’re really gonna do this thing. So that is interesting because . . . let’s look at what the markets did, right? There was, you know, certainly if you looked at social media over the weekend, it was saying, you know, jeez, markets aren’t gonna like this very much. They’re gonna really fall out of bed. They kind of, you know, rolled over in bed, but they didn’t fall out of bed. So we saw . . . So Chinese markets were shut, which is kind of reasonably important to note here. But there was a bit of a sell-off in Asia stocks. There was a decent sell-off in Europe because in Europe investors think, ha, we could be next for this treatment. There was a little bit of a wobble in US stocks and the dollar picked up a little bit. Donald Trump tends to like a weaker dollar, so he doesn’t like the dollar strengthening. So these are all . . .  Aiden Reiter
Well, he’s of two minds. Katie Martin
He’s of two . . . We cannot go into the many, many folds of his brain. Aiden Reiter
(Laughter) Yes, flooding the zone. Katie Martin
Let’s not flood the zone here. But my point is, like, US stocks fell. I think they opened about 1.4 per cent lower. That is lame. That is nowhere near enough. You know, everyone talks about, well, the big kind of controlling factor on Donald Trump is the stock vigilantes. And he’s not gonna want to do anything that upsets markets. I hope you like my little . . .  Aiden Reiter
(Laughter) It’s quite an impression. Katie Martin
My pundit voice there. But the stock vigilantes are asleep at the wheel, right? If you want to get him to like, really change direction, you need markets to fall like a lot more than that. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. I mean, it could have been reflecting two things. It could have been reflecting that the market really never thought this was going to go through even when over the weekend he said it would. They still never believed him. And turns out they were right. Katie Martin
They were right. He backtracked. Aiden Reiter
It also could have been the market potentially underpricing and underappreciating just how integral Canada and Mexico are to many of our supply chains and many of our goods. So just looking very high-level at the numbers, we get 23 per cent of our oil from Canada that we actually consume. That’s 55 per cent of all of our oil imports. And while the US has a lot of shale, it’s a different grade of oil that we get from Canada. And we have a tonne of pipelines that already pump that out. And that’s already a lot of money in the ground and refineries that have already been tooled for that extra-grade crude, right, that heavy stuff. Katie Martin
Didn’t his initial 25 per cent suggestion exclude that stuff, though? Aiden Reiter
Ten per cent, as opposed to 25 per cent. So the first time he announced it, it was 25 per cent on everything. It seems the Trump administration got wind that the oil industry would not be very happy with them. And that was just brought down to 10 per cent. But still, we get so much of our stuff from Canada and so much of our energy from Canada. And while that was 10 per cent, as we wrote in the newsletter yesterday, it’s still pretty high. Katie Martin
That’s a lot. Aiden Reiter
That’s a lot. And it could really fundamentally reshape US oil markets and US energy markets. For Mexico, we get 16 per cent of our imports from Mexico — that’s more imports than we get from Canada — and 35 per cent of our automobiles. And those are integrated supply chains across the US, Canada, China, and crucially, Mexico. And you’d think that, you know, Ford and GM and these big stocks would fall off. And they did have a pretty big drop in the morning, but they pared back later in the day. Katie Martin
Yeah. That’s the thing, right? This restraining factor that comes from the markets does not appear to be there. Now, again, that could be because investors are saying, I don’t believe you. Or it could be that investors are really bad at reading what he’s gonna do next. It could be a combination of these things. But the stabilisers are not there, right? Markets are not there. This idea that, well, he’s appointed Scott Bessent as Treasury secretary. He’s an adult in the room. Don’t worry, he won’t let anything too wild happen. Meh. Looks like his influence is pretty limited at this stage. Aiden Reiter
Unclear. I mean, we have no idea what’s going on behind the scenes there. What we can say, and Unhedged newsletter has written a couple of times about who’s behind the scenes of the Trump econ policy, Bessent is very for a gradual approach, right? We’re gonna give them well, good advance. We’re gonna roll this out sequentially. We’re not just gonna hit the entire world with tariffs, which was originally a campaign proposal. It’s unclear if he influenced him. That being said, I mean, 25 per cent tariffs on Canada and Mexico, while big and alarming, with a week notice is probably more than we expected from Trump on day one based on his rhetoric. So even this could have been showing restraint and that could be Bessent’s influence. Who knows? Katie Martin
Who knows? The counterfactual is always impossible to prove. But what we can prove is, he said over the weekend, I’m absolutely serious about this. This was supposed to kick in sort of at some point this week. And then a few phone calls happen and he’s like, actually, I’ve changed my mind. There’s gonna be a delay, at least, with Mexico and Canada. He’s sticking to China, though. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. So it’s a one-month delay on Canada and Mexico while they renegotiate terms. And this is, aligns with what many feel to be the negotiation tactic of tariffs, right? Some people question whether tariffs were an aim in and of itself. A lot of people think in the case of China, they are, right? We need to fix this trade deficit. A lot of people think they’re just a point of negotiation. And I think that Canada, Mexico and also Colombia last week show that Trump is using them for negotiations. Katie Martin
On stuff that has nothing to do with trade, this is one of the things I think that investors find it so difficult to get around because if they could just look at a series of like, trade balances on an Excel spreadsheet, they could say, OK, this country, this country, this country are the most at risk of tariffs from the US. But actually, he’s looking not necessarily at trade balances. He’s looking at what help are you giving us with the border, whether that’s the border with Canada or the border with Mexico. He’s looking at stuff like the flow of fentanyl in and out of the country. Aiden Reiter
And it’s arguable if it has anything to do with the flow of fentanyl or making the border more secure, right? It could all be, you know, stunting and not actually putting troops there. Who knows? We haven’t seen yet. Yeah. It’s very hard for the market to read when it’s unclear what his actual aims are at the end of the day. Again, to your point, if it were just about trade deficits, we would have known he would have gone for China. And we would have known that he’d go hard on China. But even with China, it’s unclear this is about negotiations. Reading into previous Republican talking points and papers on this, it seems they didn’t find 2018 and 2019 tariff negotiations with China to be particularly fruitful. So it seems that in the case of China, it’s a means in and of itself. But China’s hit-back on the United States today wasn’t completely crushing. And it would seem that they’re just trying to react by not poking the bear but also setting the stage for some negotiation. I mean, that’s a bit of speculation. But they, essentially China hit back with 15 per cent tariffs on US coal exports, 15 per cent on US LNG exports, and then I believe it was 10 per cent on US oil exports. Now, remember that from China we get a lot of goods. It’s last thing Canada, Mexico. But we have a larger trade deficit. And part of that is electronics, which are around 220bn. And that’s anything from like a TV to a washer dryer. Katie Martin
You Americans can’t live without your TVs. Aiden Reiter
Can the Brits? I mean, you have to pay for a licence here. (Laughter) Katie Martin
Sure. (Laughter) Aiden Reiter I guess that means you can live without it. (Both laugh) But, you know, while these are more targeted and seem to be designed to not hurt the Chinese economy, they shouldn’t be completely overlooked in, this case, the US.  Katie Martin
Yes, to a large extent, the US can boss the rest of the world around. But there are limits here. You know, these are other like, sovereign nations with like, tools at their disposal. Now, speaking of which, like the thing that Donald Trump has said would make the whole discussion about Canadian tariffs go away is, well, Canada should join the US, which . . .  Aiden Reiter
I don’t think he wants that. Katie Martin
I mean, how many electoral college votes would it get? Aiden Reiter
Canada has roughly the population of the US’s most populous state, California. That’ll be 28 electoral college votes. And they probably wouldn’t go for Trump. I don’t think the Republicans actually want this. Also, plus two senators. Anyway, I don’t . . . There’s no world in which Canada’s joining the US. Katie Martin
This is not gonna happen, but it would be really good trolling if they did from that point of view. Aiden Reiter
We don’t wanna reward that trolling. Katie Martin
No. OK, let’s park that idea. But so, yeah, in addition to the extra levies that China has imposed on imports from the US, they’ve also taken some quite interesting tacks in terms of they’ve renewed antitrust investigations involving Nvidia and Google. Where these will go, I don’t know, but it’s sand in the gears. And as you say, it’s like a signal that OK, but we’re not gonna take this lying down. We don’t have like, no power here. And the other thing that the Chinese have always got in their back pocket is the currency. Aiden Reiter
Yeah. Katie Martin
They can weaken that thing. Aiden Reiter
Yeah, I mean, it’s largely expected by China analysts that they will allow it to slip past its current band of about, you know, the bottom threshold is 8 yuan to the US dollar, Rmb8. If they do that right, it allows their exports to continue being competitive even with tariffs in place.

Someone’s gonna get cross. I don’t know where we’re gonna end up, but I do know we’re not gonna go there in a straight line.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  In the meantime, we’re gonna be back in a sec with Long/Short.  [MUSIC PLAYING]  Alrighty. Now, it’s time for Long/Short, that part of the show where we go long a thing we love or short a thing we hate. Aiden, what you got? Aiden Reiter
I’m short British tea culture. Not that I . . . Controversial, I know. Not that I don’t love high tea. I’m a huge tea drinker. Love tea, but I really like to find interesting leaves and blends from other countries. Katie Martin
No, no, that’s not how you do it at all. You just drink like, tea. Like, just normal builder’s tea. Aiden Reiter
Well, not even that. But even when you go to like, the nice tea stores in the UK, it’s not like, oh where, what interesting country or styles, this is, like, oh, would you like it with orange blossom or with lavender blossom or with lilac? It’s like, well, what tea is it? And they’re like, what do you mean what tea is it? So I’m short British tea culture. Katie Martin
Oh God. Don’t understand anything. Aiden Reiter
Dead in the comments. (Laughter) Katie Martin
(Laughter) I am long The Penguin. Have you seen it? It’s HBO. Aiden Reiter
Oh, the HBO show. I was like, an animal. Katie Martin
Yeah. So I do like penguins in general, but The Penguin, the HBO show. So, like, desperate scenes in our household after The Traitors ended. Didn’t know what to watch. It was all very sad. But this thing is really good. Colin Farrell is amazing. The Sofia character is amazing. But Colin Farrell’s make-up and like, transformation is something else. Like, you wouldn’t know it was him. Aiden Reiter Here’s like . . . You wouldn’t know it’s him, but you can still tell there’s a gorgeous man under there. You can like, see it in his eyes. It’s like, ooh, that’s a good-looking man even though he’s wearing these, you know, all these prosthetics.  [MUSIC PLAYING] Katie Martin
I did not see that. But sure, I’ll take another look. Aiden Reiter
Watch and just look at his eyes. Katie Martin It’s a big yes for me. Anyway, watch it. OK. We’re gonna be back in your ears on Thursday so listen up then.

[MUSIC PLAYING]",2025-02-04,This is an audio transcript of the Unhedged podcast episode,"In a recent episode of the Unhedged podcast, hosts Katie Martin and Aiden Reiter discuss the implications of Donald Trump's renewed focus on trade tariffs, particularly as they affect relationships with Canada, Mexico, and China. 

**Key Points:**

1. **Understanding Tariffs**: A trade tariff is essentially a tax on imports that can raise prices for consumers. Trump's affinity for tariffs stems from his belief that they can protect U.S. manufacturing by making imported goods more expensive, thus encouraging domestic production.

2. **Impact on Consumers and Markets**: While tariffs might initially be paid by the importing firms, the costs can eventually be passed on to U.S. consumers. The reaction of the stock market to these announced tariffs has been somewhat muted, suggesting investors may not fully believe the permanence or severity of these actions.

3. **Trade Deficits**: Trump points to trade deficits—where the U.S. imports more than it exports—as a problem, particularly with China. The podcast explores why tariffs on Canada and Mexico surprised many, as those countries are less significant sources of imbalance compared to China.

4. **Global Supply Chains**: The discussion emphasizes the complexity of global supply chains, which often involve materials and components sourced from multiple countries. Tariffs can disrupt these established networks.

5. **Negotiation Tactics**: Trump's implementation of tariffs is seen by some as a strategy to negotiate better trade terms rather than just economic protectionism. The hosts highlight how tariffs may be used as leverage in broader negotiations, particularly regarding border security and health issues, rather than solely for trade balance.

6. **Market Responses and Future Implications**: The hosts express uncertainty about how markets will adapt to Trump's tariff strategy and what it means for future U.S. international relationships, especially with allies.

Overall, the podcast captures the confusion surrounding Trump's tariff policies and their intricate relationship with U.S. economic strategy and international trade dynamics."
